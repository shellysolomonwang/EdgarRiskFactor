Item 1A. Risk Factors and discussed throughout Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of AIG for the year ended December 31, 2011, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on February 27, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively (collectively, the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K).    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms AIG, the Company, we, us, and our mean AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries.        USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of ongoing operations as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations.   Management believes that the measures described at Results of Operations — Segment Results enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of the businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. Reconciliations of these measures to pre-tax income, the most directly comparable measurement derived from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), are included in Results of Operations — Segment Results.        EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  This executive overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety, together with the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks, and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  AIG reports its results of operations as follows:   •Chartis — Chartis offers a breadth of insurance products and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. Commercial insurance products are primarily distributed to businesses through insurance brokers. Major lines of business include casualty, property, financial lines and specialty (including aerospace, environmental, surety, marine, trade credit and political risk coverages, and various product offerings to small and medium enterprises). Consumer insurance products are primarily distributed to individual consumers or groups of consumers through individual agents, brokers, and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Consumer lines of business include accident & health (A&H) and personal lines. In addition, life products offered through Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) are included in A&H.  •SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) — SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, A&H, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 83      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Aircraft Leasing — AIG's commercial aircraft leasing business is conducted through ILFC (and, since the date of its acquisition by ILFC on October 7, 2011, AeroTurbine, Inc. (AeroTurbine)).   •Other Operations — AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), Direct Investment book (including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP), Retained Interests (as defined below) and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).         PRIOR PERIOD REVISIONS  Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the following:   Accounting for Deferred Acquisition Costs   As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG retrospectively adopted an accounting standard on January 1, 2012 that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts.  The impact to AIG shareholders' equity and Net income (loss) attributable to AIG previously reported in 2011 is summarized below:                    At December 31, (in millions)   2011            AIG shareholders' equity as previously reported   $ 104,951      Impact of adoption of new standard on AIG Shareholders' equity     (3,413 )          AIG shareholders' equity as currently reported   $ 101,538                                  Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011            Net income attributable to AIG as previously reported   $ 269      Impact of adoption of new standard on Net income attributable to AIG     1,028            Net income attributable to AIG as currently reported   $ 1,297              Chartis Segment Changes   To align financial reporting with changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, certain products previously reported in Commercial Insurance were reclassified to Consumer Insurance. These revisions did not affect the total Chartis segment results previously reported.        FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  Income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2012 of $4.6 billion primarily consists of:   •pre-tax income from insurance operations of $1.8 billion   •total increase in fair value and realized gain on AIG's interests in AIA ordinary shares of $1.8 billion; and •an increase in fair value of AIG's interests in ML III of $1.3 billion due to tightening credit spreads.    Pre-tax income from insurance operations reflected Chartis' continued benefit from growth in higher value lines of businesses and geographies and improving pricing trends. Chartis results included catastrophe losses of  84 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. $80 million and net prior year adverse development of $66 million in the first quarter of 2012. SunAmerica is benefiting from its broad portfolio of competitive products, diverse and strong distribution relationships, and continued discipline in product pricing. SunAmerica results benefited from the reinvestment of cash in 2011 and positive equity market performance in the first quarter of 2012. Partially offsetting SunAmerica's improvements were lower returns from hedge funds and private equity investments in the first quarter of 2012.   Loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2011 of $1.3 billion primarily consisted of:   •pre-tax income from insurance operations of $0.6 billion, reflecting catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion, largely arising from the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami in Japan;  •a $3.3 billion charge, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the credit facility provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY, and such credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility) in 2011; and   •increases in total changes in fair value in AIG's interests in AIA ordinary shares and its ML III interest of $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively.    In 2011, AIG recorded income from discontinued operations net of taxes of $2.6 billion, which included a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2011 on the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison).        CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  In the first quarter of 2012, AIG paid down the remaining preferred interests in the AIA Group Limited (AIA) special purpose vehicle (the AIA SPV, and such interests, the AIA SPV Preferred Interests) held by the Department of the Treasury. In addition, the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering (the Offering) of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), in which it sold approximately 207 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of $6.0 billion. AIG purchased approximately 103 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the Offering for an aggregate purchase amount of approximately $3.0 billion. As a result of the Department of the Treasury's sale of AIG Common Stock and AIG's purchase of shares in the Offering, ownership by the Department of the Treasury was reduced from approximately 77 percent to approximately 70 percent of the AIG Common Stock outstanding after the completion of the Offering. AIG expects that the Department of the Treasury will seek to further reduce its ownership interest in AIG over time through additional secondary offerings or open market sales. Depending upon market conditions, available capital resources and liquidity, and any repurchase authorization then available, AIG may determine to participate as a purchaser in such secondary offerings.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries herein for further discussion and other capital resources and liquidity developments.        OUTLOOK       PRIORITIES FOR 2012  AIG remains committed to its long-term aspirational goals and is focused on the following priorities for 2012:   •continuing to strengthen and grow AIG's core businesses;  •implementing a strategic alternative for ILFC through an initial public offering or sale;   •managing its capital and interest expense more efficiently;  •taking appropriate actions to prepare for scenarios under which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) would become AIG's regulator;   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 85      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •continuing to build, strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure and control environment throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources; and  •restructuring AIG's operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness.         REGULATORY  On October 18, 2011, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) published a second notice of proposed rulemaking and related interpretive guidance under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) regarding the designation of non-bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). On April 3, 2012, the FSOC formally adopted the rule in substantially the same form as proposed. The rule sets forth a three-stage determination process for designating non-bank SIFIs. In Stage 1, FSOC would apply a set of uniform quantitative thresholds to identify the nonbank financial companies that will be subject to further evaluation. AIG expects that the FSOC will make its Stage 1 identifications before the end of 2012. Based on its financial condition as of March 31, 2012, AIG would meet the criteria in Stage 1 and would be subject to further evaluation by the FSOC in the SIFI determination process. Because Stages 2 and 3 would involve qualitative judgment by the FSOC, AIG cannot predict whether it would be designated as a non-bank SIFI under the rule.   AIG's insurance companies, like other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. State regulation relates primarily to financial condition as well as corporate conduct and market conduct activities; in particular, states have also become increasingly aggressive in using escheatment laws to seek recovery of unclaimed life insurance benefits. There are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations, and a review of insurance solvency regulation throughout the U.S. regulatory system, which could significantly affect AIG's insurance businesses. At the federal level, Dodd-Frank will subject AIG's insurance subsidiaries, investment advisors, broker-dealers and their affiliates to additional federal regulation. In addition, regulators and lawmakers around the world are developing recommendations to address issues such as financial group supervision, corporate governance, enterprise risk management, capital and solvency standards, and related issues, which could potentially affect AIG and its subsidiaries.   In March 2011, federal regulators, as required by Dodd-Frank, issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) in respect of which issuers of asset-backed securities would not be subject to certain risk retention requirements. The QRM definition included, among other standards, a maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80 percent for a home purchase transaction. The LTV is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan. The final regulations could adversely impact UGC's volume of domestic first-lien new insurance written, depending on the final definition of a QRM, the maximum LTV allowed and the benefit, if any, ascribed to private mortgage insurance.        CHARTIS  Given the continued global economic environment and current property and casualty market conditions, 2012 is expected to remain challenging, but improving trends in certain key indicators may offset some of the challenges. Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, Chartis has observed continuing positive pricing trends, particularly in its U.S. commercial business. In certain growth economies such as Brazil, Turkey, India, and Asia Pacific countries, Chartis continues to expect improved growth.   Strategy   Chartis continues to make strides in its strategy to further grow its higher value and less capital intensive lines of business, and to implement corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management continues to review the businesses to evaluate their contribution to overall performance objectives.  86 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Chartis seeks to provide value for people and businesses worldwide through the identification and efficient management of risk. In pursuing this mission and in growing its intrinsic value, Chartis has established strategic initiatives in several key areas. Initiatives in these areas are helping Chartis to direct its capital and resources to optimize financial results, while acknowledging that performance in these areas may vary from quarter to quarter depending upon local market conditions, such as pricing and the effects of foreign exchange rates or changes in the investment environment.    •Business Mix Shift — Chartis seeks to continue to diversify its business portfolio, while retaining the flexibility to capitalize on sustainable profit in products and geographies of opportunity. Chartis believes that there is an opportunity to shift its current mix of business toward growth economy nations, such as China, India and Brazil among others, and to higher value lines such as consumer business and specialty commercial lines.     •Commercial Insurance is effectively utilizing global underwriting and product best practices to target high value customers and geographies. Chartis is leveraging its significant global footprint and multinational capabilities to serve large and mid-sized businesses with cross-border operations. Commercial Insurance is also expanding its presence in the growth economy nations. In the Americas and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, Commercial Insurance expects to focus on the higher value lines within its portfolio and to capitalize on market opportunities.   •Consumer Insurance continues to grow its net premiums written in key markets and to expand internationally, particularly in growth economy nations. Consumer Insurance growth strategies span multiple distribution channels and include direct to consumer, agent, broker and affinity groups. In the Asia Pacific region, the acquisition of Fuji enables the continued introduction of a breadth of products across its distribution channels and customer base. In the Americas region, Consumer Insurance continues to focus its growth in niche areas, such as the high net worth market, geographic expansion in Latin America, and the implementation of a U.S. group benefits strategy with American General Life Companies (American General). In the EMEA region, management expects modest growth and will continue to focus on profitable underwriting performance.   •Loss Ratio Improvement — Chartis is continuing to focus on reducing the costs associated with adjusting claims by improving the effectiveness and efficiency in servicing its customers, thus improving its loss ratio. Chartis is placing emphasis on streamlining its claims operations, implementing effective technology and processes and the use of fraud detection tools to create a competitive advantage. Analyzing actuarial, underwriting, claims and legal data is helping Chartis develop its knowledge of the structural drivers of losses and improve pricing. Chartis is addressing these loss drivers proactively to mitigate their impact on reserve development and legal costs. Current accident year loss ratios are starting to show improvement and Chartis expects this trend to continue.  •Expense Discipline — To achieve expense reductions, Chartis plans to take advantage of its global footprint to improve efficiencies and expand the use of shared services to support regional businesses in strategic locations, reduce use of external services and negotiate preferred rates with vendors. As a result of the business mix shift and the investment in the growth economy nations, policy acquisition expenses are expected to increase in 2012. Chartis expects, however, that these changes will ultimately help to generate business with overall more favorable underwriting results. Chartis continues to make strategic investments in systems processes and capabilities worldwide, which will increase expenses in the short-term, but should create additional value and greater efficiency in the future.   •Risk Selection — Chartis is implementing enhanced pricing, risk selection and account management tools, and marketing analytics that Chartis believes enable underwriters to better select and price risks. Further changes include greater actuarial involvement in product aggregate pricing and attachments, widespread utilization of pricing and predictive models with actuarial support, policy form changes, increased policy exclusions and fewer multi-year policies being offered. During 2011, as part of its ongoing initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines, Chartis determined to cease writing Excess Workers'   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 87      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Compensation business on a stand-alone basis. Based on this decision, Chartis includes this legacy line of business in Chartis Other and not in the ongoing Commercial Insurance operating results.    Capital Deployment   In 2012, Chartis expects to continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units and executing underwriting and reinsurance strategies to improve capital ratios and reduce volatility, increase return on equity by line of business and reduce exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends.   Chartis continues to streamline its legal entity structure, to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. During 2012, Chartis completed 18 legal entity restructuring transactions. In preparation for Solvency II compliance, Chartis Ireland was merged into Chartis Europe Limited as the first step towards achieving the overall plan to create a single Pan-European insurance carrier that will simplify the legal entity structure in Europe by the end of 2012, subject to regulatory approvals.   Investments   For 2012, Chartis expects to continue to refine its investment strategy, which includes asset diversification and yield-enhancement opportunities that meet Chartis' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   See Segment Results — Chartis Operations — Chartis Results — Chartis Investing and Other Results and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.        SUNAMERICA  SunAmerica continues to pursue its goals of expanding the breadth and depth of its distribution relationships, introducing competitive new products and product enhancements, disciplined life insurance underwriting, maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and strong statutory surplus, proactively managing expenses and, subject to regulatory approval, continuing to make distributions to AIG Parent. SunAmerica expects to continue to make progress on all of these efforts in 2012.   Business Environment    •Low interest rates and equity market volatility — SunAmerica's businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and equity market volatility. Equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features, and both equity market volatility and low interest rates can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of deferred acquisition costs. Continued low interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect future sales of interest rate-sensitive products and reduce future profits.   •Future investment returns — Products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate-adjustable may require increases in reserves if changes in estimates of future investment returns result in projected future losses. SunAmerica would not expect in 2012 a DAC unlocking or increase in reserves due to loss recognition solely as a result of the low interest rate environment. However, because of the long-term nature of certain contracts for which reserving assumptions are established upon issuance of the contracts, small changes in certain of the original assumptions, particularly estimates of future invested asset returns, may cause large changes in the amount of reserve adequacy. The sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition of $87 million in the first quarter of 2012. Additional sales of such securities are contemplated in 2012, which could result in additional loss recognition or reserve increases in future periods. See Results of Operations — Segment Results — SunAmerica Operations.   88 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Organizational Realignment   On April 12, 2012, SunAmerica announced several key organizational structure and management changes intended to better serve the organization's distribution partners and customers. Key aspects of the new structure are distinct product divisions, shared annuity and life operations platforms and a unified all-channel distribution organization with access to all SunAmerica products.   Variable Annuities   SunAmerica variable annuity sales increased as various distribution partners, including SunAmerica's largest pre-financial-crisis variable annuity distribution partner, resumed sales of SunAmerica's products during 2011. As a result of broader distribution opportunities, SunAmerica expects variable annuity sales to remain strong in 2012.   SunAmerica has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts, caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. SunAmerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a significant portion of the interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, SunAmerica began purchasing U.S. Treasury notes as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce this interest rate risk exposure over time.   In amortizing DAC, value of business acquired (VOBA) and sales inducement assets (SIA), SunAmerica uses a reversion to mean methodology to account for fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business. Favorable separate account returns could trigger a favorable unlocking, where the reversion to mean assumption is reset. If current favorable equity market returns continue in 2012, such an unlocking could occur later in 2012. Such positive unlocking is not expected to be significant to SunAmerica's operating results but could result in higher amortization amounts in future periods.   Fixed Annuities   Changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. If the low interest rate environment continues, SunAmerica expects fixed annuities sales (including deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) to continue to be below 2011 levels for the remainder of 2012.   Life Insurance   SunAmerica's strategic focus for mortality-based products includes disciplined underwriting, active expense management and product innovation. SunAmerica's distribution strategy is to grow new sales by strengthening the core retail independent and career agent distributor channels, expanding its market presence to additional channels and niche markets, and making investments in enhanced service technology.   SunAmerica's retail life sales continued to show strong growth, increasing 7 percent during the first three months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Term life sales have increased, while the economic environment has put pressure on the sales of universal life products, which typically have higher annual premiums than term products and also offer additional features.   The direct-to-consumer channel has proven effective for the distribution of term life policies and A&H products, and provides opportunities to bring innovative product solutions to the market that take advantage of new underwriting technologies. Sales of SunAmerica's term life policies through its affiliated Matrix Direct channel in the first quarter of 2012 were up more than 50 percent compared to the same period in 2011, due in part to the shift toward selling proprietary products. The career distribution channel is focused on improving agent retention and productivity through improved point-of-sale technologies.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 89      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Interest Crediting Rates   The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in SunAmerica products may have the effect, in a continued low interest rate environment, of reducing SunAmerica's spreads and thus reducing future profitability. SunAmerica partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset-liability management process, product design elements, and crediting rate strategies. A prolonged low interest rate environment may, nevertheless, negatively affect spreads on interest-sensitive business.   As of March 31, 2012, the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities consisted of intermediate- and long-term fixed maturity securities. SunAmerica generally purchases assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of maturities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. Opportunistic investments in structured securities continue to be made to improve yields, increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment.   SunAmerica's annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be re-set at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Therefore, on new business currently written, as well as on in-force business above minimum guarantees, SunAmerica has adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates in order to maintain targeted interest rate spreads.   New fixed annuity sales have declined in the first quarter of 2012 relative to the same period in the prior year, as consumers appeared reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively lower crediting rates offered. However, even in the current interest rate environment, SunAmerica continues to pursue new sales at targeted interest rate spreads. These annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees at 1 percent. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted interest spreads when considering the returns of invested proceeds.   As a result of these actions, SunAmerica estimates that if interest rates remain at or near current levels through the end of 2013, full year 2012 and 2013 pre-tax operating income will not be materially impacted.   As indicated in the table below, approximately 51 percent of SunAmerica's annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of March 31, 2012. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of March 31, 2012 ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing older product guarantees.  The following table presents account values by range of current minimum guaranteed interest rates and current crediting rates for SunAmerica's universal life and deferred fixed annuity products and fixed account options of variable annuity products:                                                               Current Crediting Rates      March 31, 2012 Contractual Minimum Guaranteed Interest Rate Account Values (in millions)   At Contractual Minimum Guarantee   1-50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   More than 50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   Total            Universal life insurance                              1%   $ -   $ -   $ 15   $ 15      > 1% - 2%     -     -     220     220      > 2% - 3%     64     211     1,485     1,760      > 3% - 4%     1,622     234     1,662     3,518      > 4% - 5%     4,923     80     190     5,193      > 5% - 5.5%     320     3     5     328            Subtotal   $ 6,929   $ 528   $ 3,577   $ 11,034            Fixed annuities                              1%   $ 186   $ 780   $ 7,562   $ 8,528      > 1% - 2%     2,026     8,136     13,445     23,607      > 2% - 3%     24,780     5,007     8,820     38,607       90 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

AIRCRAFT LEASING  On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any offering or that an offering will be completed.   Challenges in the global economy, including the European sovereign debt crisis, political uncertainty in the Middle East, and sustained higher fuel prices, have negatively impacted many airlines' profitability, cash flows and liquidity, and increased the probability that some airlines, including ILFC customers, will cease operations or file for bankruptcy. During the first three months of 2012, ILFC has had four lessees cease operations or file for bankruptcy (or its equivalent) and these lessees returned 42 aircraft to ILFC. As of April 27, 2012, 28 aircraft have been committed to new leases, 10 are intended for part-out, one has been sold and three remain to be re-leased. Future events, including a prolonged recession, ongoing uncertainty regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, political unrest, continued weak consumer demand, high fuel prices, or restricted availability of credit to the aviation industry could lead to the weakening or cessation of operations of additional airlines, which in turn would adversely affect ILFC's earnings and cash flows.        OTHER OPERATIONS  Mortgage Guaranty   The following will continue to affect results in 2012:   •Market developments — UGC believes it is a market leader in the mortgage insurance industry with a differentiated risk-based pricing model producing new high quality business. The withdrawal of certain competitors from the market combined with the differentiation strategy that UGC implemented in late 2010 and early 2011 has positioned the company to take advantage of market opportunities. UGC is continuing to execute this strategy during 2012. In the first quarter of 2012, UGC increased pricing nationally by approximately two percent.  •Delinquent inventory review — Beginning in the third quarter of 2011 and continuing into the first quarter of 2012, UGC requested that lenders file claims in accordance with the terms of the respective master policies on approximately 20,000 accounts that had been delinquent approximately 24 months or more and were not expected to be cured. Many of these delinquencies were the result of the foreclosure moratorium discussed below. Through March 31, 2012, UGC received responses to approximately 70 percent of these requests. The claims arising from these requests have resulted in coverage rescissions and claim denials at levels higher than previously experienced. UGC has considered these higher levels of rescissions and denials   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 91      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  and the potential for higher levels of overturns in estimating its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. Over the remainder of 2012, reserve development and premium refunds associated with these claim requests will continue to impact the business, especially in the fourth quarter of 2012 when UGC expects overturn activity related to these delinquencies to be at their highest. UGC continues to monitor and review the status of these requests and plans to contact lenders on an ongoing basis regarding additional delinquencies that meet these criteria. Under the terms of these master policies, if a claim is not submitted within a year of UGC's request, coverage will be cancelled.   •Foreclosure moratoriums — The state attorneys general investigations into lenders' foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 have slowed the reporting of claims from foreclosures, which has increased the uncertainty surrounding the determination of the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses. UGC's assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend, although significant uncertainty remains surrounding the determination of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. UGC expects that this trend may continue for the remainder of 2012 and may negatively affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is uncertain and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution, individually or collectively, may have on its future results of operations or financial condition. As discussed above, UGC has requested that lenders file claims on delinquent loans that would, under normal conditions, have been foreclosed in an effort to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the foreclosure moratorium. UGC expects to continue this practice as long as significant delays in reporting foreclosures continue.    Global Capital Markets   The remaining AIGFP portfolio is managed opportunistically, consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.   Direct Investment Book   MIP assets and liabilities and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP (collectively the Direct Investment book or DIB) are currently managed collectively on a single program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent. Liquidity requirements for the DIB are managed by transferring cash between AIG Parent and AIGFP as needed.   Program management is focused on winding down this portfolio over time, and reducing and managing its liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting, for both derivative and debt positions of the DIB. As part of this program management, AIG may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, AIG may seek to buy back debt or sell assets on an opportunistic basis, subject to market conditions.   Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.  92 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   Retained Interests   Retained Interests may continue to experience volatility due to fair value gains or losses on the AIA ordinary shares and the retained interests in ML III. At March 31, 2012, AIG owned approximately 19 percent of the outstanding shares of AIA. A change of one Hong Kong dollar in AIA's share price would result in an approximate $289 million change in AIG's pre-tax income.   AIG has incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.

Premiums and Policy Fees   Premiums were consistent with the prior year period and primarily reflect a four percent decline in net premiums written at Chartis that was offset by the change in unearned premiums in 2012. The decline in Chartis net premiums written is primarily attributable to declines in Casualty classes of business in Commercial Insurance that were partially offset by increases in each of the Consumer Insurance lines of business. These results reflect Chartis' strategy to improve pricing and grow in higher value, less volatile lines of business and geographies. See additional discussion regarding Chartis net premiums written at Chartis Results — Chartis Net Premiums Written.   Policy fees increased slightly due to higher variable annuity living benefit fees.  94 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Net Investment Income  The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Fixed maturity securities, including short-term investments    $ 3,104    $ 2,691      15 %    Change in fair value of ML II      246      251      (2 )    Change in fair value of ML III      1,252      744      68      Change in fair value of AIA securities including realized gain in 2012      1,795      1,062      69      Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to their sale      -      (157 )    NM      Equity securities      11      18      (39 )    Interest on mortgage and other loans      265      267      (1 )    Alternative investments*      415      654      (37 )    Mutual funds      8      49      (84 )    Real estate      26      25      4      Other investments      105      92      14            Total investment income      7,227      5,696      27      Investment expenses      122      127      (4 )          Net investment income    $ 7,105    $ 5,569      28 %             * Includes hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships.    Net investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 included the following:   •gains of $0.6 billion related to the sale of 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares in March 2012;   •fair value gains of $1.2 billion on AIG's remaining AIA ordinary shares; and   •fair value gains of $1.3 billion of AIG's ML III interest due to tightening credit spreads.    Interest income from fixed maturity securities increased in 2012 reflecting the 2011 liquidity redeployment.   Net investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 primarily reflected income from fixed maturity securities and fair values gains on the investment of AIA ordinary shares.   Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net realized capital gains (losses):                          Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Sales of fixed maturity securities    $ 474    $ 133      256 %    Sales of equity securities      448      103      335      Other-than-temporary impairments:                        Severity      (4 )    (8 )    50      Change in intent      (20 )    (4 )    (400 )    Foreign currency declines      (5 )    (2 )    (150 )    Issuer-specific credit events      (586 )    (227 )    (158 )    Adverse projected cash flows      (3 )    (13 )    77      Provision for loan losses      2      15      (87 )    Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to their sale      -      (191 )    NM      Foreign exchange transactions      (232 )    (688 )    66      Derivative instruments      (314 )    306      NM      Other      (63 )    (72 )    13            Net realized capital losses    $ (303 )  $ (648 )    53             AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 95      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  AIG recognized lower net realized capital losses due to the following:   •gains on sales of bonds and equity securities, which included a $426 million gain on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P.; and  •Foreign exchange losses during the first quarter of 2012, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro and the British Pound. Foreign exchange losses during the first quarter of 2011 were primarily on foreign denominated debt due to weakening of the U.S. Dollar against most foreign currencies, including the Euro and the British Pound.    These gains were partially offset by the following:   •higher other-than-temporary impairments on RMBS resulting from an increase in the non-agency portfolio. In addition, negative fluctuations in model outputs or collateral performance generate lower recovery values which result in other-than-temporary impairments;   •higher other-than-temporary impairment on partnership portfolios; and  •derivative losses driven primarily by significant spread tightening.    Aircraft Leasing Revenues and Expenses   Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly, primarily due to the impact of lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet and the limited delivery schedule of new aircraft over the past year, offset by an increase from the consolidation of AeroTurbine. In 2012, ILFC's average fleet size remained relatively stable compared to 2011.   ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $55 million in 2012 compared to $113 million in 2011. See Segment Results — Aircraft Leasing Operations — Aircraft Leasing Results for additional information.   Other Income and Expenses   The decline in Other income was driven by:   •a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $191 million in 2012 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $300 million in 2011 on the AIGFP non-derivative assets and liabilities due to the adverse impact of tightening of AIG's credit spreads on DIB liabilities carried at fair value;  •an unrealized market valuation gain of $140 million in 2012 compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $323 million in 2011 on the super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio, primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDO), driven by price movements and amortization within the CDS portfolio; and •a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $22 million in 2012 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $28 million in 2011 on the AIGFP derivative assets and liabilities due to a tightening of AIG's credit spreads relative to those of its counterparties.    Other expenses increased in 2012 due to ongoing corporate initiatives and higher compensation expense.   Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred   Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased as a result of higher catastrophe losses for Chartis in 2011 primarily due to the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and earthquakes in New Zealand.   Acquisition Costs and Insurance Expenses   Amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased primarily due to Chartis' continued strategy to grow higher margin Consumer Insurance business, which carries higher acquisition costs than Commercial Insurance, and change in mix of business to more profitable lines with higher acquistion costs.  96 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased as a result of increases in bad debt expense, compensation expense and expenses related to strategic initiatives for Chartis, and as a result of a decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities arising from the Fuji acquisition.   Interest Expense   Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $72 million in 2011 through the date of termination, including amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of $48 million.   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt   The loss on extinguishment of debt for 2011 included a $3.3 billion charge consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility.   Income Taxes   Interim Tax Calculation Method   AIG uses the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to that item is treated discretely, and is reported in the same period as the related item. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, the tax effects of the gains on Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and certain dispositions, including a portion of the ordinary shares of AIA and the common units of The Blackstone Group L.P., as well as certain actual and projected gains on SunAmerica's available-for-sale securities were treated as discrete items.   Interim Tax Expense (Benefit)   For the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations was 25.0 percent. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2012 attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and investments in partnerships, and a decrease in the life insurance business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains on sales of SunAmerica's available-for sale-securities.   For the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pretax loss from continuing operations was 17.3 percent. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011 attributable to continuing operations differed from the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations for the U.S. consolidated income tax group, tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, investments in partnerships, and changes in uncertain tax positions.   See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   Discontinued Operations   Results from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 include a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion on the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 97      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       SEGMENT RESULTS  AIG presents and discusses its financial information in the following manner, which it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users:   •Chartis — Operating income (loss). During the first quarter of 2012, AIG revised the non-GAAP measure for Chartis to operating income (loss), which includes both underwriting income and investment income, but not net realized capital gains (losses) or other income (expense);  •SunAmerica — Operating income (loss). During the first quarter of 2012, AIG revised its definition of operating income (loss) to exclude changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, and adjustments to reserves related to net realized capital losses. In addition to the above items, SunAmerica also excludes net realized capital gains (losses) and the related DAC, VOBA and SIA amortization from Operating income (loss);  •Aircraft Leasing — Operating income (loss), which is pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses); and  •Mortgage Guaranty — Underwriting profit (loss), which is income (loss) before net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).    Results from discontinued operations are excluded from these measures.   AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.  The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment.

Chartis Other consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including Excess Workers' Compensation written on a stand-alone basis, and Asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior). It also includes certain Chartis expenses relating to global initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income and realized capital gains and losses.  98 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  The historical Chartis financial information has been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain products that were previously reported in the Commercial Insurance operating segment to the Consumer Insurance operating segment. This change aligns the financial reporting with the changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the Chartis segment to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. These revisions did not impact the total Chartis reportable segment results previously reported.   Complementing this structure, Chartis is organized into the following three regions:    •Americas: Includes the United States and Canada, as well as Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda.   •Asia Pacific: Includes Japan and other Asia Pacific nations, including China, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and Indonesia.   •EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa): Includes the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.    On January 25, 2012, Chartis acquired Service Net Warranty LLC (Service Net). Service Net is a service management company that delivers a full range of industry-leading service solutions in the United States, including warranty management administration, extended service programs, customer service support, service network management, claims processing services, and service contract underwriting. The acquisition of Service Net provides value-added services to Chartis' warranty clients by adding access to an integrated repair and service network. Chartis has integrated Service Net into its Consumer Insurance operating segment. This acquisition did not have a significant effect on 2012 results.   Chartis Results  The following table presents Chartis results:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Underwriting results:                        Net premiums written    $ 8,820    $ 9,166      (4 )%    Increase in unearned premiums      (132 )    (515 )    74            Net premiums earned      8,688      8,651      -      Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred      5,909      7,756      (24 )    Underwriting expenses      2,959      2,498      18            Underwriting loss      (180 )    (1,603 )    89      Net investment income      1,223      1,179      4            Operating income (loss)      1,043      (424 )    NM      Net realized capital gains (losses)      (135 )    50      NM      Other income (expense) – net      2      -      NM            Pre-tax income (loss)    $ 910    $ (374 )    NM %            Operating income in 2012 was $1.0 billion, compared to a $424 million operating loss in 2011. The increase in operating income primarily reflected lower catastrophe losses and the impact of underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection, partially offset by higher expenses. Catastrophe losses in 2012 were $80 million, compared with $1.7 billion in 2011. Net prior year adverse reserve development was $66 million in 2012, compared with $23 million in 2011.       Chartis Net Premiums Written    Net premiums written are the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as a component of unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheet.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 99                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

The primary currencies impacting foreign exchange are the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen.  The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Chartis net premiums written:                    Three Months Ended March 31,   2012 vs. 2011            Decrease in original currency*      (4.5 )%    Foreign exchange effect      0.8            Decrease as reported in U.S. dollars      (3.7 )%             * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.    Overall, Chartis' net premiums written decreased by $346 million, primarily due to a $501 million decrease in Commercial Insurance net premiums written, partially offset by a $180 million increase in Consumer Insurance net premiums written.  The following table presents Chartis' net premiums written by region:                                 Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   Percent of Total   2011   Percent of Total   Percentage Change            Americas    $ 4,107      47 %  $ 4,359      47 %    (6 )%    Asia Pacific      2,472      28      2,355      26      5      EMEA      2,241      25      2,452      27      (9 )          Total net premiums written    $ 8,820      100 %  $ 9,166      100 %    (4 )%            The Americas net premiums written decreased as expected primarily due to the restructuring of the loss sensitive Casualty book of business. This was partially offset by continued growth in Consumer Insurance. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased by 5.5 percent.   Asia Pacific net premiums written increased due to Consumer Insurance leveraging the acquisition of Fuji to continue expansion of new production across its distribution channels and customer base. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written grew by 0.9 percent.   EMEA net premiums written decreased primarily due to the execution of Commercial Insurance's strategies of increased underwriting discipline, particularly in primary casualty, and rate strengthening initiatives. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased by 5.9 percent.  100 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Chartis Underwriting Ratios   The following table summarizes the Chartis combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts on the Chartis consolidated loss and combined ratios:                          Three Months Ended March 31,   2012   2011   Increase (Decrease)            Loss ratio      68.0      89.7      (21.7 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (0.9 )    (19.9 )    19.0      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.8 )    (0.4 )    (0.4 )          Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted      66.3      69.4      (3.1 )          Expense ratio      34.1      28.9      5.2            Combined ratio      102.1      118.6      (16.5 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (0.9 )    (19.9 )    19.0      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.8 )    (0.4 )    (0.4 )          Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted      100.4      98.3      2.1             The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Chartis:                        Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011            Prior year adverse loss development, net of reinsurance    $ 53    $ 26      Change in loss reserve discount      19      34      Returned (additional) premium on loss-sensitive business      (6 )    (37 )          Net prior year adverse loss development    $ 66    $ 23              Loss Ratios   The decrease in the loss ratio reflects the decreased catastrophe losses, as shown in the table below, coupled with the benefit from positive pricing trends and the execution of Chartis' strategic initiatives, including business mix changes and risk selection. The loss ratio in the prior year was primarily impacted by the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and the earthquakes in New Zealand.   In 2012, prior year adverse development is due to the net impact of claims emergence in Casualty reserves, offset by beneficial development from catastrophe-related reserves of $148 million. In 2011, prior year adverse development is due to the net impact of claims emergence in non-catastrophic reserves, offset by beneficial development from catastrophes of $40 million. The increase in the beneficial development from catastrophe-related reserves is due primarily to the unique severity of 2011 catastrophes.  The following table presents Chartis accident year catastrophe losses by major event:                                        2012    2011      Three Months Ended March 31,   Commercial Insurance   Consumer Insurance       Commercial Insurance   Consumer Insurance         (in millions)   Total   Total            Event:*                                          Alabama tornadoes    $ 20   $ -   $ 20   $ -   $ -   $ -      Midwest & Southeast U.S. tornadoes      56     4     60     -     -     -      Tohoku Catastrophe      -     -     -     834     463     1,297      New Zealand Christchurch earthquakes      -     -     -     197     10     207      Northeast Australia floods      -     -     -     91     6     97      All other events      -     -     -     77     10     87            Claims and claim expenses      76     4     80     1,199     489     1,688      Reinstatement premiums      -     -     -     39     -     39            Total catastrophe-related charges    $ 76   $ 4   $ 80   $ 1,238   $ 489   $ 1,727               * Events shown in the above table are catastrophic events, the net impact of which on Chartis is in excess of $20 million each. All other events in 2011 include events that are considered catastrophic but the net impact of which remains below the $20 million itemization threshold.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 101      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Expense Ratios   The expense ratio increased by 5.2 points compared to 2011. In 2012, expenses increased by $99 million due to additional bad debt allowances of approximately $55 million, compared to a reduction in 2011 of approximately $44 million. In addition, the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities for Fuji decreased by approximately $62 million. These two items contributed approximately 1.9 points to the expense ratio increase. Expenses increased by approximately 2.0 points due to increased acquisition costs resulting from changes in business mix and higher commission rates. Consumer Insurance generally has higher acquisition costs than Commercial Insurance, but management expects that over time this business mix change will result in relatively lower loss ratios and improved combined ratios.   Chartis also continued to invest in a number of strategic initiatives during 2012, including the implementation of global finance and information systems, preparation for Solvency II compliance and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives. Such investments totaled $49 million in 2012, representing an increase of approximately $24 million over 2011. Chartis incurred higher personnel costs, as it continued to attract, retain and develop its human capital and to better align employee performance with Chartis and AIG strategic goals. These items contributed 1.0 point to the expense ratio increase.       Chartis Investing and Other Results   The following table presents Chartis' investing and other results:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Net investment income    $ 1,223    $ 1,179      4 %    Net realized capital gains (losses)      (135 )    50      NM      Other income (expense) – net      2      -      NM            Investing and other results    $ 1,090    $ 1,229      (11 )%            Chartis manages and accounts for its invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements. Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as Chartis Other. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately indentified for the Commercial and Consumer Insurance operating segments.   Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based upon the loss reserves, unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to Chartis Other.   Net Investment Income   Net investment income increased due to increases in interest income on fixed maturity securities driven by the redeployment of excess cash and short-term investments into longer term and higher yield securities during the second half of 2011. Net investment income also increased by $18 million due to U.S. group benefits strategy with American General, all of which is reported in Consumer Insurance.   These increases were offset by:   •decreases in partnership income, reflective of the overall lower returns in the equity markets for the respective periods; and   102 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •decreases in mutual fund income as a result of Chartis selling a significant portion of its mutual fund holdings during the second half of 2011.    Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)   Net realized capital losses were driven by:   •Other than temporary impairments of $203 million, which primarily include $94 million and $98 million attributable to RMBS and partnership investments, respectively; and  •Impairment charges of $58 million within other invested assets related to life settlement contracts.    These items were offset in part by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity securities of $169 million during the quarter.       Commercial Insurance    Commercial Insurance distributes its products through a network of agencies, independent retail and wholesale brokers, and branches. These products are categorized into four major lines of business:    •Casualty: Includes general liability, commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages. Also includes risk management and other customized structured programs for large corporate customers and multinational companies.   •Property: Includes industrial and commercial property insurance products, which cover exposures to man-made and natural disasters.   •Specialty: Includes environmental, political risk, trade credit, surety, marine, and aerospace insurance, and various product offerings for small-medium enterprises.   •Financial: Includes various forms of professional liability insurance, including director and officer (D&O), fidelity, employment practices, fiduciary liability, network security, kidnap and ransom, and errors and omissions coverages that protect individual insureds and corporate entities.    Commercial Insurance Results  The following table presents Commercial Insurance results:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Underwriting results:                        Net premiums written    $ 5,223    $ 5,724      (9 )%    Increase in unearned premiums      (35 )    (442 )    92            Net premiums earned      5,188      5,282      (2 )    Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred      3,846      5,206      (26 )    Underwriting expenses      1,518      1,244      22            Underwriting loss      (176 )    (1,168 )    85            Net investment income      741      784      (5 )          Operating income (loss)    $ 565    $ (384 )    NM %            Operating income in 2012 was $565 million, compared to a $384 million operating loss in 2011. The increase in operating income reflected lower catastrophe losses and the impact of underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection, partially offset by higher expenses. Expenses increased primarily as a result of higher acquisition costs and the items described above. Catastrophe losses in 2012 were $76 million, compared with $1.2 billion in 2011. Net prior year adverse reserve development was $48 million in 2012, compared with net prior year favorable reserve development of $17 million in 2011.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 103      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Commercial Insurance Net Premiums Written   In 2012, Commercial Insurance continued to concentrate on growing higher value business. The decline in net premiums written was primarily due to the Casualty line of business. This is consistent with Chartis' business strategy to improve pricing and loss ratios and to non-renew business that does not meet Chartis' internal performance or operating targets. Retentions are in line with management's expectations based on the execution of these strategic initiatives.  The following table presents Commercial Insurance net premiums written by major line of business:                                Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   Percent of Total   2011   Percent of Total   Percentage Change            Casualty    $ 2,352      45 %  $ 2,731      48 %    (14 )%    Property      971      19      1,015      18      (4 )    Specialty      991      19      956      16      4      Financial lines      909      17      1,022      18      (11 )          Total net premiums written    $ 5,223      100 %  $ 5,724      100 %    (9 )%            Commercial Insurance business is transacted in most major foreign currencies. The primary currencies impacting foreign exchange are the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen.  The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Commercial Insurance net premiums written:                    Three Months Ended March 31,   2012 vs. 2011            Decrease in original currency*      (8.5 )%    Foreign exchange effect      (0.1 )          Decrease as reported in U.S. dollars      (8.6 )%             * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.     •Casualty net premiums written decreased primarily due to the continuation of Chartis' strategic initiatives related to improved risk selection and rate increases. The continuation of the restructuring of the loss sensitive book of business resulted in a reduction of net premiums written of $147 million in 2012. Further, management continued to emphasize higher value lines, while taking corrective action in lines that do not meet internal performance targets, including U.S. workers' compensation and European primary casualty. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased by 13.6 percent.  •Property net premiums written decreased primarily because 2011 reflected the benefit of $38 million from the cancellation of a quota share reinsurance treaty, as Chartis continued re-evaluating its reinsurance strategies. The remainder of the decrease is related to the execution of strategic initiatives to improve account risk selection and terms and conditions as well as reductions in catastrophe exposed business in the U.S. The catastrophe-exposed business retained in the U.S. and the Asia Pacific region benefited from significant rate increases. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased by 4.5 percent.  •Specialty net premiums written increased due to a shift in business mix towards higher value products, especially in aerospace and trade credit lines. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, net premiums written growth was 4.3 percent.  •Financial Lines net premiums written decreased because 2011 benefited from a multi-year Errors and Omissions policy that produced net premiums written of $148 million. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased by 10.5 percent.   104 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

Foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on net premiums written.   Asia Pacific net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased slightly, by 0.5 percent. Rate improvement in catastrophe exposed business was offset by actions to maintain underwriting discipline.   EMEA net premiums written decreased due to efforts to maintain underwriting discipline, particularly in the Casualty line. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased by 7.3 percent.   Commercial Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table summarizes the Commercial Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development and premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts on the consolidated loss and combined ratios:                          Three Months Ended March 31,   2012   2011   Increase (Decrease)            Loss ratio      74.1      98.6      (24.5 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (1.4 )    (23.3 )    21.9      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.9 )    0.2      (1.1 )          Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted      71.8      75.5      (3.7 )          Expense ratio      29.3      23.6      5.7            Combined ratio      103.4      122.2      (18.8 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (1.4 )    (23.3 )    21.9      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.9 )    0.2      (1.1 )          Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted      101.1      99.1      2.0             The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Commercial Insurance:                       Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011            Prior year adverse loss development, net of reinsurance    $ 54    $ 20      Returned (additional) premium on loss-sensitive business      (6 )    (37 )          Net prior year adverse (favorable) loss development    $ 48    $ (17 )            Loss Ratios   The loss ratio improved in 2012 primarily due to the effect of catastrophes in the prior year. The improvement in accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reflects the results of the execution of the strategic initiatives on Commercial Insurance lines of businesses. The Specialty line benefited from a change in business mix and rate increases. Enhanced risk selection improved loss ratios for the Property line. Partially offsetting these benefits, the  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 105      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by approximately 1.0 point due to a provision for a reinsurance recoverable dispute within the Specialty Line.   Catastrophes in 2012 were $76 million, primarily due to tornadoes in Alabama during January 2012 and the late winter storms in the U.S. Midwest. This compares to $1.2 billion in 2011, primarily related to the Tohoku Catastrophe and the earthquakes in New Zealand.   Expense Ratios   The expense ratio increased in the current period by 5.7 points, primarily due to additional bad debt allowance of approximately $56 million, compared to a reduction in 2011 of approximately $37 million. This contributed approximately 1.8 points to the expense ratio increase. In addition, the expense ratio increased by approximately 3.0 points due to higher acquisition costs primarily as a result of change in business mix. The remainder of the expense ratio increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs.       Consumer Insurance    Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Consumer product lines are distributed through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet. Consumer Insurance products are categorized into two major lines of business:    •Accident & Health: Includes individual and group voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accidental and supplemental health products, including accidental death and disability, accidental medical reimbursement, hospital indemnity and medical excess for individual, employees, associations and other organizations. It also includes a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers, including trip cancellation, trip interruption, lost baggage, travel assistance and concierge services. In addition, life products offered through Fuji are included in A&H.   •Personal Lines: Includes automobile, homeowners and extended warranty insurance. It also includes coverages for high net worth individuals (offered through the Chartis Private Client Group) including umbrella, yacht and fine art, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection.    Growing higher margin Consumer Insurance business continues to be a key Chartis strategy. The Consumer Insurance lines of business experienced positive growth in 2012. Management continued to emphasize the growth of the direct marketing channel. Although the direct marketing channel requires significant initial investment, it enables the establishment of customer relationships that can be repeatedly leveraged in the future.   Consumer Insurance Results  The following table presents Consumer Insurance results:                          Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Underwriting results:                        Net premiums written    $ 3,597    $ 3,417      5 %    Increase in unearned premiums      (101 )    (71 )    (42 )          Net premiums earned      3,496      3,346      4      Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred      2,030      2,497      (19 )    Underwriting expenses      1,348      1,192      13            Underwriting profit (loss)      118      (343 )    NM            Net investment income      116      88      32            Operating income (loss)    $ 234    $ (255 )    NM %           106 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Operating income in 2012 was $234 million, compared to a $255 million operating loss in 2011, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and the effect of rate increases and underwriting improvements related to enhanced risk selection and portfolio management, partially offset by higher expenses. Expenses increased primarily as a result of a decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities arising from the Fuji acquisition and change in mix of business to more profitable lines with higher acquisition costs. Catastrophe losses in 2012 were $4 million, compared with $489 million in 2011. Net prior year favorable development was $14 million in 2012, compared with negligible net prior year development in 2011.   Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written   The Consumer Insurance business continued to grow its net premiums written and continued to build momentum towards future growth through its multiple distribution channels, and special focus on the growth economy nations. Consumer Insurance is well-diversified across the major lines of business and has global franchises.   The proportion of net premiums written between A&H and Personal Lines was relatively constant year-over-year. Each of the lines of business exhibited positive growth: A&H grew by approximately 5.0 percent and Personal lines grew by approximately 6.0 percent. Management continued to emphasize the growth of the direct marketing channel, which accounts for 15 percent of overall net premiums written. Total global direct marketing spending outside the Americas region has increased by approximately 21 percent from 2011. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, total Consumer Insurance net premiums written growth was 2.9 percent.  The following table presents Consumer Insurance net premiums written by major line of business:                                Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   Percent of Total   2011   Percent of Total   Percentage Change            Accident & Health    $ 1,806      50 %  $ 1,724      50 %    5 %    Personal      1,791      50      1,693      50      6            Total net premiums written    $ 3,597      100 %  $ 3,417      100 %    5 %            Consumer Insurance business is transacted in most major foreign currencies. The primary currencies impacting foreign exchange are the Japanese Yen, British Pound and Euro.  The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Consumer Insurance net premiums written:                    Three Months Ended March 31,   2012 vs. 2011            Increase in original currency*      2.9 %    Foreign exchange effect      2.3            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars      5.2 %             * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.   A&H net premiums written increased due to the implementation of the U.S. group benefits strategy with American General, direct marketing programs in Japan, and growth in individual personal accident insurance in China. This was slightly offset by a portfolio adjustment effort to maintain underwriting discipline, particularly in voluntary personal accident insurance. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, net premiums written growth was 3.4 percent.   Personal Lines net premiums written increased primarily due to the execution of Chartis' strategic initiative to grow higher margin lines of business including warranty business and personal property, both of which grew faster than automobile business. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, net premiums written growth was 2.4 percent.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 107      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. The following table presents Consumer Insurance net premiums written by region:                                Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   Percent of Total   2011   Percent of Total   Percentage Change            Americas    $ 1,024      29 %  $ 911      27 %    12 %    Asia Pacific      2,021      56      1,917      56      5      EMEA      552      15      589      17      (6 )          Total net premiums written    $ 3,597      100 %  $ 3,417      100 %    5 %            Americas net premiums written increased primarily due to U.S. personal accident business for associations, the aforementioned U.S. group benefits strategy, personal property and warranty growth. This growth was partially offset by the reduction in certain business which did not meet internal performance targets. Overall, direct marketing accounts for 7 percent of net premiums written for the region. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written grew 13.2 percent.   Asia Pacific net premiums written increased as a result of leveraging the acquisition of Fuji to continue expansion of new production across its distribution channels and customer base. The expansion in Asia Pacific countries, outside of Japan, continued, supported by growth in direct marketing activities and growth in individual personal accident insurance in China. Overall, direct marketing accounts for 17 percent of net premiums written for the region. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written grew 1.2 percent.   EMEA net premiums written decreased as a result of underwriting discipline and rate strengthening. Management continues to build its direct marketing programs, which account for 23 percent of the region's net premiums written. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written declined 1.7 percent.   Consumer Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table summarizes the Consumer Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development and premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts on the consolidated loss and combined ratios:                          Three Months Ended March 31,   2012   2011   Increase (Decrease)            Loss ratio      58.1      74.6      (16.5 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (0.1 )    (14.6 )    14.5      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      0.4      -      0.4            Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted      58.4      60.0      (1.6 )          Expense ratio      38.6      35.6      3.0            Combined ratio      96.7      110.2      (13.5 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (0.1 )    (14.6 )    14.5      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      0.4      -      0.4            Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted      97.0      95.6      1.4              Loss Ratios   The Consumer Insurance loss ratio improved primarily due to fewer catastrophe losses and a benefit from refinements to certain actuarial assumptions within the A&H line of business. Management continues to focus on further improving the loss performance of the portfolio by taking underwriting actions, where necessary, to meet internal performance or operating targets. Consumer Insurance recorded net prior year favorable loss development of $14 million, primarily related to the Tohoku Catastrophe, which compares to negligible net prior year loss development in 2011.  108 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Expense Ratios   The expense ratio increased in the current period by 3.0 points primarily due to the decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities from the acquisition of Fuji, coupled with increased acquisition and operating expenses to grow key lines of business across a number of geographic areas.       Chartis Other    Chartis Other consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including Excess Workers' Compensation, written on a stand-alone basis, and Asbestos and environmental products (1986 and prior), certain Chartis expenses relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income and realized capital gains and losses.

Therefore, underwriting ratios are not presented for Chartis Other.   Substantially all premiums relate to the Excess Workers' Compensation line of business. During 2011, as part of its ongoing initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines, Chartis determined to cease writing Excess Workers' Compensation business on a stand-alone basis. This line of business is subject to premium audits (upon the expiration of the underlying policy) and as a result, Chartis Other will reflect the effects of premium audit activity through subsequent years.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  The current year reflects prior year development, primarily from Environmental (1986 and prior), and change in the reserve discount. In the prior year, claims and claim adjustment expenses primarily included adverse prior year development on global asbestos-related claims, as well as current accident year losses in the Excess Workers' compensation line of business.   Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense   The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for Chartis as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in AIG's Other operations category.  The following table presents the components of AIG's gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a U.S. statutory basis*:                        (in millions)   March 31, 2012   December 31, 2011            Other liability occurrence    $ 22,037    $ 22,526      International      18,096      17,726      Workers' compensation      17,755      17,420      Other liability claims made      11,433      11,216      Property      4,855      6,165      Auto liability      3,020      3,081      Mortgage guaranty credit      2,627      3,046      Products liability      2,048      2,416      Accident and health      1,666      1,553      Medical malpractice      1,656      1,690      Commercial multiple peril      1,202      1,134      Aircraft      978      1,020      Fidelity/surety      780      786      Other      1,632      1,366            Total    $ 89,785    $ 91,145               * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.   AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  110 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 - 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain other asbestos business that was written by Chartis is discounted based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business. The discount consists of the following: $777 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in the domestic operations of Chartis and $2.32 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in the domestic operations of Chartis; and $69 million — non-tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.       Quarterly Reserving Process    AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of March 31, 2012. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of March 31, 2012. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.   In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. AIG conducted reserve analyses in 2012 to determine the loss development from prior accident years. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, changes in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services), underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling practices.

The net favorable development in 2011 was further enhanced by additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $37 million.   As noted in the tables above, Chartis experienced adverse development in 2012, primarily in its Excess casualty and Environmental lines, that was largely offset by net favorable development in reserves for natural catastrophes.   The development in the Excess casualty line was primarily related to higher than expected claims emergence in general liability classes, as well as a portfolio that provided general liability coverage to public entities, which is in runoff.   The development in the Environmental line was primarily attributable to claims increases in three major categories:   •Site liability coverage for clean-up costs and other property and liability exposures;   •Coverage for manufacturers and distributors whose raw materials, products or industrial processes present a significant environmental exposure; and •Policies that provide an enhanced general liability product designed specifically to meet the needs of environmental consultants and contractors.    The net favorable development in the current quarter on reserves for natural catastrophes, primarily the Tohoku Catastrophe, was due to lower than expected contingent business interruption claims on local Japan commercial accounts and favorable development in the energy sector.   See Chartis Results herein and Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.       Asbestos and Environmental Reserves    The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.   As described more fully in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis performed annually. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount and a moderate adjustment to the environmental gross and net reserves are reflected in the table below.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, Chartis also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $236 million gross and $166 million net reserves as of March 31, 2012. Similar amounts were held at December 31, 2011.

All of these accounts were fully reserved at the account level and included adequate reserves for those underlying individual claims that contributed to the actual losses. These individual claim closings, therefore, had no impact on Chartis' environmental reserves.   Survival Ratios — Asbestos and Environmental   The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at March 31, 2012 and 2011. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments.   Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.  The following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                 2012    2011      Three Months Ended March 31,   Gross   Net   Gross   Net*            Survival ratios:                              Asbestos      9.1      9.5      9.0      10.0      Environmental      3.5      3.6      3.2      3.0      Combined      8.5      8.7      8.4      8.9               * Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis on historical reserve excluding the effects of the NICO cession.

SunAmerica reported an increase in operating income in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting higher net investment income, lower DAC amortization and lower policyholder benefit expense in SunAmerica's variable annuity business due to stronger equity market conditions, and $43 million of additional DAC amortization in 2011 as a result of an unlocking. These increases were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2012.   The increase in net investment income reflected an increase in base yields of 46 basis points, due to the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011. Together with continued active crediting rate management, this resulted in higher base spreads across all of SunAmerica's spread-based annuity businesses. In addition to the increase from reinvestment, net investment income compared to the same quarter of 2011 reflected the following items:   •$131 million decrease in income from private equity funds and hedge funds due to lower returns;   •$22 million decrease in call and tender income; and  •Income from fair value gain on ML II of $246 million in the first quarter of 2012 was comparable to $251 million in the first quarter of 2011. In March 2012, SunAmerica received a distribution of $1.6 billion from the sale by the FRBNY of the securities held by ML II, which resulted in the full liquidation by the FRBNY of this investment.    In a weak equity market, SunAmerica increases policyholder benefit reserves to recognize the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance for certain guaranteed benefits features of variable annuities. DAC related to these products may also be adjusted through amortization expense to reflect updates of future estimated gross profits due to changes in equity market assumptions. The effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets on the estimated gross profits of variable products is mitigated in part through the use of a reversion to mean methodology for estimating future gross profits. Under this methodology, SunAmerica assumes a long-term growth rate for the assets backing these liabilities, which factors in potential short-term fluctuations in the financial markets, and if the long-term growth rate assumption is deemed to be unreasonable in light of the current market conditions, the long-term growth rate assumption is revised upward or downward to reflect the revised estimate. SunAmerica did not make any changes to its long-term growth rate assumptions in 2011 or 2012. The effect of positive equity market performance resulted in $52 million lower DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses in 2012 compared to 2011.   Pre-tax income for SunAmerica included a $246 million increase in net realized capital losses, due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and higher fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives due to declining credit spreads, partially offset by higher gains from the sale of investments.   The sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition of $87 million in the first quarter of 2012, which was reported as a component of Benefit of DAC, VOBA, SIA and adjustments to reserves related to net realized capital losses. These sales effectively shifted some future investment margins to current period realized gains, ultimately resulting in projected future losses in conjunction with a review of other key assumptions that have changed since issuance of the supported products, including expected investment returns and mortality. As part of a program to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards, additional sales of such securities to generate capital gains are planned in 2012.   SunAmerica has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded policy derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts, caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. SunAmerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a significant portion of the interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, SunAmerica began purchasing U.S. Treasury notes as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce this interest rate exposure. SunAmerica has elected to account for these securities at fair value. As a result of increases in interest rates during the first three months of 2012, the fair value of these securities, net of financing costs, declined by $19 million.

Individual fixed annuity deposits declined due to the low interest rate environment as consumers are more reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively lower crediting rates currently offered. Group retirement deposits (which include deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) increased primarily due to higher levels of individual rollover deposits in 2012. SunAmerica expects that the low interest rate environment will begin to impact group retirement deposits, resulting in lower levels of deposits into fixed options over the course of 2012. Individual variable annuity deposits increased due to competitive product enhancements and reinstatements during the last year at a number of key broker-dealers. Deposits from life insurance products increased in 2012 but were more than offset by declines in deferred annuities sold through life insurance distribution channels. Retail mutual fund annual sales growth was driven by SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.'s product offerings.   SunAmerica grew new sales of mortality based life insurance products in the first quarter of 2012 by continuing to strengthen the core retail independent distribution channel and continuing to focus on career agent and direct-to-consumer distribution. Retail life sales increased 7 percent compared to the first quarter of 2011, due in part to strong sales through Matrix Direct, SunAmerica's direct-to-consumer platform, particularly of SunAmerica's proprietary term life policies.  118 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Overall net flows declined due to lower fixed annuity deposits resulting from the low interest rate environment. However, surrender rates for individual fixed annuities also decreased in 2012 due to the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. Net flows improved in 2012 for individual variable annuities and group retirement products due to both the significant increase in deposits and favorable surrender experience. Net flows improved in 2012 for retail mutual funds due to increased deposits.

See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (b)Net of benefit of DAC and VOBA related to net realized capital losses.   As SunAmerica operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. See Note 2(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on DAC and VOBA recoverability.   Aircraft Leasing Operations   AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines (and, since the date of its acquisition by ILFC, AeroTurbine). Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.  120 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

These increases were offset by lower impairment charges.   Other Operations   AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations, Global Capital Markets operations, Direct Investment book, Retained Interests and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).   AIG's Other operations include the following:   •Mortgage Guaranty — UGC subsidiaries issue residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one-to four-family residences.   •Global Capital Markets — consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties. The remaining AIGFP portfolio is managed opportunistically, consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.  •Direct Investment book — includes results for the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 121      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Retained Interests — includes fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA ordinary shares, the retained interest in ML III, and, prior to their sale on March 8, 2011, the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities that were received as consideration from the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO, and such sale, the ALICO Sale).  •Corporate & Other — consists primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate-level net realized capital gains and losses, and certain litigation-related charges and credits.

Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax results remained constant due to:   •a decline in first lien earned premiums reflecting premium refunds of $19 million due to the rescissions arising from the claims requests sent to lenders during the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing into the first quarter of 2012, as discussed in Outlook herein, in addition to the declining persistency on the 2008 and prior policy years;  •a decline in earned premiums on second-lien, private student loan and international businesses, all of which were placed into runoff during 2008; and  •an increase in underwriting expenses driven primarily by an increase in underwriting, sales and product initiatives. All of these activities supported an increase in new insurance written for the quarter.   These decreases were offset by:   •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $48 million, primarily in first-lien business, reflecting lower levels of newly reported delinquencies and increased denied and rescinded claims partially offset by lower favorable loss development of $14 million in 2012. Favorable development arising from the claims requests sent to lenders mentioned above was $36 million.    New insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, was approximately $6 billion and $3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   Risk-in-Force  The following table presents risk in force and delinquency ratio information for Mortgage Guaranty domestic business:                       At March 31, (dollars in billions)   2012   2011            Domestic first-lien:                  Risk in force    $ 25.9    $ 24.9      60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a)      11.4 %    15.2 %    Domestic second-lien:                  Risk in force(b)    $ 1.4    $ 1.8               (a) Based on number of policies. (b)Represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions, which will expire as the loan balances are repaid.       Global Capital Markets Operations    Global Capital Markets' pre-tax income decreased in 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior CDS portfolio and net credit valuation adjustment losses on the AIGFP derivative assets and liabilities in 2012 compared to net gains in 2011. For the three month period ended March 31, 2012, an unrealized market valuation gain on the super senior CDS portfolio of $140 million was recognized compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $323 million in 2011. The reduction in gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price movements and amortization within the CDS portfolio. For the three month period ended March 31, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment loss on AIGFP's derivative assets and liabilities of $22 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $28 million in 2011 due to a tightening of AIG's credit spreads relative to those of its counterparties.   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities herein for a discussion of the super senior CDS portfolio.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 123                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.       Direct Investment Book Results    The Direct Investment book's pre-tax income decreased in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to net credit valuation adjustment losses on the AIGFP non-derivative assets and liabilities in 2012 compared to net gains in 2011, partially offset by realized capital gains in 2012. For the three month period ended March 31, 2012, the Direct Investment book recognized a net credit valuation adjustment loss on the AIGFP non-derivative assets and liabilities of $191 million compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $300 million in 2011 due to the adverse impact of tightening of AIG's credit spreads on DIB liabilities carried at fair value. The net credit valuation adjustment effect was partially offset by realized capital gains of $426 million on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P. in 2012.  The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the AIGFP non-derivative assets and liabilities (excluding intercompany transactions):                         (in millions)                       Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       Three Months Ended March 31, 2012                      Bond trading securities    $ 354    Notes and bonds payable    $ (201 )    Loans and other assets      13    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      (242 )              Guaranteed Investment Agreements (GIAs)      (90 )              Other liabilities      (25 )              Increase in assets    $ 367    Increase in liabilities    $ (558 )              Net pre-tax decrease to Other income    $ (191 )                    Three Months Ended March 31, 2011                      Bond trading securities   $ 325    Notes and bonds payable   $ (18 )    Loans and other assets     16    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     (30 )              GIAs     9                Other liabilities     (2 )              Increase in assets   $ 341    Increase in liabilities   $ (41 )              Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 300                              Retained Interests    Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities   On March 7, 2012, AIG sold 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA and recognized a gain of $0.6 billion. AIG's percentage of AIA ordinary shares decreased from approximately 33 percent to approximately 19 percent as a result of this sale. The fair value of AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities increased $1.2 billion during the quarter ended March 31, 2012.   Change in Fair Value of ML III   The gain attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was generally due to tightening credit spreads.   Change in Fair Value of the MetLife Securities Prior to Sale   AIG recognized a loss in 2011, representing the decline in the securities' value, due to market conditions, from December 31, 2010 through the date of their sale in the first quarter of 2011.  124 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Corporate & Other    Corporate & Other reported a decline in pre-tax losses in the three months ended March 31, 2012 primarily reflecting the following:   •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and   •a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in connection with the transactions to recapitalize AIG (the Recapitalization), primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility recorded in 2011.    Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in other corporate expenses due to ongoing corporate initiatives, higher compensation expense, equity losses on real estate investments due to property impairment and adverse foreign exchange rate movements.        CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) The following table presents AIG's consolidated comprehensive income (loss):                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011   Percentage Change            Net income    $ 3,449    $ 1,501      130 %          Change in unrealized appreciation of investments      2,711      577      370      Change in deferred acquisition costs adjustment and other      (379 )    (158 )    (140 )    Change in future policy benefits      34      -      NM      Change in foreign currency translation adjustments      87      649      (87 )    Change in net derivative gains (losses) arising from cash flow hedging activities      4      18      (78 )    Change in retirement plan liabilities adjustment      29      2      NM      Change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations      -      (2,334 )    NM      Deferred tax asset (liability)      (761 )    466      NM            Other comprehensive income (loss)      1,725      (780 )    NM            Comprehensive income      5,174      721      NM            Total comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests      246      240      3            Comprehensive income attributable to AIG    $ 4,928    $ 481      NM %            Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments   The $2.7 billion increase for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and significant spread tightening partially offset by higher U.S. treasury rates.   The change for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was due to appreciation in bonds available for sale and valuations on cost method partnerships. The bond appreciation was driven by spreads narrowing, which more than offset higher U.S. treasury rates. The increase in cost method partnerships was attributable to positive equity market performance.   Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other   DAC for investment-oriented products adjusted for changes in estimated gross profits that result from changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale. Because fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to DAC equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in these adjustments, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 125      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. charged directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The change in deferred acquisition costs in 2012 is primarily the result of increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest-sensitive products.   Change in Future Policy Benefits   The adjustment to policyholder benefits reserves in 2012 is due to loss reserve recognition resulting from sales of securities in unrealized gain positions.   Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments   Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased principally as a result of the sale of Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. in the third quarter of 2011.   Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities   The decline primarily reflects the gradual run-off of the cash flow hedge portfolio, partially offset by a decline in the interest rate environment.   Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment   The change is due to the fluctuation in exchange rates in effect for the first quarter 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011 and the amortization of a larger net actuarial loss balance that existed at year-end 2011. The larger net actuarial loss balance at year-end 2011 was the result of lower discount rates used to value the U.S. plans at year-end 2011 compared to year-end 2010.   Divestitures and Deconsolidations   The change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations in 2011 primarily reflects the derecognition of all items in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of sale for AIG Star and AIG Edison.   Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income   For the three-months ended March 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Income was 30.6 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to the effects of foreign operations.   For the three-months ended March 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Loss was 37.4 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to the AIG Star and AIG Edison dispositions, changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries and the effects of foreign operations.        CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY       OVERVIEW  AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are short-term investments and borrowing availability under syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities. In addition, subject to market conditions, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs, which include the payment of maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries.   Highlights of actions taken during the three months ended March 31, 2012 that affected capital resources and liquidity include:   •AIG Purchase of Shares — share repurchases of AIG Common Stock of approximately $3.0 billion in the Offering;   126 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Pay down of AIA SPV Preferred Interests — the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury were paid down in full using both existing funds and the proceeds from the following sources:     •Sale of 1.72 billion in AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion;   •Distributions of approximately $1.6 billion to AIG from the FRBNY's final disposition of ML II securities; and   •Use of existing funds allocated to the MIP.   •Dividends from Subsidiaries — approximately $2.6 billion paid to AIG Parent from subsidiaries, including $1.0 billion in non-cash dividends from Chartis and $1.6 billion in note repayments from SunAmerica funded by payments of dividends from their subsidiaries;  •AIG Senior Notes Offering — A registered public offering of $750 million 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion 3.800% Notes Due 2017 for the MIP. The proceeds were used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP;  •ILFC Debt Offerings — $2.4 billion of secured and unsecured financings; and  •Debt Reduction — repayment of total debt of $4.4 billion, which includes repayments of $1.3 billion by AIG Parent.    See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Sources of Liquidity herein for further discussion.        LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY MANAGEMENT  AIG maintains a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess AIG's aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIG's existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two-year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks.   AIG's insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERM's stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation to determine the liquidity required of AIG Parent to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required under stressed scenarios for non-insurance operations, including the Global Capital Markets derivatives portfolio, the Direct Investment book and ILFC.   AIG's consolidated risk target is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer such that AIG Parent's liquidity requirements under the ERM stress scenarios do not exceed 80 percent of AIG Parent's overall liquidity sources over the specified two-year horizon. If the 80 percent minimum threshold is projected to be breached over this defined time horizon, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the target threshold, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions.   AIG has in place unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain domestic Chartis and SunAmerica insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. AIG has also entered into and expects to enter into additional CMAs with certain other Chartis insurance companies as needed in 2012. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Chartis, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — SunAmerica, below.

Dividend Restrictions   See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of potential restrictions on payments of dividends to common shareholders.   See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG and its subsidiaries.        ANALYSIS OF SOURCES AND USES OF CASH The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                        Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2012   2011            Summary:                  Net cash used in operating activities    $ (111 )  $ (5,312 )    Net cash provided by investing activities      10,186      39,617      Net cash used in financing activities      (10,232 )    (34,485 )    Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      (2 )    23            Decrease in cash      (159 )    (157 )    Cash at beginning of year      1,474      1,558      Change in cash of businesses held for sale      -      400            Cash at end of period    $ 1,315    $ 1,801              Operating Cash Flow Activities   Interest payments totaled $0.9 billion and $5.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively.   Cash used in Chartis operating activities of $0.2 billion was consistent for 2012 and 2011. Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of Chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. The decline in 2012 net premiums written is consistent with Chartis' business strategy to decline renewals on business that does not meet Chartis' internal performance or operating targets. During 2011, increases in losses incurred were primarily related to catastrophe losses, including the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and earthquakes in New Zealand.   Cash provided by operating activities of $0.1 billion by SunAmerica was consistent for 2012 and 2011, while Aircraft Leasing generated cash from operating activities of $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively. These cash flows reflected operating performance that was generally consistent for SunAmerica and Aircraft Leasing in both periods.   Investing Cash Flow Activities   Net cash provided by investing activities in 2012 includes the following events:   •approximately $1.6 billion in distributions from the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II; and   •approximately $6.0 billion in gross proceeds from the sale of 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares.    Net cash provided by investing activities for 2011 mainly resulted from the deployment of restricted cash generated from the AIA initial public offering and the disposition of MetLife securities received in the ALICO sale.  128 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Financing Cash Flow Activities   Net cash used in financing activities during 2012 includes the following activities:   •$8.6 billion pay down of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV preferred interests;   •$3.0 billion payment for the purchase of 103 million shares of AIG Common Stock.   •repayments of $1.2 billion of DIB long-term debt and $2.3 billion of Aircraft Leasing long-term debt; and  •issuances of $2.0 billion of AIG debt to fund the MIP and $2.4 billion of secured and unsecured financings by Aircraft Leasing.    Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 primarily resulted from the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $9.1 billion partial repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and the preferred interests in AM Holdings LLC (the ALICO SPV) in connection with the Recapitalization and use of proceeds received from the sales of foreign life insurance entities in 2011, all within Other operations.        LIQUIDITY OF PARENT AND SUBSIDIARIES  AIG Parent   In March 2012, AIG paid down the remaining liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and redeemed the Department of the Treasury's preferred participating return rights under the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV limited liability company agreements.   As a result of these payments, the equity interests in ILFC, the ordinary shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV, the common equity interest in the AIA SPV held by AIG, AIG's interests in ML III, and the $1.6 billion in cash held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife were released as security supporting the repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests.   On March 13, 2012, the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. The Department of the Treasury sold approximately 207 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of $6.0 billion. AIG purchased $3.0 billion of AIG Common Stock in the Offering at the public offering price of $29 per share.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.   AIG has established and maintains substantial actual and contingent liquidity.  The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity:                    (In millions)   As of March 31, 2012            Cash and short-term investments(a)    $ 8,193      Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities(b)      3,200      Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facilities(c)      1,000            Total AIG Parent liquidity sources    $ 12,393               (a) Includes reverse repurchase agreements totaling $5.8 billion used to reduce unsecured exposures. (b)For additional information relating to the syndicated bank credit facilities, see Credit Facilities below. (c)For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facilities, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 129                Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   Sources of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. In addition, as noted above, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs. In the first three months of 2012, AIG Parent:   •collected $1.7 billion in cash payments from subsidiaries, including $1.6 billion in note repayments from SunAmerica funded by payments of dividends from subsidiaries representing proceeds from the FRBNY's sale of ML II assets;  •collected approximately $1 billion in dividends from Chartis in the form of municipal bonds;   •issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP (described more fully in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Other Operations — Direct Investment Book below); and •sold 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion, which proceeds were utilized to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests.    Uses of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In the first three months of 2012, AIG Parent:   •retired $1.3 billion of debt, including $1.2 billion of MIP obligations, and made interest payments totaling $398 million;  •purchased approximately 103 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the Offering for approximately $3.0 billion;  •utilized $1.6 billion in proceeds from the disposition of ML II assets to reduce the liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and redeem the Department of the Treasury's preferred participating return rights in the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV;  •fully paid down the remaining liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests;   •paid $550 million as a result of final approval of a settlement under the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation; and •made $41 million in net subsidiary capital contributions.    AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. No assurance can be given, however, that AIG's cash needs will not exceed its projected liquidity. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity, or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   Chartis   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Chartis subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $6.7 billion as of March 31, 2012. Further, Chartis businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including  130 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which Chartis could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient.   One or more large catastrophes may require AIG to provide support to the affected Chartis operations. In addition, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the relevant subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations, and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of Chartis subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Chartis operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.   In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) guidelines and determined based on the companies' statutory financial statements). As a result, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies falls below the specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, AIG will contribute cash or other instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these Chartis insurance companies in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate. In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, subject to board approval, the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or (ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law. The CMAs do not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board or regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMAs would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum percentage was 425 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2011, AIG received a total of approximately $1.3 billion in dividends from Chartis and made no contributions to Chartis under the CMAs.   In February 2012, AIG, Chartis and certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies entered into a new, single CMA, which replaces the CMAs entered into in February 2011. The new CMA is structured similarly to the CMAs that it replaces, except that under the new CMA, the total adjusted capital and total authorized control level RBC of these Chartis insurance companies are measured as a group (the Fleet) rather than on an individual company basis. As a result, the new CMA provides that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of the Fleet at or above a specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's projected total authorized control level RBC. The initial specified minimum percentage is 350 percent. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $1.0 billion in dividends from Chartis, consisting primarily of municipal bonds, and made no contributions to Chartis under the new CMA.   In March 2012, the National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (NUFI), a Chartis subsidiary, became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. FHLB membership provides participants with access to various services, including access to low-cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage-backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets. These advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes. As of March 31, 2012, NUFI had no advances outstanding under this facility.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 131      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  During September 2011, a $725 million letter of credit facility was put in place, under which Chartis Inc. and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) acted as co-obligors. ACNL, a Chartis subsidiary and member of the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd's), is required to hold capital at Lloyd's, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2012 and 2013 years of account, the entire FAL requirement of $583 million as of March 31, 2011 was satisfied with a letter of credit.   SunAmerica   Management considers the sources of liquidity for SunAmerica subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Management, however, has recently initiated some specific programs intended to provide additional sources of actual and contingent liquidity. The SunAmerica companies continue to maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2012. In the first three months of 2012, SunAmerica provided $1.6 billion of liquidity to AIG Parent through payment of dividends and surplus note interest from insurance subsidiaries. These payments from the insurance companies were funded through a return of capital distribution of the insurance subsidiaries interests in ML II from the FRBNY's sale of the underlying assets.   The most significant potential liquidity requirements of the SunAmerica companies are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of SunAmerica's investment portfolios, AIG believes that normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk. As part of its risk management framework, SunAmerica continues to evaluate and implement programs to enhance its liquidity position and facilitate SunAmerica's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio, including securities lending programs and other secured financings structured to increase liquidity. During 2012, SunAmerica began utilizing securities lending programs. In addition, in 2011, certain SunAmerica insurance companies became members of the FHLBs in their respective districts, primarily as an additional source of liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by the member. As of March 31, 2012, SunAmerica had borrowed $76 million from the FHLBs to confirm its ability to access this source of liquidity.   In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain SunAmerica insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected Company Action Level RBCs. As a result, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies falls below the specified minimum percentage of their respective Company Action Level RBCs, AIG will contribute cash or instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these SunAmerica insurance companies in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate. In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs, subject to board approval, the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or (ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law. The CMAs do not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board or regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMAs would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum percentage was 350 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, which had a specified minimum percentage of 250 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2011, AIG received a total of approximately $1.4 billion in distributions from SunAmerica in the form of note repayments. For the three months  132 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. ended March 31, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $1.6 billion in distributions from SunAmerica in the form of note repayments. AIG made no contributions to SunAmerica under the CMAs in either period. Effective March 30, 2012, the specified minimum percentage increased from 350 percent to 435 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage remained at 250 percent.   Aircraft Leasing   ILFC's sources of liquidity include existing cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, future cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities, debt issuances, and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments. On February 23, 2012, ILFC closed on a $900 million senior secured term loan due in 2017. ILFC used the proceeds from this loan to prepay the $457 million outstanding under its five-year syndicated facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The senior secured term loan is secured primarily by a first priority perfected lien on the equity of certain ILFC subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own a pool of aircraft and related leases.   On March 19, 2012, ILFC issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $750 million of 4.875% Notes due 2015 and $750 million of 5.875% Notes due 2019. Part of the proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to prepay ILFC's $750 million senior secured term loan scheduled to mature in 2015 and the remainder will be used to for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the purchase of aircraft.   On April 12, 2012, ILFC entered into a $550 million secured term loan due in 2016. ILFC used the proceeds from this loan to refinance its $550 million secured term loan that was scheduled to mature in 2016.   On April 23, 2012, ILFC closed on a $203 million senior secured term loan due in 2018. ILFC is using the proceeds from this loan for the acquisition of seven new aircraft which will be delivered in 2012.   See Debt herein for further details on ILFC's revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt.   Other Operations   Mortgage Guaranty   AIG currently expects that its UGC subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. UGC subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $878 million as of March 31, 2012. Further, UGC businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds ($2.9 billion in the aggregate at March 31, 2012), which UGC could monetize in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.   Global Capital Markets   AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties and executes its derivative trades under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of AIG Markets' transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties.   Most of the AIGFP credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs. The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 133      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. AIG estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into AIG's liquidity planning assumptions. AIGFP continues to rely upon AIG Parent to meet most of its collateral and other liquidity requirements in connection with its remaining derivatives portfolio.   Collateral posted by operations included in Global Capital Markets to third parties was $4.6 billion and $5.1 billion at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Collateral obtained by operations included in Global Capital Markets from third parties was $946 million and $1.2 billion at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeds the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.   Direct Investment Book   As of March 31, 2012, management expects the DIB's investments to provide sufficient return to fund the DIB maturing liabilities. The DIB's investment portfolio consists primarily of cash, short term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities and to a lesser extent bank loans, mortgage loans and equity securities. While a significant portion of the DIB's liquidity requirements are supported by existing liquidity sources or maturing investments, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows may require assets to be sold or AIG to access the capital markets to satisfy liquidity requirements. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets if required, proceeds from asset sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount required. Management believes that sufficient liquidity is maintained by the DIB to meet near-term liquidity requirements. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.   In the first quarter of 2012, AIG issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, $750 million of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion of 3.800% Notes Due 2017. The proceeds from the sale of these notes are being used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP and the notes are included within MIP notes payable in the debt outstanding table below. Excess funds allocated to the MIP were used to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests. In exchange, AIG's remaining interest in ML III and the future proceeds from the cash held in escrow to secure indemnities provided to MetLife were allocated to the MIP.   Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $5.1 billion at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.  134 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Aircraft Leasing. Additionally, at March 31, 2012, ILFC had $2.0 billion available under its unsecured three-year revolving credit facility and an additional $154 million available under AeroTurbine's secured revolving credit agreement. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance its existing debt or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations.  •AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt included in the DIB. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold or AIG to access the capital markets to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. At March 31, 2012, all of the debt maturities in the DIB through March 31, 2013 are supported by short-term investments and maturing investments.

CREDIT FACILITIES  AIG relies on credit facilities as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Currently, AIG and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities, including a facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit, summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes and for letter of credit issuance. AIG intends to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. One of the facilities, as noted below, contains a "term-out option" allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. All facilities, except for ILFC's four-year AeroTurbine syndicated credit facility maturing December 2015, are unsecured.

The AIG 4-Year Syndicated Facility provides for $3.0 billion of revolving loans, which includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. As of March 31, 2012, $1.3 billion of letters of credit were outstanding under the letter of credit sublimit within the 4-Year Syndicated Facility, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on the 364-Day and 4-Year facilities from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings.   AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, including covenants relating to AIG's maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth, total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization and total priority debt (defined as debt of AIG's subsidiaries and secured debt of AIG) to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict AIG's access to the facilities and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIG's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   ILFC's three-year credit facility, which became effective January 31, 2011, contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that, among other things, restrict ILFC from entering into secured financing in excess of 30 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets, as defined in the agreement, less $2.0 billion, excluding fixed asset financings. As of April 27, 2012, ILFC would be able to incur an additional $3.3 billion of secured indebtedness under this covenant. Prior to April 16, 2010, ILFC had a $2.5 billion five-year syndicated facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. ILFC subsequently amended and extended the facility to mature in October 2012. ILFC repaid $457 million outstanding under the facility and terminated the facility on February 23, 2012. ILFC is a guarantor for a four-year credit facility entered into by AeroTurbine, a wholly owned subsidiary of ILFC, whose assets are pledged as security for the outstanding amount. In February 2012, ILFC increased AeroTurbine's facility by $95 million to $430 million.        CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY FACILITIES  AIG has access to contingent liquidity facilities of up to $1 billion as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes:   •In 2010, AIG established a $500 million contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG and the counterparty.   •In October 2011, AIG entered into a contingent liquidity facility under which AIG has the right, for a period of one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years from the date any such put option agreement is entered into, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIG's discretion.    AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings.        CREDIT RATINGS  The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short- and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of April 27, 2012. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.  138 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

(c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.   These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   Adverse ratings actions regarding our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require AIGFP to post additional collateral payments pursuant to, and/or permit the termination of, derivative transactions to which AIGFP is a party, which could adversely affect AIG's business, its consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or its liquidity. Credit ratings estimate a company's ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability to that company of financing. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of AIGFP's counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

(b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.2 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of AIG's credit default swaps require AIG to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At March 31, 2012, the fair value derivative liability was $2.5 billion, relating to the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at March 31, 2012, collateral posted with respect to these swaps was $2.1 billion.        OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS      The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                             Amount of Commitment Expiring      March 31, 2012  (in millions)           Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2012   2013 - 2014   2015 - 2016   2017   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                          Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 660   $ 558   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ 102      Standby letters of credit     438     419     15     3     -     1      Guarantees of indebtedness     165     -     -     -     -     165      All other guarantees(b)     488     77     77     158     40     136      Commitments:                                          Investment commitments(c)     2,752     2,390     196     166     -     -      Commitments to extend credit     187     138     48     -     -     1      Letters of credit     26     18     8     -     -     -      Other commercial commitments(d)     902     15     2     -     -     885            Total(e)   $ 5,618   $ 3,615   $ 346   $ 327   $ 40   $ 1,290               (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (b)Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c)Includes commitments to invest in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (d)Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2012 is expected to be approximately $70 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (e)Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  140 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   Securities Financing   The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.   Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities   While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        INVESTMENTS       INVESTMENT STRATEGIES  AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.   •In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the Direct Investment book, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration.  •Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in Chartis historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of Chartis, the domestic property and casualty companies continue to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  •Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Chartis companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.        INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS  At March 31, 2012, approximately 88 percent of AIG's fixed maturity securities were held by domestic entities. Approximately 19 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 14 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2012, approximately 22 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 3 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 50 percent of  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. the foreign entities, fixed maturity securities portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.   The equity and credit markets experienced positive returns in the first quarter of 2012. Each sector of the domestic equity markets achieved positive returns, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 returning 8 percent, 12 percent, and 19 percent, respectively. A 33 basis point increase in ten year U.S. Treasury rates was more than offset by significant spread narrowing. Economic events such as a lower U.S. unemployment rate, European Central Bank liquidity injections of approximately $1.1 trillion, and an agreement on the Greek sovereign debt issue helped reduce market uncertainty. Significant areas of concern remain, including Middle East tensions contributing to an increase of approximately 50 percent in the price of oil, over the past six months, and credit rating agencies continuing to issue and warn of possible downgrades. The FRBNY's operation Twist is expected to end in June 2012, which could put pressure on long term rates.   An overview of investment activities during 2012 is provided below:   Asset Composition    •New investment purchases were made using proceeds from sales and maturities of securities, paydowns on structured securities, and cash flow from operations and investments. Amounts purchased were lower than in 2011 when the insurance operations had more to invest due to a higher level of gain realization and cash and short term investment that was redeployed throughout 2011. As a result, the cash and short term investment balance is back to pre crisis levels.  •For the first quarter of 2012, Chartis' tax exempt municipal bonds sales slowed compared to prior quarters throughout 2011.  •Corporate debt securities represented the largest new investment category.   •Risk weighted opportunistic investments in RMBS and other structured securities continued to be made to improve yields and increase net investment income.  •The low rate environment continues to put downward pressure on SunAmerica's yields as cash flows are reinvested at generally lower rates. Base yields at Chartis benefited from redeployment activities in 2011 and the fact that blended new money rates in the Chartis portfolio were higher than the rates on the investments that were sold, matured or were called.    Net investment income and unrealized and realized gains and losses are discussed under Consolidated Results.   With respect to AIG's fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 97 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) AIG's equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity investments that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or AIG, and represents primarily AIG's interest in ML III.

Although the market value of CMBS holdings has remained stable during the first quarter of 2012, the portfolio continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.

AIA INVESTMENT  On March 7, 2012, AIG sold 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA for gross cash proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion (the AIA Sale). As a result of the sale, AIG's retained interest in AIA decreased from approximately 33 percent to approximately 19 percent. At March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the carrying value of AIG's retained interest in AIA was $8.2 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, which was recorded in Other invested assets and accounted for under the fair value option.   The value of the AIA ordinary shares will fluctuate until their ultimate disposition by AIG. The value of these shares will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of AIA. An agreement with the underwriters for the AIA Sale precludes AIG from entering into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of its remaining interest in AIA.

Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.  152 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 related to:   •issuer-specific credit events;  •securities for which AIG has changed its intent from hold to sell;  •declines due to foreign exchange rates;  •certain structured securities;  •other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts; and  •securities that experienced severe market valuation declines.    With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.10 percent and 0.03 percent of Total equity in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $218 million and $103 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(c) For bonds, represents amortized cost.  (d) The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC. (e)Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.    For the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $2.4 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of March 31, 2012, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for 12 months or more consisted of the unrealized loss of $257 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 21 securities with an amortized cost of $44 million and a net unrealized loss of $26 million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate-related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive.   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.   See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of AIG's investment portfolio.        ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT       OVERVIEW  Risk management is a key element of AIG's approach to corporate governance. AIG has an integrated process for managing risks throughout the organization. The Board has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. AIG's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of AIG's major business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view on the firm's major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM.   For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Enterprise Risk Management in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.        CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (fair value changes and potential future exposure), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties, commercial bank letters of credit received as collateral, guarantees, credit default swaps sold, and the specified credit equivalent exposures to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. Therefore, AIG's reported credit exposures to a counterparty reflect available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, trading securities, derivative exposures, insurance credit and any other counterparty credit exposures.  154 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  AIG monitors and controls its company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempts to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in certain circumstances, AIG may require third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. These guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts are also treated as credit exposure and are added to AIG's risk concentration exposure data.   AIG's single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 25 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2012 compared to 30 percent at December 31, 2011. Exposure to the U.S. Government primarily includes credit exposure related to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and to direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) based upon their U.S. Government conservatorship. The reduction in exposure was primarily related to U.S. government-sponsored entities. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at March 31, 2012, AIG's largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure was related to a non-financial corporate counterparty and that exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2012, compared to 0.5 percent at December 31, 2011.   AIG's single largest industry credit exposure at March 31, 2012 was to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of March 31, 2012, credit exposure to this sector was $98 billion, or 94 percent of Total equity compared to 106 percent at December 31, 2011.   At March 31, 2012:   •$93.4 billion, or 95 percent, of these global financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings.  •$4.6 billion, or 5 percent, were considered non-investment grade. Most of the non-investment grade exposure was to financial institutions in countries AIG does not consider of investment grade quality. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade-rated financial institutions was $2.0 billion.  •AIG's aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $38.6 billion.  •Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $18.6 billion, or 19 percent of the total global financial institution credit exposure.  •The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, and the fronting of risk management policies to captive insurers of these financial institutions.    Of the $98 billion aggregate financial exposure, $34.9 billion was to United Kingdom and European-based financial institutions.    •$11.2 billion of this aggregate credit exposure was to non-bank institutions, mostly insurers and reinsurers, with $8.6 billion, or 77 percent of credit exposure representing reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. $1.6 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non-banks was fixed maturity securities. Approximately 96 percent of the non-bank exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings.  •Aggregate credit exposures to the United Kingdom- and European-based banks totaled $23.7 billion, of which $22.6 billion were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade-rated credit exposures to European banks were $1.1 billion.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 155      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •AIG's credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $9.5 billion, of which $4.7 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the five countries of the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $1.4 billion, of which $924 million were fixed maturity securities. These credit exposures are primarily in Spain and Italy. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $2.0 billion, of which $811 million were fixed maturity securities. AIG's credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.

Covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and which have full recourse to the issuing bank) represented approximately 9 percent of the $11.2 billion fixed maturity securities. (b)Cash and short-term investments include bank deposit placements, operating accounts, securities purchased under agreements to resell and collateral posted to counterparties against structured products. Credit equivalent exposure to securities purchased under agreements to resell was $79 million (notional value of $3.2 billion). (c)Derivative transactions are reported at fair value. (d)Other primarily consists of commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures ($1.7 billion) and captive risk management programs in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands ($1.7 billion).   Out of a total of $4.7 billion of fixed maturity securities issued by banks in the Euro-Zone countries, AIG's subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $1.1 billion and $346 million, respectively, at March 31, 2012. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.  156 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

Approximately 81 percent of the fixed maturity securities of the United Kingdom and European non-financial institutions held by AIG were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Non-financial institution corporate exposure to Euro-Zone countries totaled $18.6 billion, with France representing the largest single country exposure of $5.7 billion. $10.9 billion of the Euro-Zone exposures were fixed maturity securities of which $2.4 billion was in France. Approximately two-thirds of the French exposures were mostly to issuers in the oil and gas, rail, utilities and telecommunications industries. Euro-Zone fixed maturity securities represented 31 percent of total non-financial institution corporate exposure in the United Kingdom and Europe. Euro-Zone periphery non-financial institution corporate exposures ($5 billion) are heavily weighted towards large multinational corporations or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (27 percent), telecommunications (18 percent) and oil and gas (6 percent).

(c)Other primarily consists of insurance related products, including captive fronting programs ($6.8 billion), trade credit insurance ($3.2 billion) and surety insurance ($2.1 billion).   AIG also had credit exposures to several European governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in the recent past by one or more of the major rating agencies. These downgrades occurred mostly in countries in the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy and Portugal) where AIG's credit exposures totaled $338 million at March 31, 2012. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits, rising government debt-to-GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these sovereigns, which have given rise to widening credit spreads and difficult financing conditions. These credit exposures primarily included available-for-sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. AIG had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece or Ireland.   AIG's aggregate credit exposure to the government of Japan was $8.8 billion at March 31, 2012. A significant majority of these securities were held in the investment portfolios of AIG's Japanese insurance operations.  158 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

United Kingdom structured products accounted for $3.5 billion or 44 percent of these exposures, while the Netherlands and Germany comprised 25 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the Euro-Zone periphery accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 92 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at March 31, 2012 based on external rating agency ratings.   In addition, AIG had commercial real estate-related net equity investments in Europe totaling $378 million and related unfunded commitments of $104 million.   ILFC's fleet includes aircraft on operating leases to United Kingdom and European airlines with a net book value of approximately $12.9 billion, of which approximately $3.1 billion, or 24 percent, are aircraft on lease to carriers based in the five Euro-Zone periphery countries.   AIG actively monitors its European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the Euro-Zone periphery, and uses various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine whether mitigating actions should be taken. Mitigating actions in these areas to date have largely included non-renewal of maturing exposures and sales and tender of securities. To date, AIG's purchases of credit default swap protection have been minimal. The financial condition of issuers is periodically evaluated, and internal risk ratings are adjusted as circumstances warrant. The result of these continuing reviews  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 159      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. has led AIG to believe that its combined credit risk exposures to sovereign governments, financial institutions and non-financial corporations in the Euro-Zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers.   AIG also monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Six countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at March 31, 2012, three countries were rated AAA and three were rated AA. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and France.   AIG also has a risk concentration, primarily through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies, in the U.S. municipal sector. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property and casualty insurance companies. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. AIG had $894 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios at March 31, 2012, compared to $892 million at December 31, 2011. These exposures consisted of AIGFP derivatives and trading securities (at fair value) and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.   AIG reviews regularly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. AIG periodically adjusts limits and reviews exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that it does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.        MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  Insurance and Aircraft Leasing Sensitivities  The following table provides estimates of AIG's sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                   Exposure        Effect      (dollars in millions)   March 31, 2012   December 31, 2011*   Sensitivity Factor   March 31, 2012   December 31, 2011            Yield sensitive assets    $ 325,900    $ 326,200    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves    $ (15,500 )  $ (15,800 )    Equity and alternative investments exposure    $ 34,500    $ 39,000    20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments    $ (6,900 )  $ (7,800 )    Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure    $ 5,700    $ 5,900    10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar    $ (570 )  $ (590 )            Exposures to yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short-term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIG's consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis.    •Total yield sensitive assets decreased $300 million compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to a decrease in cash and other assets of $1.1 billion, partially offset by an increase in fixed income securities of $805 million.  •Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 11.5 percent, or $4.5 billion, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to a decrease of $4.2 billion related to AIG's sale of AIA equity securities as well as decreases in other common equity securities of $723 million and mutual fund values of $69 million. The decrease was partially offset by increases in partnership values of $395 million, real estate investments of $141 million and other equity investments of $19 million.   160 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.    •Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure decreased approximately 3.4 percent, or $200 million, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to a $700 million decrease in Japanese Yen exposure related to the adoption of a new DAC accounting standard. The decrease was partially offset by changes in market values of fixed maturity securities of $327 million and changes in the portfolio across currencies of $123 million.    The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors are the same as those used in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:   •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax planning strategies and operating profitability of the character necessary for their realization;  •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), flight equipment, and reinsurance;   •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;  •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;  •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments;  •liabilities for legal contingencies; and  •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including CDS and AIG's equity interest in ML III.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. The following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2012. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, see the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.        RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET:  AIG considers the recoverability of its deferred tax asset to be a critical accounting estimate. The evaluation of the recoverability of AIG's deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.   See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 161      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS - SHORT DURATION (CHARTIS):  Recoverability of DAC is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months for short-duration insurance contracts. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.   For short-duration insurance contracts, starting on January 1, 2012, AIG has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable. AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy, as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.   AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on inforce business to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses, anticipated maintenance costs and unamortized DAC. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income of its Chartis domestic commercial and consumer and international commercial and consumer operations exceeded the sum of these costs at March 31, 2012.   On January 1, 2012, AIG adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $5.1 billion decrease in the January 1, 2012 consolidated DAC balance.        FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES:  See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.   Overview  The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                       March 31, 2012 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 268     91 %    Fair value based on internal sources     26     9            Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 294     100 %             (a) Includes $20.8 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  162 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   (b)Includes available for sale and trading securities.   Level 3 Assets and Liabilities   Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   At March 31, 2012, AIG classified $42.4 billion and $4.6 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 7.7 percent and 1.0 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at March 31, 2012. At December 31, 2011, AIG classified $39.4 billion and $5.3 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 7.1 percent and 1.2 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. AIG considers unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular unobservable input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   AIG classifies fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.   Maiden Lane III   At its inception, AIG's interest in ML III was valued and recorded at the transaction price of $5 billion. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the valuation methodologies applied to ML III since inception and sensitivity analysis disclosures with respect to the ML III interest.   Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio   The entities included in Global Capital Markets operations wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIG is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, those entities also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.

The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                       (in millions)   March 31, 2012   December 31, 2011            Regulatory capital    $ 2    $ 9      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO      2,141      2,711      Arbitrage – corporate      488      477            Total    $ 2,631    $ 3,197                    Regulatory Capital Portfolio    During the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, $775 million in net notional amount of regulatory capital CDSs were terminated or matured at no cost. The expected maturity of this portfolio continues to be monitored. As of March 31, 2012, the estimated weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was one year. There have been no requirements to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for financial institution counterparties was generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 165      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2012 other than for transactions where Global Capital Markets believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief. Although AIG believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and the expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.       Arbitrage Portfolio    A portion of the super senior credit default swaps as of March 31, 2012 are arbitrage-motivated transactions written on multi- sector CDOs or designated pools of investment grade senior unsecured corporate debt or CLOs.

(b)"High grade" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand-alone basis were predominantly AA or higher at origination. (c)"Mezzanine" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand-alone basis were predominantly A or lower at origination.  166 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   Corporate Debt/CLOs   The corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of CDS written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the CDS. These CDS transactions require cash settlement. This portfolio also includes CDS with a net notional amount of $1.3 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of CLOs, which require physical settlement.       Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio    Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased during the first quarter of 2012. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $4.9 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at March 31, 2012, a BET value is available for $3.0 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.9 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $3.0 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at March 31, 2012 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                           Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at March 31, 2012         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS Prime   RMBS Alt-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     36 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (189 ) $ (3 ) $ (15 ) $ (94 ) $ (47 ) $ (20 ) $ (10 )                Decrease of 5 points     178     3     13     85     49     13     15            Weighted         Increase of 1 year     22     1     1     15     3     2     -      average life     6.41 years   Decrease of 1 year     (38 )   (1 )   (1 )   (30 )   (3 )   (2 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     17%   Increase of 10%     (18 )   -     (3 )   (10 )   (3 )   (1 )   (1 )                Decrease of 10%     22     -     4     14     2     1     1            Diversity score(a)     13   Increase of 5     (6 )                                                 Decrease of 5     17                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100 bps     17                                                   (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2012, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.   There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  168 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.
