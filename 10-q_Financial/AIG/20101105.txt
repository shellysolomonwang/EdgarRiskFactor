Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (including Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A filed on March 31, 2010 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on August 24, 2010, collectively the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K) and throughout Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in each of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2010, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2010 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. Underwriting profit (loss) is utilized to report results for AIG's General Insurance operations and pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is utilized to report results for AIG's life insurance and retirement services operations as these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.   AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.     Executive Overview    AIG reports the results of its operations through the following reportable segments:    •General Insurance — branded as Chartis in 2009, is comprised of multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, includes the results of Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji).   •Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services — branded as SunAmerica Financial Group in 2009. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance, and group life and health products. In addition, Domestic Life Insurance offers a variety of payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Domestic Retirement Services businesses offer group retirement products and individual fixed and variable annuities. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and other fixed and variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. Domestic Retirement Services also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were written in (or issued to) the institutional market place prior to 2006.   •Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — provides insurance and investment-oriented products such as whole and term life, investment linked, universal life and endowments, personal accident and health products, and group products including pension, life and health, and fixed annuities in Asia.   •Financial Services — engages in diversified activities, including commercial aircraft and equipment leasing and capital markets operations, both in the United States and abroad.   109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Priorities for 2010 and 2011   AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2010 and 2011:    •Completing the Recapitalization and related transactions;      •completing the definitive documentation and executing the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Agreement in Principle, including the repayment of all amounts owed under the FRBNY credit facility (the FRBNY Credit Facility) provided by the FRBNY under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Agreement), between AIG and the FRBNY;   •closing the pending sales transactions for American General Finance, Inc. (AGF), AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) and implementing plans to monetize securities of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) received upon the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO);   •developing plans to monetize additional shares of AIA Group Limited (AIA) following completion of the initial public offering and listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on October 29, 2010; and   •pursuing options for a sale of Nan Shan.     •Continuing the stabilization and strengthening of AIG's businesses; and   •Continuing the wind-down of AIG's exposure to certain financial products and derivatives trading activities.     Significant Events in 2010     Recapitalization    As further discussed in Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September 30, 2010, AIG entered into the Recapitalization. The transactions constituting the Recapitalization are to occur substantially simultaneously at the closing (Closing) of the Recapitalization and include the following:    •Repayment and Termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility: At the Closing, AIG will repay to the FRBNY in cash all amounts owing under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the FRBNY Credit Facility will be terminated.   •Repurchase and Exchange of the SPV Preferred Interests: At the Closing, AIG will draw down an amount remaining available to be funded under the commitment of the Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury Commitment) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2009 (Series F SPA), between AIG and the Department of the Treasury relating to the Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (Series F Preferred Stock), less any amount designated by AIG (Series G Drawdown Right) to be allocated to the Series G Cumulative Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (Series G Preferred Stock), as described below. As of October 31, 2010, the total available funding under the Department of the Treasury Commitment was approximately $22.3 billion (this amount, less any amount designated for the Series G Drawdown Right, the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount). AIG will use the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount to repurchase all or a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in the SPVs (SPV Preferred Interests) corresponding to the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount (Transferred SPV Preferred Interests) and transfer the Transferred SPV Preferred Interests to the Department of the Treasury in exchange for shares of Series F Preferred Stock with an equivalent liquidation value.   •Issuance of AIG's Series G Preferred Stock: In connection with the Recapitalization, AIG and the Department of the Treasury will amend and restate the Series F SPA to provide for the issuance of the Series G Preferred Stock by AIG to the Department of the Treasury at the Closing. The right of AIG to draw on the Department of the Treasury Commitment will be terminated, and outstanding Series F Preferred Stock will be exchanged as described below.   •Exchange of Series C, E and F Preferred Stock for AIG Common Stock: At the Closing, (i) the shares of the Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (Series C Preferred   110      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Stock), held by the Trust will be exchanged for approximately 562.9 million shares of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), which will simultaneously be distributed to the Department of the Treasury; (ii) the shares of the Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (Series E Preferred Stock) held by the Department of the Treasury will be exchanged for approximately 924.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and (iii) the shares of the Series F Preferred Stock held by the Department of the Treasury will be exchanged for (a) the Transferred SPV Preferred Interests (as described above), (b) newly issued shares of the Series G Preferred Stock and (c) approximately 167.6 million shares of AIG Common Stock. After completing the Recapitalization, the Department of the Treasury will hold approximately 1.655 billion shares of newly issued AIG Common Stock, representing ownership of approximately 92.1 percent of the AIG Common Stock that will be outstanding as of the Closing.    •Issuance to AIG's Shareholders of Warrants to Purchase AIG Common Stock: Immediately after the Closing, AIG will issue to the holders of AIG Common Stock prior to the Closing, by means of a dividend, 10-year warrants to purchase up to 75 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate at an exercise price of $45.00 per share.   •Exchange of Equity Units: On October 8, 2010, AIG commenced an offer to exchange up to 74,480,000 of its Equity Units for consideration per Equity Unit equal to 0.09867 shares of AIG Common Stock plus $3.2702 in cash. The consideration offered per Equity Unit is the same number of shares and the same cumulative amount of cash per Equity Unit that a holder would receive if the holder did not tender into the exchange offer and instead held Equity Units and settled the respective stock purchase contract at its final stock purchase date with the proceeds from subordinated debentures. The 74,480,000 Equity Units AIG seeks to acquire represent approximately 95 percent of the outstanding Equity Units. If more than 95 percent of the holders of the outstanding Equity Units accept the exchange offer, the Equity Units accepted in the exchange offer will be prorated as necessary to remain within this limit. The exchange offer expires on November 10, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated by AIG. In addition, debentures included in the Equity Units not exchanged in the exchange offer will continue to be subject to remarketing. Depending on the amount of Equity Units that are accepted for exchange in the exchange offer, the trading market for the Equity Units that remain outstanding after the exchange offer is expected to be more limited. AIG may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, after the settlement date of the exchange offer, purchase Equity Units. Following completion of the exchange offer, AIG may also repurchase Debentures in a remarketing, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. No assurance can be given that AIG will complete the exchange offer or that the terms of the exchange offer will not be changed.   •The Department of the Treasury's Outstanding Warrants: The outstanding warrants currently held by the Department of the Treasury will remain outstanding following the Recapitalization; but no adjustment will be made to the terms of the warrants as a result of the Recapitalization.    These transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, whose terms may differ from those described above, and include the following material conditions:    •the Recapitalization transactions will generate aggregate proceeds sufficient to repay all amounts owing under the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •the FRBNY will not hold SPV Preferred Interests having an aggregate liquidation preference in excess of $6 billion;   •AIG and the primary insurance companies of Chartis and SunAmerica shall have rating profiles reasonably acceptable to the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury, the Trust and AIG;   •AIG shall have in place at the Closing available cash and third party financing commitments in amounts and on terms reasonably acceptable to the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury and AIG;   111      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •AIG shall have achieved its year-end 2010 targets for the de-risking of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (AIGFP); and   •shareholder, regulatory and other customary approvals.      AIA Initial Public Offering    During the second quarter of 2010, AIG and Prudential plc terminated the AIA purchase agreement they had entered in March 2010 and in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, Prudential plc paid AIG a termination fee of $228 million, which was included in Net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) during the second quarter of 2010. As a result of the termination, AIA is presented as part of continuing operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements (AIA was previously presented as discontinued operations upon the entry into the purchase agreement in March 2010). See Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of segment reporting presentation.   On October 29, 2010, AIG completed an initial public offering of 8.08 billion ordinary shares of AIA for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $20.51 billion. Upon completion of the initial public offering, AIG owned approximately 33 percent of AIA's outstanding shares. Accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG will deconsolidate AIA and expects to record a material gain on the transaction. Under the terms of an agreement with the underwriters, AIG is precluded from selling or hedging any of its remaining shares of AIA until October 18, 2011 and more than half of its remaining shares of AIA until April 18, 2012. Based on AIG's significant continuing involvement through its equity ownership AIA is not being presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements at September 30, 2010. At October 29, 2010 the fair value of AIG's retained interest in AIA was approximately $11.8 billion.   Under the Recapitalization Agreement in Principle, net cash proceeds from the AIA public offering will be held in escrow pending the Closing of the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Agreement in Principle. Upon the Closing of such transactions, these cash proceeds will be loaned by AIA Aurora LLC to AIG and will be used to repay amounts owing under the FRBNY Credit Facility. If the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Agreement in Principle are not completed, AIG expects that the net proceeds would instead be used to pay down the liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by FRBNY, including preferred returns. AIG expects that, unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, any excess would then be used to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility.   The value of the AIA shares that AIG will continue to hold following the initial public offering of AIA will fluctuate until the ultimate disposition by AIG of the AIA shares. The value of the AIA shares will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of AIA. The agreement with the underwriters precludes AIG from entering into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of its remaining interests in AIA while those restrictions are in place.     ALICO Sale    On March 7, 2010, AIG and ALICO Holdings LLC (ALICO SPV), a special purpose vehicle formed by AIG, entered into a definitive agreement with MetLife for the sale of ALICO by ALICO SPV to MetLife, and the sale of Delaware American Life Insurance Company by AIG to MetLife, for consideration then valued at approximately $15.5 billion, consisting of $6.8 billion in cash and the remainder in equity securities of MetLife, subject to closing adjustments. The ALICO sale closed on November 1, 2010. The fair market value of the consideration at closing was approximately $16.2 billion.   On the closing date, as consideration for the ALICO sale, ALICO SPV received net cash consideration of $7.2 billion (which included an upward price adjustment of approximately $400 million pursuant to the terms of the ALICO stock purchase agreement), 78,239,712 shares of MetLife common stock, 6,857,000 shares of newly issued participating preferred stock convertible into 68,570,000 shares of MetLife common stock upon the approval of MetLife shareholders, and 40,000,000 equity units of MetLife with an aggregate stated value of $3.0 billion. AIG intends to monetize these MetLife securities over time, subject to market conditions, following  112      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  the lapse of agreed-upon minimum holding periods. AIG expects to record a material gain on the transaction in the fourth quarter.   Under the Recapitalization, net cash proceeds from the ALICO sale will be held in escrow pending the Closing. Upon the Closing of the Recapitalization, these cash proceeds will be loaned by ALICO SPV to AIG and will be used to repay amounts owing under the Credit Agreement. If the Recapitalization is not completed, AIG expects that the cash proceeds would instead be paid to the FRBNY in its capacity as holder of preferred interests in ALICO SPV to reduce the aggregate outstanding liquidation preference of those preferred interests.   Prior to conversion into MetLife common stock, the participating preferred stock will be entitled to dividends equivalent, on an as-converted basis, to those that may be declared from time to time on MetLife common stock.   Each of the equity units of MetLife has an initial stated amount of $75 and consists of an ownership interest in three series of senior debt securities of MetLife and three stock purchase contracts with a weighted average life of approximately three years. The stock purchase contracts obligate the holder of an equity unit to purchase, and obligate MetLife to sell, a number of shares of MetLife common stock that will be determined based on the market price of MetLife common stock at the scheduled settlement dates under the stock purchase contracts (a minimum of 67,764,000 shares and a maximum of 84,696,000 shares in the aggregate for all equity units, subject to anti-dilution adjustments). The equity units provide for the remarketing of the senior debt securities to fund the purchase price of the MetLife common stock. They also entitle the holder to receive interest payments on the senior debt securities and deferrable contract payments at a combined rate equal to 5% of their stated amount. The equity units have been placed in escrow as collateral to secure payments, if any, in respect of indemnity obligations owed by ALICO SPV to MetLife under the ALICO stock purchase agreement and other transaction agreements. The escrow collateral will be released to ALICO SPV over a 30-month period, to the extent not used to make indemnity payments or to secure pending indemnity claims submitted by MetLife.   The value of the MetLife securities received in the sale of ALICO will continue to fluctuate until the ultimate monetization by AIG of the MetLife securities. These fluctuations will be influenced by market prices of MetLife securities generally, and the market prices of MetLife common stock in particular, which will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of MetLife. AIG is subject in each case to agreed-upon minimum holding periods that also restrict AIG's ability to enter into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of the securities consideration. These minimum holding periods and hedging restrictions cannot be altered without the consent of MetLife, so AIG will bear the risk of these market price fluctuations during the applicable holding periods. The amount of any gain or loss recognized by AIG upon each sale will depend upon the fair value of the securities consideration received as of closing and the proceeds received by AIG from the monetization of the securities. This may also result in AIG realizing ultimate cash proceeds from the monetization of the securities consideration that are substantially less than what might be expected from the value of such consideration as of the date of the closing of the sale.     AGF Sale    On August 10, 2010, AIG entered into a definitive agreement to sell 80 percent of AGF for $125 million. Since AIG's voting ownership interest in AGF will fall below 20 percent, AGF has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As a result of this transaction, AIG recorded an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2010. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2010 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.     AIG Star and AIG Edison Sale    On September 29, 2010, AIG entered into a definitive agreement with Prudential Financial, Inc. for the sale of its Japan-based insurance subsidiaries AIG Star and AIG Edison for $4.8 billion, less the principal balance of certain outstanding debt owed by AIG Star and AIG Edison as of the closing date. As of September 30, 2010, the outstanding principal balance of the debt approximated $0.6 billion. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2011, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.  113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    Nan Shan Transaction    In the fourth quarter of 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent share of Nan Shan for approximately $2.15 billion. On August 31, 2010, the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission did not approve the sale of Nan Shan to the purchasers. Although the sale was not approved by regulatory authorities in Taiwan, AIG is pursuing other opportunities to divest Nan Shan and believes the proceeds from the sale of this business will approximate the previous sale amount. In addition, AIG believes it will complete the sale of Nan Shan within 12 months with similar terms and conditions. Therefore, AIG continues to classify Nan Shan as held-for-sale and as a discontinued operation. This is based on management's expressed intent to exit the life insurance market in Taiwan.   See Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions.     Sale of Interest in Transatlantic    On March 15, 2010, AIG closed a secondary public offering of 8,466,693 shares of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic) common stock owned by American Home Assurance Company, a subsidiary of AIG, for aggregate gross proceeds of $452 million.     ILFC Liquidity    During the first nine months of 2010, ILFC significantly increased its liquidity position through a combination of new secured and unsecured debt issuances of approximately $8.8 billion and an extension of the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Approximately $4.0 billion of the $4.4 billion in debt issued in the third quarter of 2010 was used to repay loans from AIG. AIG used the $4.0 billion received from ILFC to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility. Availability of $318 million of debt issuances is subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, ILFC agreed to sell 64 aircraft to third parties, of which 59 aircraft, with an aggregate book value of approximately $2.6 billion, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. These sales are expected to generate approximately $2.3 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, 35 of the 64 aircraft were sold, of which 31 had been classified as held for sale. At September 30, 2010, 28 aircraft were recorded in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sales are expected to be completed for most of these aircraft during the remainder of 2010.    2010 Financial Overview   AIG's income from continuing operations before income taxes amounted to $422 million in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $939 million compared to the same period of 2009. These results reflected the following:    •an improvement in underwriting results for General Insurance and Mortgage Guaranty;   •an improvement of $660 million in Asset Management pre-tax earnings, reflecting decreases in impairment charges on proprietary real estate and private equity investments as well as the prior year quarter's goodwill impairment charges;   •losses of $885 million on sales of divested businesses recorded in the third quarter of 2009; and   •a reduction in net realized capital losses of $1.2 billion as discussed in Consolidated Results — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).    These improvements were partially offset by the following:    •a decline of $1.2 billion in Financial Services pre-tax income, reflecting a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains on the super senior credit default swap portfolio in Capital Markets of $807 million, as well as ILFC impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2010 of $465 million; and   •a decline of $1.2 billion in net investment income, primarily driven by lower valuation gains associated with AIG's interests in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) (together, the Maiden   114      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Lane Interests), as well as accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of $762 million in 2010.     Additionally, AIG recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $1.8 billion during the third quarter of 2010, which included a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion related to the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison as well as an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion on the sale of AGF.     Consideration of AIG's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management has assessed whether AIG has the ability to continue as a going concern. In making this assessment, AIG has considered:    •The commitment of the U.S. government to continue to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due;   •The execution of the Recapitalization Agreement in Principle;   •AIG's liquidity-related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility, including the Recapitalization;   •The additional capital provided or committed through the Department of the Treasury Commitment until completion of the Recapitalization;   •The plans to monetize the MetLife securities received upon the ALICO closing;   •The plans to sell the remaining shares in AIA;   •The level of AIG's realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders' equity and on the capital levels of AIG's insurance subsidiaries;   •The continuing liquidity needs in certain of AIG's businesses and AIG's actions to address such needs;   •The substantial risks to which AIG is subject; and   •AIG's ability to obtain third party financing and/or ability to access capital markets following the Recapitalization.    In considering these items, management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of AIG's risks and uncertainties. Management also assessed other items and risks arising in AIG's businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto. After consideration, management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG's businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.   It is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management's plans could be materially different, that one or more of management's significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect and that AIG could fail to complete the Recapitalization. If one or more of these possible outcomes is realized and third party financing and existing liquidity sources, including those from the U.S. Government, are not sufficient, without continued support from the U.S. Government in the future there could exist substantial doubt about AIG's ability to operate as a going concern.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding going concern considerations.  115                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Capital Resources and Liquidity       Liquidity       Overview    At September 30, 2010, remaining amounts available under the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury Commitment were $14.9 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively, compared to $17.1 billion and $24.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009.   AIG manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels. AIG expects the parent's primary uses of available cash will be debt service and subsidiary funding. AIG expects that dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries will support AIG Parent's liquidity needs. The FRBNY Credit Facility is also expected to continue to be a source of liquidity until the Closing of the Recapitalization, as described more fully above, whereby AIG intends to fully repay and terminate the FRBNY Credit Facility. In addition, although the Department of the Treasury Commitment may also be used as a source of funding, primarily to support the capital needs of AIG's insurance company subsidiaries, AIG does not expect to utilize the Department of the Treasury Commitment for this purpose. Instead, AIG expects to use the Department of the Treasury Commitment as described under Repurchase and Exchange of the SPV Preferred Interests under Recapitalization above.   Until the Closing and unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net proceeds from the sales of operations and assets are expected to be used to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes except proceeds from the sale of the MetLife securities and the remaining AIA shares must be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests.   In the event the Recapitalization does not close, AIG expects that the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury Commitment will continue to be available under the existing terms and conditions to support AIG Parent's liquidity needs.   AIG expects that its subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due for at least the next twelve months through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, maturing investments and asset sales as well as potential debt issuances.   See further discussion regarding AIG's liquidity considerations in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries.   Analysis of sources and uses of cash  The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                         Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)   2010   2009            Summary:                    Net cash provided by operating activities    $ 15,115    $ 11,974        Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities      (7,527 )    9,149        Net cash (used in) financing activities      (8,772 )    (25,003 )      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      (4 )    195            Change in cash      (1,188 )    (3,685 )    Cash at beginning of period      4,400      8,642      Reclassification of assets held for sale      (1,544 )    -            Cash at end of period    $ 1,668    $ 4,957              Net cash provided by operating activities was positive for both the nine months of 2010 and 2009, principally due to continued positive cash flows from AIG's life insurance subsidiaries.   Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits, but the ability of general insurance operations to generate positive cash flow is affected by operating expenses, the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies, as well as by policy retention rates. Cash provided by  116      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  General Insurance operations was $1.0 billion for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $1.5 billion in the same period in 2009 as a reduction in claims paid was partially offset by declines in premiums collected, arising primarily from a decrease in domestic production. Catastrophic events and significant casualty losses, the timing and effect of which are inherently unpredictable, reduce operating cash flow for AIG's General Insurance operations. Cash provided by AIG's life insurance subsidiaries, including entities presented as discontinued operations, was $10.1 billion for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $5.7 billion in the same period in 2009 as growth in international markets was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from domestic operations. Cash flows provided from Financial Services including entities presented as discontinued operations were $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease can be attributed in part to the continued wind-down of Capital Markets' businesses and portfolio.   The Capital Markets wind-down and other segment developments affecting net income described above are further discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Accrued compounding interest and fees (reflected as non-cash expenses) were paid in kind in both periods under the provisions of the FRBNY Credit Facility and, accordingly, did not reduce operating cash flow in either period. Debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility includes total accrued compounding interest and fees of $6.2 billion at September 30, 2010, the payment of which will be reflected as a reduction in operating cash flows in the period that the accrued compounding interest and fees for the FRBNY Credit Facility are paid.   Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities due to AIG's ability to invest cash generated from operating activities, and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in the 2008 and 2009 time frame. In the first nine months of 2009, Net cash provided by investing activities resulted from the net proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments.   Net cash used in financing activities was significantly lower in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of declines in policyholder contract withdrawals, reflecting improved conditions for the life insurance and retirement services businesses, as well as the issuances of long-term debt by ILFC, which is discussed in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC. See Contractual Obligations herein for additional information.  117      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      FRBNY Credit Facility   The following table presents changes in net borrowings outstanding and the remaining available amount that can be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility:                      Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 (in millions)                Net borrowings outstanding, January 1, 2010   $ 17,900        Loans to AIGFP for collateral postings, GIA and other maturities     850        AIGFP repayments to AIG     (1,431 )      Debt payments     2,484        AIG Funding commercial paper maturities     2,000        Dividends from subsidiaries(a)     (640 )      Net loan repayments to AGF     800        Net cash proceeds applied as mandatory prepayments     (5,825 )      Other borrowings and repayments, net     (1,850 )          Net borrowings outstanding, September 30, 2010     14,288      Accrued compounding interest and fees inception through December 31, 2009     5,535      Accrued compounding interest and fees January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010(b)     647            Total balance outstanding, September 30, 2010   $ 20,470            Total FRBNY Credit Facility, January 1, 2010(c)   $ 35,000        Mandatory prepayments     (5,825 )          Total FRBNY Credit Facility, September 30, 2010(c)     29,175        Less: borrowings outstanding, September 30, 2010     (14,288 )          Remaining available amount, September 30, 2010(c)   $ 14,887               (a)Excludes dividends of $520 million which are included in the Net cash proceeds applied as mandatory prepayments line.  (b) Excludes interest payable of $2.3 million at September 30, 2010, which was included in Other liabilities. (c)The FRBNY has been considering whether prior payments made by AIG to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility from asset sales should be treated as mandatory prepayments that reduce the amount available under the FRBNY Credit Facility. If the FRBNY takes this position, at September 30, 2010, this would reduce the amount available to be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility by approximately $3.6 billion. Such reduction in the FRBNY Credit Facility would trigger accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of approximately $600 million.   As noted above, AIG intends to fully repay and terminate the FRBNY Credit Facility upon the Closing of the Recapitalization transaction.       Department of the Treasury Commitment    On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which (i) AIG issued to the Department of the Treasury (a) 300,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, and (b) a warrant to purchase 150 shares of AIG Common Stock, and (ii) the Department of the Treasury agreed to provide up to $29.835 billion pursuant to the Department of the Treasury Commitment in exchange for increases in the liquidation preference of the Series F Preferred Stock. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2009 Financial Statements for further discussion.  118      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents changes in drawdowns and the remaining available amount under the Department of the Treasury Commitment:                      Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 (in millions)                Total drawdowns, January 1, 2010   $ 5,344        Redemption and repurchase of securities held by insurance subsidiaries     2,230        UGC related restructuring transactions     48        Net paydown (borrowings) under FRBNY Credit Facility     (79 )          Total drawdowns, September 30, 2010   $ 7,543            Total Department of the Treasury commitment, January 1, 2010   $ 29,835        Less: drawdowns, September 30, 2010     (7,543 )          Remaining available amount, September 30, 2010   $ 22,292              As noted above, pursuant to the Recapitalization, AIG intends to draw down a significant portion of the availability under this commitment to purchase a portion of the SPV Preferred Interests which will be exchanged with the Department of the Treasury.   Additional details regarding liquidity sources are included in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries below.       AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due    AIG expects that the repayment of future debt maturities (including the FRBNY Credit Facility) and the payment of the preferred returns and liquidation preference on the SPV Preferred Interests will be its primary uses of available cash over the next 12 months. Until the Closing and unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net proceeds from the sales of operations and assets are expected to be used to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes. This is exclusive of proceeds from the sale of the MetLife securities and the remaining AIA shares, which must be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests.   See Recapitalization above for a discussion of the expected use of proceeds under the Recapitalization.  The following table summarizes the maturing debt at September 30, 2010 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                 (in millions)   Fourth Quarter 2010   First Quarter 2011   Second Quarter 2011   Third Quarter 2011   Total            ILFC   $ 2,502 * $ 1,488   $ 1,278   $ 1,984   $ 7,252      AIG borrowings supported by assets     1,252     221     1,541     1,132     4,146      AIG general borrowings     500     141     -     -     641      Other     29     5     3     4     41            Total   $ 4,283   $ 1,855   $ 2,822   $ 3,120   $ 12,080               *On October 7, 2010, ILFC prepaid in full the $2.0 billion principal amount outstanding under its revolving credit facility with a scheduled maturity date of October 14, 2010.   AIG's plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows:    •ILFC's sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales (see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC below). During the first nine months of 2010, ILFC significantly increased its liquidity position through a combination of new secured and unsecured debt issuances of approximately $8.8 billion and an extension of the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Availability of $318 million of debt issuances is subject to the satisfaction of certain   119      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   collateralization milestones. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, ILFC agreed to sell 64 aircraft to third parties. These sales are expected to generate approximately $2.3 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, 35 of the 64 aircraft were sold. Based on this level of increased liquidity and expected future sources of funding, including existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, potential debt issuances and aircraft sales, AIG now expects that ILFC will be able to meet its existing obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months. Therefore, while AIG has acknowledged its intent to support ILFC through February 28, 2011, at the current time AIG believes that any further extension of such support will not be necessary.    •AIG borrowings supported by assets is comprised of debt under the Matched Investment Program (MIP) as well as Capital Markets debt being managed by Direct Investment. Approximately $3.5 billion of Direct Investment business' debt maturities through September 30, 2011 are fully collateralized, with assets backing the corresponding liabilities; however, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and Direct Investment business' ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. Assets from the MIP may be sold in connection with the Recapitalization which would require additional amounts to be funded to the MIP in the future.   •AIG expects to meet its debt maturities as well as potential collateral calls or termination payments related to certain financial derivative transactions until the Closing primarily through borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. Upon the closing of the Recapitalization, AIG expects to have access to other sources of liquidity as described below. In the event the Recapitalization does not close, AIG expects that the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury Commitment will continue to be available under the existing terms and conditions to support AIG Parent's Liquidity needs. AIG intends to re-access the long-term debt markets in the fourth quarter of 2010.        Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries    AIG Parent  The following table presents AIG Parent's sources of liquidity:                            As of      (In millions)   September 30, 2010   October 27, 2010            Cash and short-term investments    $ 545    $ 515      Available borrowing under the FRBNY Credit Facility      14,887      14,587      Available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment      22,292      22,292            Total    $ 37,724    $ 37,394              AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, catastrophic losses, or a further deterioration in the super senior credit default swap portfolio may result in significant additional cash needs, or loss of some sources of liquidity, or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   Historically, AIG has depended on dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. In light of AIG's current financial situation, certain of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG. As a result, AIG has also been dependent on the FRBNY as a primary source of liquidity, and on the Department of the Treasury Commitment to support the capital needs of AIG's insurance company subsidiaries. However, upon the Closing of the Recapitalization, AIG intends to fully repay and terminate the FRBNY Credit Facility. In addition, AIG also expects to draw down a significant portion of the availability under the Department of the Treasury Commitment to purchase a portion  120      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  of the SPV Preferred Interests. In the first nine months of 2010, AIG Parent collected $1.3 billion in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries (primarily from insurance company subsidiaries), which included $884 million in dividends from Chartis U.S.   AIG's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding. In the first nine months of 2010, AIG Parent retired $850 million of debt and made interest payments totaling $1.3 billion, excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. AIG Parent made $2.6 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, of which the majority was contributed to AIG Capital Corporation, enabling AIG Capital Corporation to redeem its preferred securities held by a Chartis U.S. subsidiary. In addition, in the first nine months of 2010, AIG Parent made net loan repayments of $800 million to AGF. At September 30, 2010, AIG Parent owes AGF $750 million under a demand note.   At the current time, AIG Parent has no intention of accessing the commercial paper market, one of its traditional sources for its short-term working capital needs. Upon the Closing of the Recapitalization as described above, AIG expects to have access to approximately $8.5 to $10.0 billion of actual and contingent liquidity, including cash and short-term investments, senior unsecured credit facilities, and the Series G Drawdown Right. AIG also intends to re-access the long-term debt markets in the fourth quarter of 2010.   General Insurance   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. One or more large catastrophes, however, may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected General Insurance operations. In addition, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of General Insurance subsidiaries as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital.   Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's General Insurance investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. AIG's asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of AIG's General Insurance investments and the payment of claims. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments for further information.   Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations   The most significant potential liquidity needs of AIG's Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies are the funding of surrenders and withdrawals. A substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies. However, management considers the sources of liquidity for Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed income securities, in order to reduce the high levels of liquidity which had been maintained during 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from their projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. A significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, which could be triggered by a variety of factors, including AIG specific concerns, could result in a substantial liquidity strain. Other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other economic or political upheaval.   AIG believes that its Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies currently have adequate capital to support their business plans. However, to the extent that these subsidiaries experience  121      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  significant future losses or declines in their investment portfolios, AIG may need to contribute capital to these companies.   Financial Services   AIG's major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of ILFC and AIGFP. Certain traditional sources of funds to meet the short-term liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available. These sources included issuance of commercial paper and bank credit facilities. However, during the first nine months of 2010, ILFC made significant progress in addressing its foreseeable liquidity needs, as further described below. In addition, AIG has sold a substantial portion of its consumer finance operations.   ILFC   During the first nine months of 2010, ILFC borrowed $327 million to refinance five aircraft and finance five new aircraft under its ECA Facility, borrowed $5.2 billion through secured financing arrangements, issued $2.75 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in private placements and issued $500 million in unsecured senior notes under a shelf registration statement.   During the second quarter of 2010, ILFC amended its bank facilities and term loans to increase its capacity to enter into secured financings to 35 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets as defined in its revolving credit facilities, which assets approximated $15.0 billion (subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones and prepayment requirements), and extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012.   In addition, as mentioned above, ILFC agreed to sell 64 aircraft to third parties. These sales are expected to generate approximately $2.3 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. Most of the sales of the individual aircraft are expected to be consummated during the remainder of 2010 and the related proceeds are receivable upon the completion of each individual sale. As part of its ongoing fleet strategy, ILFC may pursue additional potential aircraft sales. ILFC management is balancing the need for funds with the long-term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives.   Because the current market for aircraft is depressed due to the economic downturn and limited availability of buyer financing, it is likely that if additional aircraft are sold to meet ILFC's ongoing fleet strategy, realized losses may be incurred. In the first nine months of 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment charges aggregating $872 million and operating lease related losses of $90 million.   AIG expects that ILFC's existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, potential debt issuances and aircraft sales will be sufficient for ILFC to meet its existing obligations for at least the next twelve months.       ILFC Notes and Bonds Payable   As of September 30, 2010, notes and bonds aggregating $16.3 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2018. To the extent considered appropriate, ILFC may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds.   On August 20, 2010, ILFC issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.875 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2017. Part of the proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay loans from AIG. AIG used the proceeds received from ILFC to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility.   On March 22, 2010 and April 6, 2010, ILFC issued a combined $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent senior notes due September 15, 2015, and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.750 percent senior notes due March 15, 2017 in private placements. The notes are due in full on their scheduled maturity dates.   In 2009, ILFC entered into term loan agreements (the Term Loans) with AIG Funding in the amount of $3.9 billion. The Term Loans were secured by a portfolio of aircraft and all related equipment and leases. These Term Loans were scheduled to mature on September 13, 2013. The funds for the Term Loans were provided to  122      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIG Funding through the FRBNY Credit Facility. As a condition of the FRBNY approving the Term Loans, ILFC entered into agreements to guarantee the repayment of AIG's obligations under the FRBNY Credit Agreement up to an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding balance of the Term Loans. ILFC prepaid the balances due under the Term Loans on August 20, 2010. As a result of ILFC's repayment of the Term Loans from AIG Funding, ILFC no longer guarantees AIG's obligations under the FRBNY Credit Agreement, and the FRBNY released its liens on the collateral securing these loans.       ILFC ECA Facilities   ILFC has a $4.3 billion 1999 ECA Facility that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.83 percent to 5.86 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At September 30, 2010, ILFC had 15 loans with a remaining principal balance of $56 million outstanding under this facility. At September 30, 2010, the net book value of the related aircraft was $1.6 billion. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of an ILFC subsidiary, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility.   ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 ECA Facility, which was amended in May 2009 to allow ILFC to borrow up to a maximum of $4.6 billion to fund the purchase of Airbus aircraft delivered through September 30, 2010. This facility is also guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 2.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 3.40 percent to 4.71 percent. At September 30, 2010, ILFC had financed 76 aircraft using approximately $4.3 billion under this facility and approximately $2.8 billion was outstanding. At September 30, 2010, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 0.47 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. At September 30, 2010, the net book value of the related aircraft was approximately $4.4 billion. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC's notes and bonds payable in the table below.   ILFC borrowed $327 million to refinance five aircraft and finance five new aircraft under the 2004 ECA Facility during the first nine months of 2010. ILFC's current credit ratings require (i) the segregation of security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments received for aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts, controlled by the trustees of the 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities; and (ii) the filings of individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which the aircraft is registered. At September 30, 2010, ILFC had segregated security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments aggregating $361 million related to such aircraft. Segregated rental payments are used to pay scheduled principal and interest on the ECA facilities as they become due.   During the first quarter of 2010, ILFC entered into agreements to cross-collateralize the two ECA Facilities. In conjunction with the agreement, ILFC agreed to an acceleration event, which would accelerate debt related to the ten aircraft financed during 2010 if, among other things, ILFC were to sell aircraft with an aggregate book value exceeding an agreed upon amount, currently approximately $10.6 billion, within a period starting from the date of the agreement until December 31, 2012.   New financings are no longer available to ILFC under either the 1999 or 2004 ECA facility.       ILFC Bank Financings and Other Secured Financings   At September 30, 2010, the total funded amount of ILFC's bank financings was $4.6 billion, which includes $4.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. The fundings mature through October 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from 0.65 percent to 2.15 percent. At September 30, 2010, the interest rates ranged from 0.91 percent to 2.44 percent.   On August 20, 2010, ILFC issued $1.35 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior secured notes due September 1, 2014, $1.275 billion of aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior secured notes due September 1, 2016, and $1.275 billion of aggregate principal amount of 7.125 percent senior secured notes due  123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  September 1, 2018. The proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repay loans from AIG. AIG used the proceeds received from ILFC to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility.   During the second quarter of 2010, ILFC amended covenants under its revolving credit facilities and bank term loans to increase its capacity to enter into secured financings from 12.5 percent to 35 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets, as defined in its credit facility agreement, which assets approximated $15.0 billion (subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones and prepayment requirements). In conjunction with the amendment, ILFC (i) extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012, with the loan secured by aircraft with an initial loan-to-value ratio of 75 percent, and increased the interest rate by 1.5 percent; (ii) pre-paid $410 million of bank term debt with original maturity dates through 2012; and, (iii) increased the interest rate by 1.5 percent on $75 million principal amount of bank term debt. On October 7, 2010, ILFC prepaid in full the $2.0 billion principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility with a scheduled maturity date of October 14, 2010.   On March 17, 2010, ILFC entered into a $750 million term loan agreement secured by 43 aircraft and all related equipment and leases. The loan matures on March 17, 2015, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75 percent with a LIBOR floor of 2.0 percent. The principal of the loan is payable in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization, however, ILFC has the right to voluntarily prepay the loan at any time, subject to a 1.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2011. On March 17, 2010, ILFC also entered into an additional term loan agreement of $550 million, of which $318 million is subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. The loan is secured by 37 aircraft and all related equipment and leases. The loan matures on March 17, 2016, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 5.0 percent with a LIBOR floor of 2.0 percent. The principal of the loan is payable in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization, however, ILFC has the right to voluntarily prepay the loan at any time, subject to a 2.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2011, and a 1.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2012.   AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.   AGF   In the event that the sale of 80 percent of AGF does not close by the end of 2010, as expected, then AIG expects that AGF will be able to meet its existing obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months.   Direct Investment Business and Capital Markets   Prior to September 2008, Capital Markets had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds, GIA borrowings, other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements. Capital Markets continues to rely on AIG Parent to meet most of its liquidity needs.

These  124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  assets and liabilities are being managed on a spread basis, in concert with the Matched Investment Program. Accordingly, gains and losses related to these assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of credit valuation adjustment gains and losses are reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Asset Management — Direct Investment Business.   AIGFP has continued unwinding its businesses and portfolios. During 2010, AIGFP reduced the notional amount of its derivative portfolio by 46 percent, from $940.7 billion (including $40.7 billion of intercompany derivatives and $183.5 billion of super senior credit default swap contracts) at December 31, 2009 to $505.8 billion (including $13.7 billion of intercompany derivatives and $87.8 billion of super senior credit default swap contracts) at September 30, 2010. AIGFP reduced the number of its outstanding trade positions by approximately 5,900, from approximately 16,100 at December 31, 2009 to approximately 10,200 at September 30, 2010. Included in the 10,200 trade positions are approximately 4,500 non-derivative asset and liability positions whose management was transferred to the Direct Investment business. In connection with these activities, AIGFP has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate "books" and has developed a plan for addressing each book, including assessing each book's risks, risk mitigation options, monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes. Each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of AIG. The plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve, and they contemplate, depending on the book in question, alternative strategies, including sales, assignments or other transfers of positions, terminations of positions, and/or run-offs of positions in accordance with existing terms. Execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving senior members of AIGFP's and AIG's respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences. Successful execution of these plans is subject, to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book, to market conditions and, in many circumstances, counterparty negotiation and agreement.   In connection with the wind-down, certain assets were sold. The proceeds from these sales have been used to fund AIGFP's wind-down and are not included in the amounts described above under AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due. The FRBNY waived the requirement under the FRBNY Credit Agreement that the proceeds of these specific sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the FRBNY Credit Facility, which would have resulted in a permanent reduction of the FRBNY's commitment to lend to AIG. Instead, the FRBNY has given AIGFP permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales, and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the FRBNY Credit Facility, with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the FRBNY Credit Facility. AIGFP is also opportunistically terminating contracts.   As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses. AIGFP has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio, including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in connection with ML III and through the ongoing termination of transactions in its regulatory capital portfolio, a sale of its commodity index business, termination and sale of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker, and sale and other disposition of its energy/infrastructure investment portfolio. AIGFP also has novated certain trades to AIG Markets. Due to the long-term duration of AIGFP's derivative contracts and the complexity of AIGFP's portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios will take a substantial period of time.   The cost and liquidity needs of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades. In addition, the Determination Memoranda issued by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation place significant new restrictions on the compensation of AIGFP employees included in the five executives named in AIG's Proxy Statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of AIG (Top 25) and AIG's next 75 most highly compensated employees and executive officers (together, the Top 100) and may impair AIGFP's ability to retain these employees, and consequently negatively impact the wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios.  125                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Debt   The following table provides the rollforward of AIG's total debt outstanding:                                            Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 (in millions)   Balance at December 31, 2009   Issuances   Maturities and Repayments   Effect of Foreign Exchange   Other Non-Cash Changes(a)   Activity of discontinued operations   Reclassified to Liabilities of businesses held for sale   Balance at September 30, 2010            Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                                      General borrowings:                                                        FRBNY Credit Facility    $ 23,435   $ 14,900   $ (18,512 ) $ -

Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of October 29, 2010. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the  127      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(b)S&P ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding.   These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of the Direct Investment business' GIAs and structured financing arrangements and Capital Markets' financial derivative transactions include provisions that require both the Direct Investment business and AIGFP, upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings, to post collateral or, with the consent of the counterparties, assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral that the Direct Investment business and AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effect of a downgrade in AIG's credit ratings on Capital Markets' financial derivative transactions, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   The completion of the Recapitalization is contingent upon the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury and the Trust being satisfied with AIG's credit ratings. AIG is taking steps to improve its capital, liquidity and risk profile. After the Recapitalization, AIG cannot predict how changes in the business environment, its own operations, or ratings criteria may affect its ratings. See Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  128      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                            Payments due by Period      At September 30, 2010 (in millions)   Total Payments   Remainder of 2010   2011 - 2012   2013 - 2014   2015   Thereafter            Borrowings(a)   $ 88,980   $ 4,283   $ 20,144   $ 10,654   $ 4,612   $ 49,287      FRBNY Credit Facility(b)     20,470     -     -     20,470     -     -      Interest payments on borrowings     57,290     1,159     8,375     9,280     3,047     35,429      Loss reserves     86,297     5,609     30,031     16,509     5,359     28,789      Insurance and investment contract liabilities     692,339     16,383     38,281     48,387     22,773     566,515      GIC liabilities     8,606     3     2,528     2,461     263     3,351      Aircraft purchase commitments     13,536     -     921     2,926     1,568     8,121      Other long-term obligations(c)     496     119     172     79     9     117            Total(d)   $ 968,014   $ 27,556   $ 100,452   $ 110,766   $ 37,631   $ 691,609               (a) On October 8, 2010, AIG commenced an offer to exchange up to 95 percent of the equity units (and therefore the underlying subordinated debt) for AIG Common Stock and cash. (b)Completion of the Recapitalization would accelerate the actual repayment. (c)Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (d)Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $5.3 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of Capital Markets' credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At September 30, 2010, the fair value derivative liability was $3.6 billion relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, net of amounts realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at September 30, 2010 AIGFP had posted collateral of $3.2 billion with respect to these swaps (prior to offsets for other transactions).  Additional information regarding AIG's contractual obligations follows:   Borrowings   Excludes borrowings incurred by consolidated investments and includes hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. The repayment of long-term debt maturities, net borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG and its subsidiaries are expected to be made through maturing investments and asset sales, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements, as more fully described in AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due above.   Loss Reserves   Loss reserves relate primarily to General Insurance business and represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by the individual General Insurance subsidiaries to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. The General Insurance subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $11.7 billion as of September 30, 2010. Further, General Insurance businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein), which could be monetized in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, management believes there are generally sufficient resources within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual needs. See Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity — Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash and Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity — Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries for matters that could affect operating cash flows and liquidity of the subsidiaries.  129      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities   GIC liabilities represent guaranteed maturities under GICs. Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate primarily to Life Insurance and Retirement Services businesses and include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of AIG's control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by individual Life Insurance and Retirement Services subsidiaries to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $14.9 billion as of September 30, 2010. In addition, the Life Insurance and Retirement Services businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein), which may be monetized in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, management believes there are generally sufficient resources within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual needs. Liquidity needs for GIC liabilities are generally expected to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.   Aircraft Purchases   At September 30, 2010, ILFC had committed to purchase 115 new aircraft deliverable from 2011 through 2019, at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $13.5 billion, the majority of which is due after 2015, with $282 million coming due through 2011. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC.       Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   The following table summarizes Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                             Amount of Commitment Expiration      At September 30, 2010 (in millions)   Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2010   2011 - 2012   2013 - 2014   2015   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 861   $ -   $ 760   $ -   $ -   $ 101        Standby letters of credit     1,228     1,058     26     20     5     119        Construction guarantees(b)     72     2     19     -     -     51        Guarantees of indebtedness     212     -     -     -     -     212        All other guarantees(c)     783     11     180     231     157     204      Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(d)     5,741     1,610     2,253     831     168     879        Commitments to extend credit     192     67     78     43     2     2        Letters of credit     249     160     89     -     -     -        Other commercial commitments(e)     767     20     -     -     -     747            Total(f)   $ 10,105   $ 2,928   $ 3,405   $ 1,125   $ 332   $ 2,315               (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.  130      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    (b)Primarily represents SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. (c)Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnifications included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d)Includes commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in limited partnerships and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate businesses. (e)Includes options to acquire aircraft. Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2010 is expected to be approximately $5 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (f)Does not include guarantees or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.   Securities Financing   The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.   See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends.   Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities   While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.      2010 Business Outlook   The following discussion supplements and updates the Business Outlook contained in AIG's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2010.       General Insurance    In May 2009, AIG completed the sale of its interest in the AIG Otemachi Building in Tokyo's prestigious Marunouchi business district — including the land and development rights. Approximately fifty percent of these interests were held by Chartis International subsidiaries with the remainder recorded in AIG's Other operations category as part of Asset Management results. Although the transaction qualified as a legal sale, it did not qualify as a sale for U.S. GAAP purposes due to AIG's continued involvement as a lessee, primarily in the form of a lease deposit. With tenant leases set to expire in December 2010, and the buyer not intending to extend the leases with any of the tenants, AIG will be vacating the building and a sale will be deemed to have occurred. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2010 AIG expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion ($812 million net of taxes).   On April 20, 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig, operating in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, resulted in a fire that led to the sinking of the rig and subsequent oil spill. AIG continues to monitor the casualty exposure to Deepwater Horizon and believes that carried loss reserves at September 30, 2010 are adequate to cover estimated losses attributable to this event. However, AIG's claims estimates may change over time, as the forensic investigation is incomplete, the cleanup is incomplete, and the litigation has only just begun.   There may also be other policyholders involved as the matter evolves. The types of claims may include, but not be limited to, cleanup costs, both directly incurred and those for which reimbursement to the government may be required; natural resource damages, including damages to the various fisheries impacted by the spill; property  131      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  damage to private property; business interruption to Gulf Coast businesses; the bodily injury and wrongful death claims of the workers on the rig; claims for the destruction of the rig itself and various class actions brought by Gulf Coast residents on various theories of liability. In addition, it is uncertain how the $20 billion cleanup fund established by BP may affect claims under Chartis' policies, as injured parties may seek compensation from the fund rather than through their own or others' insurance policies.       Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services    AIG's Domestic Life Insurance and Retirement Services companies have maintained higher levels of liquidity which has negatively affected net investment income results. AIG expects to reinvest a portion of these cash balances into longer-term, higher yielding securities in the fourth quarter of 2010 and through 2011.   Although there were no unlocking adjustments in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, management expects to complete its annual review of all actuarial estimates and assumptions in the fourth quarter. The review may result in fourth quarter changes in various actuarial assumptions including those pertaining to DAC, reserves and the fair value of certain variable annuity guarantees.   In 2010, long-term interest rates dropped to near historical levels. If such rates were to continue over an extended period of time, investment spreads would gradually narrow as new investment proceeds would be invested at lower rates that may only be partially offset by lower crediting rates. In addition, in a low interest rate environment, industry sales of fixed annuities tend to suffer. However, in an extended low interest rate environment, management would expect the current low surrender rates to continue.   Surrender rates for group retirement products are expected to increase in the remainder of 2010 as certain large group surrenders are anticipated.   AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies. Pools of highly-rated third party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance companies also cede excess, non-economic reserves carried on a statutory-basis only on certain term and universal life insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to an offshore affiliate.   AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of its intercompany reinsurance transactions. For this purpose, AIG has a $2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility outstanding at September 30, 2010, all of which relates to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. AIG has also obtained approximately $2.3 billion of letters of credit on a bilateral basis all of which relates to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. All of these letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015.   The fees paid to maintain these bilateral letters of credit are generally based on AIG's long-term debt ratings. Under the terms of the bilateral letter of credit, the issuing bank has the right to base its fees on AIG's credit default swap pricing. On June 30, 2010, AIG received notification of the bank's intent to do so. AIG expects that this change will increase the fees for maintaining this letter of credit from $16 million annually to approximately $64 million annually, based on current credit default swap pricing levels.       Mortgage Guaranty    The improvement in UGC's 2010 results is primarily the result of declining levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans, the effect of stop loss limits on certain second-lien and international policies, increased rescission activity on domestic first-lien claims and increased efforts to modify payment plans for currently delinquent domestic first-lien loans. If these trends persist, UGC's financial results may continue to show improvement in future quarters. However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the longer term outlook for the housing market, U.S. unemployment rates, the impact of future foreclosures on domestic home prices, loan modification programs, the elimination of tax credits for first-time homebuyers, moratoriums on foreclosures by  132      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  certain lenders and mortgage insurance rescission rates and the effects, if any, these factors may have on UGC's financial results.       Capital Markets Wind-Down    During the third quarter of 2010, AIG continued to make progress winding down the derivatives portfolio. At September 30, 2010, the portfolio was $505.8 billion (including $13.7 billion of intercompany derivatives), of which $87.8 billion were super senior credit default swap contracts. AIG expects to continue to reduce the size of the Capital Markets derivatives portfolio through the remainder of the year. If the wind-down continues as anticipated, AIG expects that late in 2010 or early in 2011 the remaining Capital Markets derivatives portfolio will consist of transactions AIG believes will be of low complexity or of low risk or not economically feasible to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.       FRBNY Credit Facility    The FRBNY has been considering whether prior payments made by AIG to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility from asset sales should be treated as mandatory prepayments that reduce the amount available under the FRBNY Credit Facility. If the FRBNY had taken this position at September 30, 2010, this would have reduced the amount available to be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility by approximately $3.6 billion. Such reduction in the FRBNY Credit Facility would have triggered accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of approximately $600 million.       Impact of Divestitures on Risk    With the closing of the ALICO sale on November 1, 2010 and the initial public offering of a majority stake of AIA on October 29, 2010, AIG's risk exposures declined significantly. AIG estimates that these transactions reduced AIG's total credit exposure by approximately 18 percent and cross-border exposures by approximately 32 percent compared to September 30, 2010. The successful completion of other potential sales/divestitures, such as AIG Star, AIG Edison, AGF and Nan Shan could reduce AIG's total credit exposure by approximately an additional 12 percent and cross-border exposure by approximately an additional 8 percent.   AIG's market risk exposures were similarly affected by the sale of ALICO and the completion of the AIA initial public offering. With the successful completion of these transactions combined with other potential sales and divestitures, such as AIG Star, AIG Edison, AGF and Nan Shan, AIG's yield-sensitive fixed income exposure could be reduced by approximately 45 percent. Foreign currency exposures could decline by 83 percent and equity and alternative investments could fall by approximately 36 percent.   See Risk Management herein for additional information.       Results of Operations    AIG reports the results of its operations through four reportable segments: General Insurance, Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, and Financial Services. Through these reportable segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG's Other operations category consists of business and items not allocated to AIG's reportable segments. AIG's subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG's Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad.  133                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Consolidated Results  The following table presents AIG's condensed consolidated results of operations:                                          Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Revenues:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 12,639    $ 11,695      8 %  $ 35,931    $ 39,052      (8 )%      Net investment income      5,231      6,409      (18 )    15,469      14,044      10        Net realized capital losses      (661 )    (1,855 )    -      (1,482 )    (4,973 )    -        Unrealized market valuation gains on Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio      152      959      (84 )    432      1,143      (62 )      Other income      1,730      2,396      (28 )    5,264      7,520      (30 )            Total revenues      19,091      19,604      (3 )    55,614      56,786      (2 )          Benefits, claims and expenses:                                            Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      11,175      11,340      (1 )    30,747      36,600      (16 )      Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses      3,898      3,533      10      11,168      11,765      (5 )      Interest expense      2,158      2,093      3      5,334      6,680      (20 )      Restructuring expenses and related asset impairment and other expenses      159      254      (37 )    339      908      (63 )      Net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses      (4 )    885      -      (126 )    1,192      -        Other expenses      1,283      2,016      (36 )    4,354      5,465      (20 )            Total benefits, claims and expenses      18,669      20,121      (7 )    51,816      62,610      (17 )          Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit)      422      (517 )    -      3,798      (5,824 )    -      Income tax expense (benefit)      469      (408 )    -      1,044      (1,510 )    -            Income (loss) from continuing operations      (47 )    (109 )    -      2,754      (4,314 )    -      Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense (benefit)      (1,844 )    94      -      (4,329 )    1,011      -            Net loss      (1,891 )    (15 )    -      (1,575 )    (3,303 )    -            Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests      504      (470 )    -      1,693      (1,227 )    -            Net income (loss) attributable to AIG    $ (2,395 )  $ 455      - %  $ (3,268 )  $ (2,076 )    - %                  Premiums and Other Considerations    Premiums and other considerations increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and higher in-force business as a result of improvement in persistency for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, partially offset by a decline in Commercial Insurance premiums.   For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, Premiums and other considerations decreased by $3.1 billion compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the effect of dispositions during 2009 totaling $5.4 billion, including the sale of 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic as well as the decline in Commercial Insurance premiums. Partially offsetting these decreases was the effect of the consolidation of Fuji and the increase in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services premiums noted above.  134      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Net Investment Income   The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income:                                         Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Fixed maturities, including short-term investments    $ 3,779    $ 3,477      9 %  $ 10,975    $ 10,985      - %    Maiden Lane interests      457      1,414      (68 )    1,846      126      -      Equity securities      93      89      4      252      278      (9 )    Interest on mortgage and other loans      110      141      (22 )    361      425      (15 )    Partnerships      154      416      (63 )    967      (429 )    -      Mutual funds      (3 )    113      -      (5 )    237      -      Real estate      239      219      9      711      681      4      Other investments      90      158      (43 )    380      443      (14 )          Total investment income before policyholder income and trading gains      4,919      6,027      (18 )    15,487      12,746      22      Policyholder investment income and trading gains      382      470      (19 )    311      1,694      (82 )          Total investment income      5,301      6,497      (18 )    15,798      14,440      9      Investment expenses      70      88      (20 )    329      396      (17 )          Net investment income    $ 5,231    $ 6,409      (18 )%  $ 15,469    $ 14,044      10 %            Net investment income declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to lower valuation gains associated with AIG's interest in ML II and ML III and a decline in income from partnership investments reflecting less favorable market conditions in the current year period.   Net investment income increased in nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to significantly higher income from partnership investments and increased valuation gains associated with AIG's interest in ML II and ML III. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Policyholder investment income and trading gains for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services (together, policyholder trading gains) compared to 2009. Policyholder trading gains are offset by a change in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets.   Both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 reflected lower levels of invested assets, including the effect of divested businesses, as well as lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments that were held for liquidity purposes.  135      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)                                     Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Sales of fixed maturity securities    $ 833    $ 254    $ 1,306    $ 645      Sales of equity securities      141      160      404      181      Sales of real estate and loans      8      (14 )    44      (29 )    Other-than-temporary impairments:                                Severity      (5 )    (1 )    (54 )    (1,472 )      Change in intent      (340 )    (11 )    (361 )    (883 )      Foreign currency declines      (17 )    -      (21 )    (88 )      Issuer-specific credit events      (461 )    (1,485 )    (1,833 )    (3,158 )      Adverse projected cash flows on structured securities      (1 )    -      (2 )    (144 )    Provision for loan losses      (88 )    (114 )    (289 )    (681 )    Foreign exchange transactions      (1,243 )    (38 )    262      (557 )    Derivative instruments      562      (504 )    (835 )    1,320      Other      (50 )    (102 )    (103 )    (107 )          Net realized capital losses    $ (661 )  $ (1,855 )  $ (1,482 )  $ (4,973 )            Net realized capital losses decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009 reflecting the following:   •increased gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in the current year periods;   •absence of significant losses incurred in 2009 related to sales of real estate and loans; and   •lower other-than-temporary impairment charges in the current year periods. Affecting the nine-month comparison was the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard commencing in the second quarter of 2009. The three-month period ended March 31, 2009 included non-credit impairments (i.e. severity losses) that are no longer required for fixed maturity securities. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Investments — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.   Significant foreign exchange transaction losses were incurred during the third quarter of 2010, primarily related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Gains on derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting for the third quarter of 2010 reflected the U.S. dollar weakening against the Euro and British pound, partially offset by the narrowing of AIG's credit spreads.   The foreign exchange transaction losses on derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 related primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, British pound and Japanese yen compared to the same period in 2009.       Unrealized Market Valuation Gains (Losses) on Capital Markets Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio    Capital Markets reported a decline in unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of decreasing corporate spreads in 2009 in the corporate arbitrage portfolio and the substantial improvement in prices of the underlying assets in 2009 in the multi-sector CDO portfolio.   The unrealized market valuation gains decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of losses in the corporate arbitrage portfolio caused by increasing corporate spreads in 2010 and decreasing corporate spreads in 2009, partially offset by improved prices of the underlying assets in the multi-sector CDO portfolio in 2010 compared to 2009.  136      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  See Segment Results — Financial Services Operations — Financial Services Results — Capital Markets Results and Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Other Income    Other income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to:   •lower aircraft leasing revenues reflecting $465 million of aircraft asset impairment charges;   •lower Direct Investment business revenues driven by foreign exchange losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, the negative impact of AIG's narrowing credit spread on the valuation of liabilities as well as impairments on real estate investments; and   •lower Consumer Finance revenues due to dispositions in 2010, including operations in Argentina, Colombia, Taiwan and its banking business in Poland.   These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $553 million reflecting the positive effect of derivatives where AIG did not elect cash flow hedge accounting.   Other income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to:   •a decline of $1.2 billion reflecting the negative effect of derivatives where AIG did not elect cash flow hedge accounting;   •a decline of $1.2 billion in credit valuation adjustments on Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value, excluding gains and losses which are reflected in Unrealized gains (losses) on Capital Markets' super senior credit default swap portfolio, partially offset by reduced losses from AIGFP from lower unwind costs;   •a decline of $906 million in credit valuation adjustments on Direct Investment business assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value; and   •lower aircraft leasing revenues reflecting an increase of $856 million of aircraft asset impairment charges and an increase of $90 million in operating lease-related charges with respect to aircraft sold, otherwise disposed of or held for sale.   This decrease was partially offset by a bargain purchase gain recorded by Foreign General Insurance of $332 million related to the Fuji acquisition.       Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred    Policyholder benefits and claims were essentially flat in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.   Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 due to:   •a reduction of $4.0 billion as a result of dispositions in 2009;   •a decrease in incurred policy losses and benefit expenses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services of $1.4 billion due to a decline in policyholder trading gains discussed above in Net Investment Income;   •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expense for Mortgage Guaranty operations primarily due to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies; and   •the effects of lower production levels for Commercial Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services.  137      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Partially offsetting these declines were increases due to the consolidation of Fuji. See General Insurance results herein for further discussion.       Policy Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses    Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to the consolidation of Fuji mentioned above and an increase in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services expenses, primarily comprising salaries and bonuses as well as strategic systems investments.   Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to reductions of $949 million as a result of dispositions in 2009. In addition, there were DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $601 million in 2009. There were no DAC or sales inducement assets (SIA) unlockings in the first nine months of 2010. Partially offsetting this decrease in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 were the effects of $222 million of amortization of a premium deficiency reserve by UGC in the first quarter of 2009 and increases due to the consolidation of Fuji mentioned above.       Interest Expense    Interest expense increased modestly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 as the effect of a lower average outstanding balance on the FRBNY Credit Facility was offset by increased amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset as shown in the table below. Interest expense decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to lower interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility reflecting a reduced weighted average interest rate on borrowings and a lower average outstanding balance.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses.       Net (Gain) Loss on Sale of Divested Businesses    Net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses includes the net gain (loss) on the sale of divested businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 included a gain of $228 million associated with the termination fee paid by Prudential plc to AIG. See Segment Results — Other Operations — Other Results herein for further information.       Other Expenses    Other expenses decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 due to a decline in goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by higher corporate unallocated costs, which for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 reflected an increased securities litigation charge.  138      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Income Tax Benefits    For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, the effective tax rates on pre-tax income from continuing operations were 111.1 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to the effect of foreign operations of $41 million, other permanent items of $561 million, partially offset by a net reduction of the valuation allowance of $118 million, and tax exempt interest of $143 million. The other permanent items of $561 million were primarily attributable to $220 million of nondeductible losses, realized gains resulting from transfers of subsidiaries of $78 million, and uncertain tax positions of $76 million. The effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to the effects of tax exempt interest income of $449 million, the excess amount of the Fuji bargain purchase gain for financial reporting over the tax basis which is essentially permanent in duration of $116 million, and a reduction of $443 million in the valuation allowance, partially offset by the effect of foreign operations of $416 million, and other permanent items of $299 million, which were primarily attributable to the nondeductible losses and realized gains resulting from transfers of subsidiaries discussed above.   When estimating the fair values of the subsidiaries to be divested, AIG considered, among other information, valuations prepared for various purposes. During the first quarter of 2010, AIG increased its estimate of the AIA and ALICO expected divestiture proceeds following an updated assessment of the range of valuation estimates that considered, among other factors, the expected proceeds from the sales to Prudential plc and MetLife Inc. announced in that quarter, which gave rise to a $910 million reduction in the valuation allowance. During the third quarter based on the expectation of lower proceeds from the sale of AIA ordinary shares, the realization amount of the deferred tax assets was reduced by increasing valuation allowance of $1.3 billion.   For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, the effective tax rates on pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations were 78.9 percent and 25.9 percent, respectively. The tax benefit reflected for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries of $931 million, partially offset by an increase of $108 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, an increase in the valuation allowance of $405 million, and the effect of foreign operations of $122 million. The tax benefit reflected in the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 was primarily related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries of $740 million and tax exempt interest of $521 million, partially offset by an increase of $514 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, an increase in valuation allowance of $336 million and the effects of variable interest entity losses of $371 million.   At September 30, 2010 AIG's net deferred tax asset was comprised of $3.8 billion, net of $19.9 billion valuation allowance, related to its U.S. consolidated income tax group, and $2.6 billion of net deferred tax liability related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. AIG assesses its ability to realize the deferred tax asset based on AIG's ability to generate gains on asset sales, including from the initial public offering of AIA, and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset. This assessment does not depend on projected future operating income of the U.S. consolidated income tax group.   In any interim period, the U.S. consolidated income tax group may generate income or loss. To the extent that any income is generated, the related tax expense may be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. Conversely, any tax benefits arising from losses may be offset by an additional valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Any reduction of the valuation allowance will be allocated to continuing operations, discontinued operations and other comprehensive income based on the intraperiod tax allocation rules. AIG's foreign subsidiaries and U.S. subsidiaries filing separate returns will continue to recognize tax expense and tax benefits, based on their income or loss, which will be reflected in AIG's consolidated income tax provision (benefit).  139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  See Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Discontinued Operations   The composition of total revenues and pre-tax income (loss) for results reported as discontinued operations were as follows:                                         Total Revenues         Pre-tax Income (Loss)              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions)       2010   2009   2010   2009            ALICO    $ 3,248    $ 4,059      (20 )%  $ 537    $ 370      45 %    Nan Shan      1,686      1,605      5      114      149      (23 )    AIG Star and AIG Edison(a)      1,394      1,078      29      (805 )    75      -      AGF      276      504      (45 )    (393 )    (214 )    -      Net loss on sales      -      -      -      (1,970 )    -      -      Consolidation Adjustments      154      86      79      154      75      105      Interest allocation(b)      -      -      -      (135 )    (143 )    -            Total    $ 6,758    $ 7,332      (8 )%  $ (2,498 )  $ 312      - %          Nine Months Ended September 30,                                          ALICO(c)    $ 10,249    $ 10,340      (1 )%  $ (1,742 )  $ 941      - %    Nan Shan      5,590      5,591      -      208      790      (74 )    AIG Star and AIG Edison(a)      3,610      2,755      31      (631 )    (129 )    -      AGF      1,657      1,612      3      (144 )    (658 )    -      Net loss on sales      -      -      -      (2,371 )    -      -      Consolidation Adjustments      (187 )    140      -      (209 )    111      -      Interest allocation(b)      -      -      -      (407 )    (487 )    -            Total    $ 20,919    $ 20,438      2 %  $ (5,296 )  $ 568      - %             (a) AIG Star and AIG Edison's pre-tax loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 includes the impairment of $1.3 billion of goodwill. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Goodwill impairment for further discussion. (b)Represents interest expense, including periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset, on the estimated net proceeds to be received from the sales of AGF, AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c)ALICO's pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 includes the impairment of $3.3 billion of goodwill that had been allocated to ALICO as a consequence of ALICO's removal from the Japan and Other operating segment. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Goodwill impairment for further discussion.       ALICO Results    ALICO total revenues declined for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to lower policyholder trading gains, which are offset in policyholder benefits and claims incurred. This decline more than offset the benefit of lower net realized capital losses and the 4 percent growth in premiums and other considerations primarily resulting from the positive effect of foreign exchange. Pre-tax income increased compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses partially offset by negative effect of the declining interest rate environment in Japan on variable life and annuity results.   ALICO total revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 decreased slightly from the same period in 2009 reflecting a decline of $1.1 billion in policyholder trading gains, which are offset in policyholder benefits and claims incurred. This decline was nearly offset by lower net realized capital losses and higher premiums and other considerations due to the positive effect of foreign exchange and continued strength in new and renewal business. ALICO's pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 was largely due to the impairment of goodwill discussed below.  140      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Nan Shan Results    Nan Shan total revenues increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to an increase in Premiums and other considerations resulting from growth in the business and the favorable effect of foreign exchange as well as an increase in Net investment income due to growth in the investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by net realized capital losses of $21 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to net realized capital gains of $83 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 due primarily to a decrease in gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.   Nan Shan total revenues were flat in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a decline in net realized capital gains was largely offset by increased Premiums and other considerations and Net investment income as discussed above. Included in Nan Shan's pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 is an additional loss accrual of $104 million associated with the expected sale of Nan Shan. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       AGF Results    AGF's revenues decreased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 primarily due to lower finance charge revenues reflecting the 2009 sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF's efforts to increase liquidity.   AGF's pre-tax loss increased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to higher operating expenses reflecting the write-off of AGF's intangible assets in third quarter of 2010 and lower finance charge revenues noted above. The increase in AGF's pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 was partially offset by lower provision for loan losses as a result of a decrease in the amounts provided for allowance for loan losses due to favorable trends in the credit quality of AGF's finance receivables.   As a result of the sale of AGF discussed in Note 1 herein, AIG recorded an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2010.   AGF's pre-tax loss decreased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a lower provision for loan losses as a result of a decrease in the amounts provided for allowance for loan losses due to favorable trends in the credit quality of AGF's finance receivables. AGF also benefited from lower fair value provision on finance receivables held for sale originated as held for investment and foreign exchange gains on foreign currency denominated debt. These favorable variances were partially offset by a decline in AGF's finance charge revenues noted above and higher operating expenses primarily due to a write-off of AGF's intangible assets in third quarter 2010, which was driven by the sale of AGF.       AIG Star and AIG Edison Results    Revenues increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to net realized capital gains of $199 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to net realized capital losses of $114 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009. The improvement in net realized capital gains was due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and a decrease in foreign currency translation losses as the value of the Japanese Yen strengthened against non functional currencies in the current year.   Pre-tax income (loss) decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion and a reduction in partnership and mutual fund income as well as the continuing impact of lower in-force business and lower surrender gains in 2010 versus 2009 as lapses trended down towards pre-crisis levels. Partially offsetting these decreases were the increase in net realized capital gains noted above and a reduction in restructuring costs.  141                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Revenues increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to net realized capital losses of $71 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to net realized capital losses of $902 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009. The decrease in net realized capital losses was due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and a decrease in foreign currency translation losses noted above.   Pre-tax income (loss) decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion and the continuing impact of lower in-force business and lower surrender gains in 2010 versus 2009 as lapses trended down towards pre-crisis levels and a reduction in the DAC benefit, net of unearned revenue liability, related to lower realized capital losses in 2010 compared to a year ago. Partially offsetting these decreases were the reductions in net realized capital losses noted above.      Segment Results   AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. In managing its businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business based on pre-tax income (loss), excluding net realized capital gains (losses), results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses, because AIG believes that this permits better assessment and enhances understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.  The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment.

As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business AIG uses underwriting profit (loss) to assess performance of the General Insurance business rather than statutory underwriting profit (loss).  142      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Commercial Insurance writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Commercial Insurance the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Commercial Insurance without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit Commercial Insurance to accept a risk.   AIG's Foreign General insurance group writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of branches and foreign based insurance subsidiaries. It also writes a small degree of life premiums (primarily traditional life products), particularly in the newly-acquired Japanese business, Fuji. Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. Foreign General insurance group operates in the Asia & the Pacific, Europe, and the Far East regions as well as in emerging markets.   On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Foreign General Insurance subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji which resulted in Foreign General Insurance gaining control of Fuji. Fuji's financial information is reported on a one-quarter lag. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, therefore, Fuji's results are now included in General Insurance and Foreign General results.

The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the cost of claims and expenses, respectively. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.   Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period.   The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio.  143      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  General Insurance Net Premiums Written   General Insurance net premiums written in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 increased 7 percent and 1 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2009 as increases from the Fuji acquisition in Foreign General Insurance are partially offset by decreases in domestic net premiums written. Domestic declines reflect General Insurance's risk management initiatives and continued price discipline in lines where market rates are unsatisfactory. The Fuji acquisition in Foreign General Insurance and strategic growth in higher margin lines of business are being slightly offset by adverse foreign exchange effects in the current period. While General Insurance continues to see improved premium and account retention, new business submissions, and a relatively stable rate environment, net premium writings continue to be affected by a weak domestic economic environment.  AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on General Insurance net premiums written:                            Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010 vs. 2009   2010 vs. 2009            Increase (decrease) in original currency*     5.8 %    (0.3 )%    Foreign exchange effect     0.7     1.6            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars     6.5 %   1.3 %             *Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.    General Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table summarizes General Insurance GAAP combined ratios:                                         Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Increase (Decrease)   Increase (Decrease)         2010   2009   2010   2009            Loss ratio      71.1      75.5      (4.4 )    71.5      71.9      (0.4 )    Expense ratio      28.2      29.7      (1.5 )    29.7      28.1      1.6            Combined ratio      99.3      105.2      (5.9 )    101.2      100.0      1.2                  Quarterly Underwriting Ratios   The decrease in the General Insurance combined ratio for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 primarily resulted from the following:    •a loss ratio for accident year 2010 recorded in 2010 which was 3.5 points lower than the loss ratio for accident year 2009. This decrease is partially due to the fact that in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 Foreign General Insurance incurred losses of $200 million for claim increases in the financial institutions professional indemnity book related to exposure to credit and fraud claims. No additional loss was recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010; however these reserves continue to be closely monitored and thus far have developed in line with expectations.   •prior year development, which amounted to $168 million of net adverse development in the current period compared to $246 million of net adverse development in the same period of 2009. The current period amount is net of a $153 million reserve discount, as discussed in the Discounting of Reserves section below. Included in the current period total is a net reserve strengthening of $180 million related to asbestos exposures. The asbestos reserve strengthening was the result of a review of all accounts in which General Insurance had entered into agreements to pay fixed amounts for a fixed period of time in exchange for a release from further claim payments, also known as buyout agreements. The current period amount is also net of $40 million of accrued premiums on loss sensitive policies. Prior year development accounted for 2.1 points of the calendar year loss ratio in the current period.   144      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •a decrease of 1.5 points in the expense ratio, which included the effect of the consolidation of Fuji results. Excluding Fuji, the expense ratio decreased 0.3 points driven by decreased acquisition expenses, partially offset by an increase in general operating expenses. Acquisition expenses decreased with the reduction of aggregate exposures in certain property and casualty lines of business. General operating expenses reflect the impairment of intangible assets described below, operational enhancements, and long term compensation program expense. Operational enhancements include the implementation of financial systems and an improved control environment.   •In the third quarter of 2010, Foreign General Insurance recorded an impairment charge of $64 million related to identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of an accident and health business in Japan that were determined to be impaired due to declines in the profitability of this business. This impairment charge added 0.7 points to the expense ratio.        Year-to-Date Underwriting Ratios   The increase in the General Insurance combined ratio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 primarily resulted from:    •a loss ratio for accident year 2010 recorded in 2010 which was 1.8 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2009. Excluding catastrophes, the accident year loss ratio for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2010 is 1.6 points lower than the same period of the prior year. The increase in the overall accident year loss ratio is due to approximately $873 million in catastrophe-related losses in the current period driven by the earthquake in Chile, flooding in the Southeastern United States, two severe windstorms in the Northeastern United States, flooding in Madeira (Portugal), U.S. hailstorms, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, the Icelandic volcano, and Hurricane Alex, compared to catastrophe-related losses of $55 million in the same period of 2009. Foreign General Insurance's losses related to the worldwide credit crisis, as described in the quarterly underwriting ratios section above, aggregated to $306 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009. No additional loss was recorded in the same period of 2010; however these reserves continue to be closely monitored and thus far have developed in line with expectations   •prior year development, which amounted to $77 million of net adverse development for the period compared to $650 million in the same period of 2009. The current period amount of prior year development is net of a $153 million reserve discount, as discussed in the Discounting of Reserves section below. The current period amount is also net of $18 million of returned premiums on loss sensitive policies compared to $172 million of returned premiums in the prior period. Also included in the current period total is a reserve strengthening of $98 million in the excess casualty line of business related to adverse development relating to accident year 2007. Prior year development increased the 2010 calendar year loss ratio by 0.3 points.   •an increase of 1.6 points in the expense ratio includes the effect of the consolidation of Fuji results. Excluding Fuji, the expense ratio increased 2.1 points due to a decrease in earned premium and an increase in general operating expenses, all of which were discussed in the quarterly underwriting ratios section above. The acquisition expenses are essentially unchanged reflecting increases from a 2009 commutation of a reinsurance agreement, resulting in a net reduction to the prior period acquisition expense, and the change in the mix of business, offset by Foreign General Insurance not renewing a high commission credit card indemnification program in Europe, as General Insurance focuses on product lines consistent with its risk appetite.    Quarterly General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Net investment income for General Insurance decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a reduction in returns from partnership investments. Returns on fixed income investments also declined as reinvestment rates have been lower than the original rates of maturing securities. General Insurance is also seeking to redeploy a significant amount of its liquidity into higher yielding investments. General Insurance incurred net realized capital losses in the third quarter of 2010,  145      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  mainly due to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to a change in its intent to sell certain mortgage-backed securities.   Year-to-Date General Insurance Investing and Other Results   In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, net investment income for General Insurance increased over the same period in 2009 primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments. Net realized capital gains were recognized in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments, higher gains on sales of fixed maturities and income from derivatives.   See Consolidated Results for further discussion on net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).

In addition, limited capital for new projects reduced the demand for general liability and commercial umbrella insurance.        Commercial Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents Commercial Insurance GAAP combined ratios:                                        Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,              Increase (Decrease)   Increase (Decrease)         2010   2009   2010   2009            Loss ratio      79.7      84.8      (5.1 )    79.4      80.9      (1.5 )    Expense ratio      22.0      21.6      0.4      24.2      21.2      3.0            Combined ratio      101.7      106.4      (4.7 )    103.6      102.1      1.5              The decrease in the Commercial Insurance combined ratio in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •an accident year loss ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2010 that was 2.9 points lower than the accident year loss ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2009. Catastrophe-related losses of $47 million were attributable to an August earthquake in New Zealand and further development on  147      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  catastrophes that occurred in prior quarters of the current year, compared to catastrophe-related losses of $55 million in the same period of 2009;    •prior year development, which amounted to $137 million of net adverse development for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to net adverse development of $256 million for the three months ended September 30, 2009 as discussed below.   •An increase in the expense ratio of 0.5 points driven by a decrease in earned premium, increases in general operating expenses, and partially offset by a decrease in acquisition expenses. General Operating Expenses include increases in allowances for credit risk reserves and operational enhancements (as discussed in General Insurance results above). Acquisition expenses decreased with the reduction of aggregate exposures in certain property and casualty lines of business.   The increase in the Commercial Insurance combined ratio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •an accident year loss ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 that was 1.9 points higher than the accident year loss ratio for the same period ended September 30, 2009, resulting from catastrophe-related losses of approximately $480 million attributable to the combined losses of two severe windstorms in the Northeastern United States, flooding in the Southeastern United States, the earthquake in Chile, U.S. hailstorms, Hurricane Alex, and the earthquake in New Zealand, compared to catastrophe-related losses of $55 million in the same period of 2009; and   •An increase of 3.0 points in the expense ratio due to a decrease in earned premium, an increase in acquisition expenses, and an increase in general operating expenses, all of which were discussed in the General Insurance results above.       Quarterly Commercial Insurance Net Loss Development   The $137 million of adverse development in the three months ended September 30, 2010 is largely attributable to adverse development of $119 million related to asbestos claims, $63 million in excess casualty claims, and $43 million in the specialty workers' compensation line of business. These losses were partially offset by $42 million of favorable development in the Lexington lines of business. The current period amount is net of a $135 million reserve discount, as described in the Discount on Reserves section below, and $40 million in accrued premiums on loss sensitive policies. For the current period, prior year development accounted for 3.1 points of the calendar year loss ratio.       Year-to-Date Commercial Insurance Net Loss Development   The $95 million of adverse development in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 is primarily attributable to favorable development in the Lexington lines of business being more than offset by $159 million of adverse development related to asbestos claims, $97 million of adverse development in specialty workers' compensation claims, and $79 million of adverse development in the financial institutions line of business. The $159 million of adverse development on asbestos claims relates entirely to accident years 1999 and prior and is primarily attributable to several large accounts. The current period amount is net of $135 million reserve discount, as described in the Discount on Reserves section below, and $18 million in accrued premiums on loss sensitive policies.   Quarterly Commercial Insurance Investing Results   Net investment income for Commercial Insurance decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a sharp decline in returns from partnership investments. Net realized capital losses were due to other-than-temporary-impairments related to the change in its intent to sell certain mortgage-backed securities as mentioned in the General Insurance section above.  148      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Year-to-Date Commercial Insurance Investing Results   Net investment income for Commercial Insurance increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments.   See Consolidated Results for further discussion on net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).

Overall, with the exclusion of Fuji, net written premiums are down 2.2 percent versus the same period in 2009. From a regional perspective, real growth in the Far East region was significantly enhanced by the Fuji acquisition. The Asia-Pacific region also did well while the Europe region took a slight downturn.       Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Net Premiums Written   Foreign General Insurance net premiums written increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to:   •the Fuji acquisition, which contributed $865 million to the total; and   •new business as global economic conditions improved.   From a regional perspective, real growth in the Far East region was significantly enhanced by the Fuji acquisition. The Europe region, which did well in its critical renewal season in the first quarter, remains positive for the period, as well. Overall, Foreign General Insurance continued an upward trend in production that began with the third quarter of 2009, which is attributable to improved retention and strong new business submissions.  AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Foreign General Insurance net premiums written:                            Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010 vs. 2009   2010 vs. 2009            Increase in original currency(a)     23.8 %(b)   8.5 %    Foreign exchange effect     1.9     4.0            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars     25.7 %   12.5 %             (a)Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.  (b) Substantially all of this increase was attributable to the Fuji acquisition.          Foreign General Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents Foreign General Insurance combined ratios:                                         Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Increase (Decrease)   Increase (Decrease)         2010   2009   2010   2009            Loss ratio      60.9      61.3      (0.4 )    60.9      57.3      3.6      Expense ratio      35.4      42.2      (6.8 )    37.1      39.2      (2.1 )          Combined ratio      96.3      103.5      (7.2 )    98.0      96.5      1.5              The decrease in the Foreign General Insurance combined ratio in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •a decrease in the accident year loss ratio of 1.5 points compared to the same period in the prior year. Catastrophe-related losses incurred in the current period were $25 million, mainly due to an earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, with no recorded catastrophic events in the prior period; and   •a decrease of 6.8 points in the expense ratio includes the effect of the consolidation of Fuji's results. Excluding Fuji, the expense ratio decreased 1.8 points due to decreased remediation costs and acquisition  150      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  expenses, offset by the write off of intangible assets, operational enhancements, and long term compensation program expense. Operational enhancements include the implementation of financial systems and improved control environment, and costs associated with securing financial strength ratings for certain subsidiaries. Acquisition expenses decreased primarily due to Foreign General Insurance not renewing a high commission credit card indemnification program in Europe as General Insurance focuses on product lines consistent with its risk appetite.    In the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 Foreign General Insurance recorded $200 million for claims related to the worldwide credit crisis, negatively impacting the loss ratio for the period. No additional loss was recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010; however these reserves continue to be closely monitored and thus far have developed in line with expectations.   The increase in the Foreign General Insurance combined ratio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •significant catastrophe-related losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to none in the nine months ended September 30, 2009, contributed 3.7 points to the loss ratio. Catastrophe losses included the earthquake in Chile, flooding in Madeira (Portugal), the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, the Icelandic volcano, Hurricane Alex, and the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand; and   •a decrease of 2.1 points in the expense ratio includes the effect of the consolidation of Fuji's results. Excluding Fuji, the expense ratio decreased 0.3 points, as discussed in the quarterly underwriting ratios section above   In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 Foreign General Insurance posted charges totaling $306 million for claim increases in the financial institutions professional indemnity book related to continued exposure to credit and fraud claims, negatively impacting the loss ratio for the period. No additional losses were incurred in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010; however these reserves continue to be closely monitored and thus far have developed in line with expectations.       Quarterly Foreign General Insurance Net Loss Development   Foreign General Insurance experienced $31 million of net adverse development in the three months ended September 30, 2010, including $31 million of favorable development related to Ascot, the Lloyds syndicate, and $24 million of favorable development in unrecoverable facultative reinsurance being more than offset by $61 million of adverse development related to asbestos claims, reflecting Foreign General's share of U.S.-located losses that were discussed above, and $44 million of adverse development in the U.K. professional liability line of business relating to conveyance negligence claims from the high level of residential real estate activity in 2008. The remainder was spread throughout the other lines of business. The current period amount is net of a $18 million reserve discount, as discussed in the Discounting of Reserves section below; there was no such discount in the prior period. The $24 million favorable development in facultative reinsurance is the result of the reversal of a prior judgment against Chartis and the release of the associated reserves.       Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Net Loss Development   Foreign General Insurance experienced net favorable prior-year development of $18 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, with $31 million of favorable development related to Ascot, $21 million of favorable development from the excess casualty line of business and $18 million of favorable development from the D&O line of business being offset by $67 million of adverse development in asbestos claims and $54 million of adverse development from the professional liability business segment. The remainder was spread throughout the other lines of business.   Quarterly Foreign General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Foreign General Insurance net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to lower mutual fund income and partnership results.  151      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Foreign General Insurance recorded net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 mainly due to gains in the sales of fixed maturity securities being more than offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange.   Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Foreign General Insurance net investment income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to higher partnership results, dividends earned, and other investment income being partially offset by lower mutual fund and interest income. Investment expense was also lower.   Foreign General Insurance recorded net realized capital gains in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 due to gains in the sales of fixed maturity securities and real estate, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments being partially offset by losses on derivatives.   On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Foreign General Insurance subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji. The acquisition of the additional voting shares resulted in Foreign General Insurance obtaining control of Fuji.   Because the acquisition was completed on the last day of the quarter, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when AIG issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The initial purchase price allocation was based on the information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests of Fuji as of the acquisition date. Fuji's financial information is reported to Foreign General Insurance on a quarter lag. As such, Foreign General Insurance was awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date. Furthermore, at the time, Foreign General Insurance had not obtained final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate and intangible assets.   During the quarter ended June 30, 2010, Foreign General Insurance completed the accounting for the acquisition and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded. Foreign General Insurance obtained the additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date including final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate or intangible assets. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, adjustments to the revised purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2010 occurred as a result of new information that became known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date. As a consequence, these adjustments have been reflected retroactively back to the date of acquisition.   At June 30, 2010, AIG reported that the acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $406 million, which was included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in Other Income. The adjustments to the revised purchase price allocation during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 reduced the bargain purchase gain by approximately $74 million to $332 million. AIG will retrospectively revise its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 when presenting comparative financial information containing that period. The bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of Fuji's common stock, which AIG believes is the result of macro-economic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fuji's financial condition and results of operations. AIG anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the Fuji shares.       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense    The following discussion on the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for the Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance reporting units in the General Insurance operating segment and loss reserves pertaining to divested and/or Noncore businesses and those of the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit collectively reported in AIG's Other operations category.  152      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the components of the loss reserves by major lines of business on a statutory annual statement basis(a):                        (in millions)   September 30, 2010   December 31, 2009            Other liability occurrence    $ 20,505    $ 20,344      International(b)      16,359      12,582      Workers' compensation      16,282      15,200      Other liability claims made      11,452      12,619      Mortgage Guaranty/Credit      4,688      5,477      Property      3,539      3,872      Auto liability      3,195      4,164      Products liability      2,355      2,414      Medical malpractice      1,763      1,672      Accident and health      1,410      1,677      Aircraft      1,168      1,388      Commercial multiple peril      1,006      1,081      Fidelity/surety      942      875      Reinsurance      130      154      Other      1,503      1,867            Total    $ 86,297    $ 85,386               (a)Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. (b)Includes $2.2 billion related to the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.    AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves (IBNR) and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  The following table classifies the components of the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense by business unit:                         (in millions)   September 30, 2010   December 31, 2009            General Insurance segment:                    Commercial Insurance    $ 49,711    $ 50,498        Foreign General Insurance      13,997      12,688            Total General Insurance      63,708      63,186              Mortgage Guaranty      3,918      4,713            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 67,626    $ 67,899             153                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Discounting of Reserves   At September 30, 2010, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.81 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain asbestos business that was written by General Insurance is discounted based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business. The discount is comprised of the following: $669 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance and $2.09 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance; and $53 million — non-tabular discount for asbestos for General Insurance.   Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that the net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of September 30, 2010. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of September 30, 2010. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  The following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves:                                   Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 67,423    $ 65,770    $ 67,899    $ 72,455      Foreign exchange effect      580      245      (635 )    1,035      Acquisitions      -      -      1,538 (a)    -      Dispositions      -      (1,819 )    (84 )    (9,657 )(b)          Losses and loss expenses incurred:(c)                                Current year      5,945      6,406      17,482      21,202        Prior years, other than accretion of discount      387      191      (226 )    526        Prior years, accretion of discount      (26 )    98      146      294            Losses and loss expenses incurred      6,306      6,695      17,402      22,022            Losses and loss expenses paid(c)      6,683      6,017      18,492      20,981            Activity of discontinued operations      -      (1 )    -      (1 )    Reclassified to liabilities held for sale      -      -      (2 )    -            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 67,626    $ 64,873    $ 67,626    $ 64,873               (a)Represents the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for three-month period ended September 30, 2010. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   See General Insurance Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  155      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  As described more fully in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, $389 million gross and $160 million net of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the table that follows. This development was primarily attributable to several large accounts. In addition, a minor adjustment to the environmental gross and net reserves was also recognized.  The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined:                                   2010   2009      Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)       Gross   Net   Gross   Net            Asbestos:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 3,236    $ 1,151    $ 3,443    $ 1,200        Dispositions      -      -      (84 )    (21 )      Losses and loss expenses incurred*      389      160      184      78        Losses and loss expenses paid*      (492 )    (180 )    (473 )    (129 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 3,133    $ 1,131    $ 3,070    $ 1,128            Environmental:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 338    $ 159    $ 417    $ 194        Dispositions      -      -      (37 )    (7 )      Losses and loss expenses incurred*      18      17      2      -        Losses and loss expenses paid*      (73 )    (33 )    (37 )    (23 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 283    $ 143    $ 345    $ 164            Combined:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 3,574    $ 1,310    $ 3,860    $ 1,394        Dispositions      -      -      (121 )    (28 )      Losses and loss expenses incurred*      407      177      186      78        Losses and loss expenses paid*      (565 )    (213 )    (510 )    (152 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 3,416    $ 1,274    $ 3,415    $ 1,292               *All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years, primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior years.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at September 30, 2010 by approximately 0.2 years and 0.6 years, respectively; and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at September 30, 2009 by approximately 0.8 years and 1.9 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves are not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.  The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                   2010    2009      Nine Months Ended September 30,   Gross   Net   Gross   Net            Survival ratios:                                Asbestos      4.9      4.6      4.5      3.6        Environmental      4.1      3.4      4.3      3.3        Combined      4.8      4.4      4.4      3.6                  Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations    AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment, operating as SunAmerica Financial Group, is comprised of several life insurance and retirement services businesses that offer a comprehensive suite of life insurance, retirement savings products and guaranteed income solutions through an established multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, career financial advisors, wholesale life brokers, insurance agents and a direct-to-consumer platform.   SunAmerica Financial Group's businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance, and group life and health products. In addition, SunAmerica Financial Group's businesses offer defined contribution retirement plans, group and individual fixed and variable annuities, group and individual mutual funds financial planning and investment advisory services and retirement income solutions. SunAmerica Financial Group also offers a variety of payout annuities, including immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and fixed and variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. SunAmerica Financial Group also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were issued to the institutional market place prior to 2006.   In managing SunAmerica Financial Group, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses). Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) enhances the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of SunAmerica Financial Group. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the tables that follow.  157                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   The following table presents Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services results:                                          Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Domestic Life Insurance:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 992    $ 1,012      (2 )%  $ 3,060    $ 3,253      (6 )%      Net investment income      1,105      1,015     9      3,189      2,775      15        Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      1,253      1,209     4      3,878      3,785      2        Policy acquisition and other expenses      481      415     16      1,257      1,309      (4 )          Pre-tax income before net realized capital losses      363      403     (10 )    1,114      934      19      Net realized capital losses      (20 )    (173 )   -      (260 )    (732 )    -            Pre-tax income    $ 343    $ 230     49 %  $ 854    $ 202      323 %          Domestic Retirement Services:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 276    $ 265     4 %  $ 838    $ 795      5 %      Net investment income      1,551      1,724     (10 )    4,802      4,115      17        Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      885      897     (1 )    2,727      3,153      (14 )      Policy acquisition and other expenses      327      288     14      872      1,390      (37 )          Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains (losses)      615      804     (24 )    2,041      367      456      Net realized capital gains (losses)      40      (1,256 )   -      (1,482 )    (2,418 )    -            Pre-tax income (loss)    $ 655    $ (452 )   - %  $ 559    $ (2,051 )    - %          Total Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 1,268    $ 1,277      (1 )%  $ 3,898    $ 4,048      (4 )%      Net investment income      2,656      2,739     (3 )    7,991      6,890      16        Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      2,138      2,106     2      6,605      6,938      (5 )      Policy acquisition and other expenses      808      703     15      2,129      2,699      (21 )          Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains (losses)      978      1,207     (19 )    3,155      1,301      143      Net realized capital gains (losses)      20      (1,429 )   -      (1,742 )    (3,150 )    -            Pre-tax income (loss)    $ 998    $ (222 )   - %  $ 1,413    $ (1,849 )    - %            Quarterly Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reported a decrease in pre-tax income before net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:    •lower net investment income due to a $106 million decrease in partnership income and a $94 million decrease in valuation gains on ML II, partially offset by $78 million higher call and tender income; and   •higher amortization of DAC and SIA of $75 million related to net realized capital gains in 2010 as compared with net realized capital losses in the same period of 2009.    Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reported a net realized capital gain for the three months ended September 30, 2010 as gains on the sale of securities and a $167 million gain from a legal settlement related to AIG's terminated U.S. securities lending program more than offset other-than-temporary impairment charges and derivative fair value losses. Other-than-temporary impairment charges declined by $383 million from the same period of 2009 and derivative fair value losses on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, which are primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves, decreased by $426 million including the foreign exchange offset by the underlying GIC reserves.  158      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Year-to Date Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reported an increase in pre-tax income before net realized capital losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:    •higher net investment income due to a $659 million increase in partnership income and a $537 million increase in valuation gains on ML II;   •DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $601 million in 2009 primarily due to reductions in the long-term growth assumptions and deteriorated equity market conditions early in 2009 for group retirement products and individual variable annuities. There were no unlockings in the nine-months ended September 30, 2010; and   •Goodwill impairment charges of $81 million in 2009. There were no goodwill impairment charges in the nine-months ended September 30, 2010.    Pre-tax income for Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reflected lower levels of net realized capital losses principally from lower other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.8 billion, the $167 million gain from the legal settlement noted above and increases in net realized capital gains from the sale of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2010. These improvements were partially offset by an increase of $655 million related to derivative fair values losses noted above. In addition, during 2010 Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services recorded $549 million of losses from the change in fair value of embedded derivative liabilities, net of economic hedges, compared to gains of $125 million in 2009. These losses were primarily driven by increases in volatilities in the equity markets and declines in long-term interest rates.   Although there were no unlocking adjustments in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, management expects to complete its annual review of all actuarial estimates and assumptions in the fourth quarter. The review may result in fourth quarter changes in various actuarial assumptions including those pertaining to DAC, reserves and the fair value of certain variable annuity guarantees.

(b)Includes fixed annuity deposits sold through independent life insurance distribution channels.

Life insurance sales increased in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 driven by term and universal life products sold through independent and career distribution networks. Group Retirement deposits increased for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to new product introductions and the resumption of sales in a number of third party sales channels. Individual fixed annuity deposits decreased primarily due to the low interest rate environment in 2010. Variable annuity sales increased due to competitive product enhancements, reinstatements at a number of key broker-dealers, and increased wholesaler productivity. Payout annuity sales increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of improved structured settlement and immediate annuity sales.  160      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Domestic Retirement Services Sales and Deposits  The following table presents the account value rollforward for Domestic Retirement Services:                                   Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Group retirement products                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 62,216    $ 58,381    $ 63,419    $ 56,861        Deposits – annuities      1,232      1,211      3,759      3,550        Deposits – mutual funds      348      314      1,031      1,027              Total Deposits      1,580      1,525      4,790      4,577        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (1,411 )    (1,382 )    (4,827 )    (4,730 )      Death benefits      (74 )    (65 )    (225 )    (194 )            Net inflows (outflows)      95      78      (262 )    (347 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      3,472      4,309      2,626      6,254            Balance, end of period    $ 65,783    $ 62,768    $ 65,783    $ 62,768            Individual fixed annuities                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 47,998    $ 46,124    $ 47,202    $ 48,394        Deposits      896      1,148      3,326      3,434        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (854 )    (1,158 )    (2,651 )    (5,716 )      Death benefits      (371 )    (392 )    (1,133 )    (1,325 )            Net outflows      (329 )    (402 )    (458 )    (3,607 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      478      469      1,403      1,404            Balance, end of period    $ 48,147    $ 46,191    $ 48,147    $ 46,191            Individual variable annuities                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 23,318    $ 22,601    $ 24,637    $ 23,593        Deposits      556      176      1,409      640        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (610 )    (619 )    (1,971 )    (1,972 )      Death benefits      (101 )    (88 )    (327 )    (301 )            Net outflows      (155 )    (531 )    (889 )    (1,633 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      1,881      2,676      1,296      2,786            Balance, end of period    $ 25,044    $ 24,746    $ 25,044    $ 24,746            Total Domestic Retirement Services                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 133,532    $ 127,106    $ 135,258    $ 128,848        Deposits      3,032      2,849      9,525      8,651        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (2,875 )    (3,159 )    (9,449 )    (12,418 )      Death benefits      (546 )    (545 )    (1,685 )    (1,820 )            Net outflows      (389 )    (855 )    (1,609 )    (5,587 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      5,831      7,454      5,325      10,444              Balance, end of year, excluding runoff      138,974      133,705      138,974      133,705        Individual annuities runoff      4,485      4,695      4,485      4,695        GIC runoff      8,478      9,902      8,478      9,902            Balance at end of period    $ 151,937    $ 148,302    $ 151,937    $ 148,302            General and separate account reserves and mutual funds                                General account reserve    $ 97,944    $ 95,817    $ 97,944    $ 95,817        Separate account reserve      45,605      44,225      45,605      44,225            Total general and separate account reserves      143,549      140,042      143,549      140,042        Group retirement mutual funds      8,388      8,260      8,388      8,260            Total reserves and mutual funds    $ 151,937    $ 148,302    $ 151,937    $ 148,302              Surrender rates have improved compared to the prior year for group retirement products, individual fixed annuities and individual variable annuities as surrenders have returned to more normal levels.

Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations    AIG's Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include traditional life insurance, retirement planning, accident and health insurance, as well as savings and investment products for consumers and businesses. The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services products are sold through independent producers, career agents, financial institutions and direct marketing channels.   In managing its Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses). Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) enhances the understanding of the operating performance of the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the table that follows.   Following the classification of ALICO, AIG Star and AIG Edison and Nan Shan as discontinued operations (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), AIG's remaining Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations are conducted primarily through AIA and, to a lesser extent, AIRCO.

The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Premiums and other considerations:                            Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010 vs. 2009   2010 vs. 2009            Increase in original currency*     10.5 %   3.6 %    Foreign exchange effect     4.2     6.8            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars     14.7 %   10.4 %             * Computed using a constant exchange rate each period.    Quarterly Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Premiums and other considerations increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange shown above as well as higher in-force business as a result of improvement in persistency from Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and China. Net investment income was essentially unchanged compared to the same period in 2009, however, excluding policyholder trading gains of $42 million, increased due to higher levels of invested assets and market improvement.   Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains increased significantly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to the factors mentioned above as well as:    •DAC charges in Korea in 2009 due to higher than anticipated surrenders related to a certain product and actuarial charges of $91 million for changes in estimates related to a project to increase standardization of AIG's actuarial systems and processes; and   •the positive effects of the consolidation of a pension trust guaranteed fund under the adoption of the new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2010 on the consolidation of variable interest entities of $67 million.    This improvement was partially offset by an increase in salaries and bonuses, a long-term incentive program provision as well as higher expenses related to strategic systems investments.   Pre-tax income included a decline in net realized capital gains in the Philippines and China.   Year-to-Date Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Premiums and other considerations increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange shown above, higher in-force business as a result of improvement in persistency in key Asian markets and higher sales volumes in the first nine months of 2010. Net investment income decreased compared to the same period in 2009 due to a $1.4 billion decline in policyholder trading gains. Net investment income, excluding policyholder trading gains, increased due to increased holdings in longer dated bonds in Korea, higher dividend income in Thailand and higher invested assets across key Asian markets.   Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains increased significantly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to the factors mentioned above as well as:    •a $134 million loss recognition charge related to the Philippines operations in 2009;   •DAC charges in Korea in 2009 of $91 million noted above;   163      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •the positive effects of the consolidation of a pension trust guaranteed fund under the adoption of the new accounting standard on the consolidation of variable interest entities, tax changes in participating funds and a release in reserves as a result of changes in bonus scale in Singapore totaling $139 million; and   •favorable foreign exchange impact of $64 million.    Pre-tax income included an increase in net realized capital gains and reflected a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges.       Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Sales and Deposits   The following table summarizes first year premium, single premium and annuity deposits for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services:                                                      Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)          Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,              Original Currency       Original Currency     (in millions)   2010   2009   U.S. $   2010   2009   U.S. $            First year premium    $ 475    $ 488      (3 )%    (7 )%  $ 1,302    $ 1,235      5 %    (2 )%    Single premium      227      390      (42 )    (44 )    649      731      (11 )    (15 )    Annuity deposits      46      26      75      67      121      65      86      66              Quarterly Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Sales and Deposits   First year premium sales declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis. Hong Kong benefited from strong savings product sales in the same period of the prior year which became renewal sales in the current period. Australia new business sales returned to normal following the successful acquisition of a few large corporate customers last year, while Korea's first year sales performance was depressed as competition in the direct marketing channel intensified. Traditional life insurance products contributed over 50 percent of first year insurance sales with growing demand for investment-oriented life insurance products as market volatility decreased. Strong first year insurance sales in Singapore with the launch of a popular savings product and Thailand as political unrest stabilized were partially offset by a decline in Hong Kong, Australia and Korea.   Single premium sales declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009. Increased single premium sales in Korea and the Philippines were not sufficient to offset a decline in single premium sales in Singapore which experienced strong single premium sales in same period prior year as market conditions improved.   Annuity deposits increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 due to a successful promotion campaign on fixed annuity deposits in Korea.   Year-to-Date Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Sales and Deposits   First year premium sales increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 on a U.S. dollar basis and declined slightly on an original currency basis as sales continued to focus on traditional life insurance products in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and China as economic growth solidified and broadened across Asian markets. The increase in savings and investment product sales in Hong Kong and Thailand fully offset the declines in Korea due to re-pricing of savings and investment products.   Single premium sales declined in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009. Increased single premium sales in Korea and the Philippines were not sufficient to offset a decline in single premium sales in Singapore which experienced strong single premium sales in the prior year period as market conditions improved.  164      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Annuity deposits increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 due to significantly increased fixed annuity deposits in Korea.       Sales Inducement Assets    AIG offers sales inducements, which include enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contract products. Sales inducements provided to the contractholder are recognized as part of the liability for policyholders' contract deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such amounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC.       Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs    DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment-type products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet with DAC and amortized over the life of the business similar to DAC.       The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC/VOBA:                           Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)   2010   2009            Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services                  Balance at beginning of year    $ 11,098    $ 14,447        Acquisition costs deferred      736      740        Amortization charged to pre-tax income      (786 )    (1,231 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities      (1,649 )    (831 )      Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange      1      (14 )      Other*      -      (1,838 )      Reclassified to Assets held for sale      (4 )    -        Consolidation and eliminations      44      -            Balance at end of period    $ 9,440    $ 11,273            Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services                  Balance at beginning of year    $ 24,792    $ 26,166        Acquisition costs deferred      1,113      1,094        Amortization charged to pre-tax income      (775 )    (851 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities      (92 )    (10 )      Increase due to foreign exchange      226      533        Other      9      (18 )      Activity of discontinued operations      (345 )    608        Reclassified to Assets held for sale      (14,310 )    -            Balance at end of period    $ 10,618    $ 27,522               * In 2009, includes a decrease of $1.3 billion related to the cumulative effect of adopting a new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard and a decrease of $479 million related to the divestiture of the operations in Canada.   As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.  165      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG's DAC and VOBA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG's results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.       Financial Services Operations    AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including commercial aircraft and equipment leasing and capital markets, which are conducted through ILFC and AIGFP. Following the classification of AGF as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2010 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), AIG's remaining consumer finance businesses are now reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Noncore businesses.   As discussed in Note 2, in order to align financial reporting with changes made during the third quarter of 2010 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess performance, changes were made to AIG's segment information. During the third quarter of 2010, AIG's Asset Management group undertook the management responsibilities for non-derivative assets and liabilities of the Capital Markets businesses of the Financial Services segment. These assets and liabilities are being managed on a spread basis, in concert with the Matched Investment Program. Accordingly, gains and losses related to these assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of credit valuation adjustment gains and losses, reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Asset Management — Direct Investment Business. Also, intercompany interest related to loans from AIG Funding Inc. (AIG Funding) to AIGFP is no longer being allocated to Capital Markets from Other operations.   The remaining capital markets derivatives business continues to be reported in the Financial Services segment as part of Capital Markets results.   Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current period presentation for the above changes.       Aircraft Leasing    AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.       Capital Markets    AIGFP engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP has continued to unwind its businesses and portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — Capital Markets Wind-down.   Historically, AIG's Capital Markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. AIGFP has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions.  166      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Financial Services Results        Financial Services results were as follows:                                            Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Revenues:                                            Aircraft Leasing    $ 861    $ 1,284      (33 )%  $ 2,975    $ 3,949    $ (25 )%      Capital Markets      234      1,027      (77 )    149      941      (84 )      Other, including intercompany adjustments      87      95      (8 )    275      467      (41 )          Total    $ 1,182    $ 2,406      (51 )%  $ 3,399    $ 5,357    $ (37 )%          Pre-tax income (loss):                                            Aircraft Leasing    $ (214 )  $ 307      - %  $ (122 )  $ 1,033    $ - %      Capital Markets      148      888      (83 )    (83 )    530      -        Other, including intercompany adjustments      (23 )    (45 )    -      (62 )    (31 )    -            Total    $ (89 )  $ 1,150      - %  $ (267 )  $ 1,532    $ - %            Quarterly Financial Services Results   Financial Services reported a pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to pre-tax income for the same period in 2009 due to the following:    •ILFC reported a pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 as compared to pre-tax income for the same period for 2009 due primarily to impairment charges recorded on aircraft in its fleet. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses of $422 million on certain aircraft in its fleet reflecting management's outlook related to the future recovery of the airline industry due to a decrease in demand for certain aircraft types, increased volatility in fuel costs and changes in other macroeconomic conditions which, when aggregated, resulted in lower future estimated lease rates used in ILFC's annual recurring recoverability assessment. Additionally, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses of $22 million related to aircraft sales and $21 million related to potential aircraft sales. ILFC also incurred increased interest expense driven by higher composite borrowing rates, and an increase in the provision for overhauls to reflect an increase in future reimbursements.   •Capital Markets reported pre-tax income as unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio amounted to $152 million and $959 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The operating results in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 were partially offset by net losses of $63 million and $233 million, respectively, representing the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities.    Year-to-Date Financial Services Results   Financial Services reported a pre-tax loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to pre-tax income for the same period in 2009 due to the following:    •ILFC reported a pre-tax loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to pre-tax income for the same period for 2009 due primarily to impairment charges recorded on aircraft in its fleet. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses of $422 million on certain aircraft in its fleet as noted above. Additionally, ILFC signed agreements to sell 64 aircraft to third parties and recorded asset impairment losses aggregating $409 million, and operating lease related charges aggregating $90 million related to 61 of the 64 aircraft. ILFC also recorded asset impairment losses aggregating $41 million in relation to the potential sales of five aircraft, incurred increased interest   167      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   expense driven by higher composite borrowing rates, and recorded an increase in the provision for overhauls as a result of an adjustment to reflect an increase in future reimbursements.    •Capital Markets reported a pre-tax loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 and pre-tax income for the same period in 2009. Unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio amounted to $432 million and $1.1 billion in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The operating results in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 include net losses of $379 million and net gains of $818 million, respectively, representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of Capital Market's derivative assets and liabilities. The effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of Capital Markets' businesses and portfolios were significantly lower during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.    Quarterly Capital Markets Results   Capital Markets reported lower pre-tax income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Capital Markets reported unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $152 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to unrealized market valuation gains of $959 million for the same period in 2009. The principal components of Capital Markets' valuation gains and losses recognized on its super senior credit default swap portfolio were as follows:    •Capital Markets recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $8 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $566 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 as a result of decreasing corporate spreads in 2009.   •Capital Markets recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $117 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $332 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 reflecting the continued improvement in prices of the underlying assets, which were more substantial in 2009.   •Capital Markets recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $45 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on regulatory capital prime residential mortgage transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one counterparty notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its prime residential mortgage transactions and a related mezzanine transaction. With respect to these two transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transaction early and is required to pay fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final maturity. Because the two regulatory capital transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final legal maturities, there is value to Capital Markets due to the counterparty paying its contractual fees beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through the final maturity date.    See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of Capital Markets' super senior credit default swap portfolio.   During the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, Capital Markets:    •recognized a gain of $108 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio;   168      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •incurred interest charges of $67 million for 2010, relating to intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation, flat with the same period in 2009; and   •incurred a net loss of $97 million (including $34 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps) as compared to a net loss of $318 million (including $85 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps) in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, representing the impact of credit valuation adjustments on Capital Markets' derivative assets and liabilities.    Year-to-Date Capital Markets Results   Capital Markets reported a pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to pre-tax income in the same period in 2009 primarily due to: lower market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio; the significant decrease related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities; partially offset by lower costs related to the continued wind-down of Capital Markets businesses and portfolios.   Capital Markets reported unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio of $432 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to unrealized market valuation gains of $1.1 billion for the same period in 2009. The principal components of Capital Markets valuation gains and losses recognized on the super senior credit default swap portfolio were as follows:    •Capital Markets recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $82 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.7 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 as a result of increasing corporate spreads in 2010 and decreasing corporate spreads in 2009.   •Capital Markets recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $516 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to unrealized market valuation losses of $761 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 driven primarily by price improvement of the underlying assets.   •Capital Markets recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $71 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on regulatory capital prime residential mortgage transactions.    See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of Capital Markets' super senior credit default swap portfolio.   During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, Capital Markets:    •recognized a gain of $111 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio   •incurred interest charges of $201 million for 2010, relating to intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation, flat with the same period in 2009; and   •incurred a net loss of $503 million (including $124 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps) as compared to a gain of $822 million (including $4 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps) in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, representing the impact of credit valuation adjustments on Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities.   169                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Other Operations    AIG's Other operations includes results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, Mortgage Guaranty operations, Asset Management operations, and results from noncore businesses.   AIG's Parent & Other operations consist primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, restructuring costs, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation related charges and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses.   Noncore businesses include results of certain businesses that have been divested or are being wound down or repositioned.   As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in order to align financial reporting with changes made during the third quarter of 2010 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess performance, changes were made to AIG's segment information. Gains and losses related to non-derivative assets and liabilities of the Capital Markets businesses, primarily consisting of credit valuation adjustment gains and losses are reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Asset Management — Direct Investment Business. Also, intercompany interest income related to loans from AIG Funding to AIGFP is no longer being recognized by Parent & Other.   Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current period presentation for the above changes.       Other Results   The following table presents pre-tax income for AIG's Other operations:                                           Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Parent & Other:                                            Intercompany interest income, net    $ 92    $ 168      (45 )%  $ 390    $ 481      (19 )%      Interest expense on FRBNY Credit Facility:                                              Accrued and compounding interest      (120 )    (430 )    -      (526 )    (1,690 )    -          Amortization of prepaid commitment asset      (1,199 )    (822 )    -      (2,381 )    (2,466 )    -              Total interest expense on FRBNY Credit Facility(a)      (1,319 )    (1,252 )    -      (2,907 )    (4,156 )    -        Other interest expense      (461 )    (510 )    -      (1,420 )    (1,536 )    -        Unallocated corporate expenses      (239 )    (128 )    -      (1,043 )    (547 )    -        Restructuring expenses      (113 )    (95 )    -      (250 )    (343 )    -        Change in fair value of ML III(b)      -      -      -      -      (1,401 )    -        Net realized capital gain (loss)      (517 )    (318 )    -      177      737      (76 )      Net (loss) gain on sale of divested businesses      4      (885 )    -      126      (1,192 )    -        Other miscellaneous, net      3      24      (88 )    40      133      (70 )          Total Parent & Other    $ (2,550 )  $ (2,996 )    - %  $ (4,887 )  $ (7,824 )    - %          Other businesses:                                            Mortgage Guaranty    $ (127 )  $ (465 )    - %  $ 214    $ (1,433 )    - %      Asset Management:                                              Direct Investment Business      (85 )    136      -      (114 )    (361 )    -          Institutional Asset Management      (36 )    (917 )    -      (110 )    (1,148 )    -        Noncore businesses      (9 )    16      -      48      117      (59 )      Change in fair value of ML III(b)      301      1,162      (74 )    1,410      1,624      (13 )          Total other businesses    $ 44    $ (68 )    - %  $ 1,448    $ (1,201 )    - %          Total Other operations    $ (2,506 )  $ (3,064 )    - %  $ (3,439 )  $ (9,025 )    - %             (a)Includes interest expense of $135 million and $143 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $407 million and $487 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, allocated to discontinued operations in consolidation. (b)Parent & Other contributed its equity interest in ML III to an AIG subsidiary, reported above in Other businesses, during the second quarter of 2009.  170      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Parent & Other   Parent & Other pre-tax loss decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to the absence of net losses on sales of divested businesses in 2010, partially offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses reflecting a charge recorded in the third quarter of 2010 in connection with the workers compensation matter discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as higher net realized capital losses.   Parent & Other pre-tax loss decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:    •a decline in interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •the absence in 2010 of net losses on sales of divested businesses; and   •the absence in 2010 of losses related to ML III.    This improvement was partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expenses reflecting an increase in securities litigation related charges.  The following table summarizes the net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses:                                   Gain/(loss)          Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009              AIA termination fee    $ -    $ -    $ 228    $ -        Transatlantic      -      (280 )    -      (497 )      21st Century      -      62      -      (408 )      HSB      -      (88 )    -      163        Consumer Finance businesses      -      (158 )    (56 )    (357 )      A.I.

Quarterly Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty reported lower pre-tax losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. This improvement reflected a decline in claim and claims adjustment expenses incurred of $401 million. Domestic first-lien and international businesses reported pre-tax income of $6 million and $27 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2010 while second-lien and private student loans reported pre-tax losses of $91 million and $70 million, respectively. Domestic first-lien and international businesses pre-tax income was $243 million and $130 million higher, respectively, than the three months ended September 30, 2009. Domestic second-lien loss was $14 million lower than the same period in 2009 and the private student loan loss was $56 million higher than the same period in 2009. The improvement in pre-tax income for domestic first-lien, second-lien and international businesses reflects the decline in loss and loss expenses of $287 million for first liens, $27 million for second liens and $144 million for international markets,  171      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  respectively. The increase in the private student loan pre-tax loss is the result of an increase in claim and claims adjustment expenses of $57 million compared to the same period in 2009. The lower claims and claims adjustment expenses include unfavorable prior year development of $26 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to favorable prior year development of $55 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009. The change in prior year development is due primarily to a change in the loss development of the second-lien business during the current quarter. The improved pre-tax results correspond to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien and international products, higher mortgage cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans, higher rescission rates on first-lien claims and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies partially offset by increased delinquencies in private student loans.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has provided services to assist lenders during times of high loan origination activity. In providing these services UGC assumed certain obligations associated with loans on which these services were provided. During the three months ended September 30, 2010 UGC determined that these types of expenses from legacy books of business were increasing and accordingly UGC has increased the provision for these expenses by $30 million to reflect UGC's best estimate of the expected ultimate costs associated with these services. UGC will continue to closely monitor these occurrences and will adjust the provision for these obligations accordingly.       Year-to-Date Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty reported pre-tax income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2009. This improvement reflected a decline in claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred of $2.0 billion, offset in part by lower earned premiums and by an amortization of the second-lien premium deficiency reserve of $222 million in the first quarter of 2009. Domestic first-lien, second-lien and international businesses reported pre-tax income of $116 million, $93 million and $63 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 which was $996 million, $401 million and $262 million higher, respectively, than the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects the decline in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion for first liens, $661 million for second liens and $298 million for international markets. The lower claims and claims adjustment expenses include favorable prior year development of $438 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to unfavorable prior year development of $73 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009. The improved pre-tax results correspond to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher mortgage cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans, higher rescission rates on first-lien claims and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies, partially offset by increased delinquencies in private student loans.   UGC continues to deny claims and rescind coverage on loans (collectively referred to as rescissions) due to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly related to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations have resulted in loan rescissions totaling $286 million of claims on first-lien business during the third quarter of 2010 compared to $146 million during the second quarter of 2010. UGC expects this increased rescission activity to continue during 2010, but at a slowing rate. These rescissions will continue to affect UGC's financial results, but the UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans, consistent with industry practice.   During the third quarter of 2010, foreclosure moratoriums, state attorneys general investigations and new financial regulations occurred which may affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is unclear and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any of these actions individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition.  172      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Risk-in-Force  The following table presents risk in force and delinquency ratio information for UGC's domestic business:                         (dollars in billions)   September 30, 2010   September 30, 2009            Domestic first-lien:                    Risk in force    $ 25.5    $ 26.7        60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a)      17.9 %    16.5 %    Domestic second-lien:                    Risk in force(b)    $ 2.2    $ 2.7               (a)Based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice. (b)Represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties. These claims and counterclaims allege breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud among other allegations.       Dispositions   In December 2009, UGC entered into two stock purchase agreements for the sale of its Canadian and Israel operations. The Israel transaction closed on January 21, 2010 and the Canadian transaction closed on April 16, 2010.   Change in Fair Value of ML III   Gains on ML III for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 were $301 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. The $301 million gain was attributable to the shortening of weighted average life by 1.54 years. Additionally, fair values for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 were positively affected by a decrease in projected credit losses in the underlying collateral securities.   For the three months ended September 30, 2010, credit spreads tightened by 29 basis points which resulted in an overall narrowing of credit spreads by 114 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.   Asset Management Operations   AIG's Asset Management operations include the results of the Direct Investment businesses and the Institutional Asset Management businesses, which includes AIG's internal asset management business and AIG Markets. AIG Markets acts as a derivative intermediary transacting with AIG and its subsidiaries and the third parties.   On March 26, 2010, AIG completed the sale of its third party asset management business. The results of operations from January 1 through the closing of the sale are included in the Institutional Asset Management results. Subsequent to the sale of AIG's third party asset management business, the revenues of the Institutional Asset Management business are derived from providing asset management services to AIG and its subsidiaries. The Direct Investment businesses' operating results are impacted by performance in the credit, equity and real estate markets.       Direct Investment Business Results   The Direct Investment business includes results for the Matched Investment Program, AIG Global Real Estate and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of Capital Markets now managed by the Asset Management Group.   The Direct Investment businesses recognized pre-tax losses in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 driven by foreign exchange losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, the negative impact of AIG's narrowing credit spread on the valuation of liabilities as well as impairments on real estate investments.  173      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Also contributing to the loss was the discontinuation of hedge accounting early in 2010. Economic hedging relationships are being retained despite the discontinuation of hedge accounting. Partially offsetting these negative drivers was the positive impact of improved asset values of fixed income trading securities and debt defeasance gains in the Global Real Estate portfolio.       The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the Direct Investment business (excluding intercompany transactions):                            (in millions)                 Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       Three Months Ended September 30, 2010                      Bond trading securities    $ 276    Notes and bonds payable    $ (96 )    Loans and other assets      8    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      (116 )              GIAs      (114 )              Other liabilities      (16 )              Increase in assets    $ 284    Increase in liabilities    $ (342 )              Net pre-tax decrease to Other income    $ (58 )                    Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                      Bond trading securities   $ 1,627    Notes and bonds payable   $ (281 )    Loans and other assets     19    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     (252 )              GIAs     (105 )              Other liabilities     (45 )              Increase in assets   $ 1,646    Increase in liabilities   $ (683 )              Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 963                        The Direct Investment business pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 includes a net loss representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The net loss was primarily the result of the tightening of AIG's credit spreads during the quarter, partially offset by the continued tightening of credit spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs.   The Direct Investment business pre-tax income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The gain in the third quarter of 2009 was primarily the result of the tightening of credit spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, partially offset by the narrowing of AIG's credit spreads.  174      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the Direct Investment business (excluding intercompany transactions):                            (in millions)                 Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010                      Bond trading securities    $ 1,346    Notes and bonds payable    $ (219 )    Loans and other assets      53    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      (280 )              GIAs      (193 )              Other liabilities      (40 )              Increase in assets    $ 1,399    Increase in liabilities    $ (732 )              Net pre-tax increase to Other income    $ 667                      Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                      Bond trading securities   $ 1,365    Notes and bonds payable   $ (34 )    Loans and other assets     (43 )  Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     59                GIAs     214                Other liabilities     12                Increase in assets   $ 1,322    Decrease in liabilities   $ 251                Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 1,573                        The Direct Investment business pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The gain was primarily the result of the tightening of credit spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, partially offset by the tightening of AIG's credit spreads.   The Direct Investment business pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The gain in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 was primarily the result of the tightening of credit spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs.       Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management recognized a pre-tax loss in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 driven by operating expenses which exceeded asset management fees as well as the sale and deconsolidation of the operating results of AIG's third party asset management business and certain previously consolidated private equity investments. Also contributing to the current quarter operating losses is the negative impact of AIG's narrowing credit spreads on the valuation of derivative liabilities held through AIG Markets. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, losses were driven by impairment charges related to proprietary investment originally acquired for warehouse purposes as well as goodwill impairment charges.   Noncore Businesses   Noncore businesses include the operating results of divested businesses through the date of their sale.   Following the classification of AGF as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2010 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), AIG's remaining consumer finance businesses are now reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Noncore businesses.   At September 30, 2010, the remaining consumer finance operations were conducted in Poland and India. During the first nine months of 2010, AIG completed the sale of consumer finance operations in Argentina, Colombia, Taiwan and its banking business in Poland. In October 2010, AIG completed the sale of its consumer finance operations in India.       Critical Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent  175      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:    •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;   •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and flight equipment;   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;   •impairment changes, including other-than-temporary impairments and goodwill impairment;   •liabilities for legal contingencies;   •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of deferred tax assets;   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps (CDS) and AIG's economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III;   •classification of entities as held for sale or as discontinued operations;   •fair value of the assets and liabilities, including non-controlling interests, related to acquisitions; and   •AIG's ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of going concern considerations.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. Following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2010. For a complete discussion of AIG's accounting estimates, see the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Goodwill Impairment:   Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.   The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.   Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG's reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit's fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit's peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. As part of the impairment test, management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all of AIG's reporting units with AIG's market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values.   If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess.   In connection with the announced sale of ALICO on March 7, 2010 and management's decision that ALICO met the held-for-sale criteria on March 31, 2010, total goodwill of $4.6 billion associated with the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Japan operating segment through that date was allocated among ALICO and AIG Star and AIG Edison based on their relative fair values as of March 31, 2010. This resulted in $3.3 billion and $1.3 billion of goodwill being allocated to ALICO and the AIG Star and AIG Edison reporting units,  176      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  respectively for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairment. Management tested goodwill for impairment in both reporting units and determined the fair values of ALICO and AIG Star and AIG Edison exceeded book value at March 31, 2010, by 1 percent and 51 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired.   The fair value of ALICO used to test goodwill for impairment at March 31, 2010 was determined by AIG by considering, among other information, a third-party valuation at March 31, 2010 of the announced proceeds from the sale of ALICO to MetLife. Given the significance of the equity component of the consideration, the fair value of ALICO is sensitive to the market value and volatility of MetLife common stock, the risk-free interest rate yield curve and discount rate assumptions used in estimating fair value. Because the market value of MetLife's common stock declined 13 percent at June 30, 2010 compared with March 31, 2010, AIG updated its goodwill impairment test for ALICO. At June 30, 2010, AIG estimated the fair value of ALICO and determined the fair value of ALICO to be less than its carrying value. Accordingly, AIG performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to ALICO by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of ALICO over the amounts that would be assigned to ALICO's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, AIG determined that all of the goodwill allocated to ALICO should be impaired and, accordingly, recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2010.   In connection with the announced sale of the AIG Star and AIG Edison reporting unit (Reporting Unit) on September 29, 2010 and management's determination that the Reporting Unit met the held-for-sale criteria, management tested the $1.3 billion of goodwill of the Reporting Unit for impairment. At September 30, 2010, AIG estimated the fair value of the Reporting Unit based on the consideration to be received pursuant to the agreement with Prudential Financial Inc. and determined the fair value to be less than its carrying value. Accordingly, AIG performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to the Reporting Unit by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the Reporting Unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the Reporting Unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, AIG determined that all of the goodwill allocated to the Reporting Unit should be impaired and, accordingly, recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2010.       Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets:   At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, AIG had a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $1.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized (a likelihood of more than 50 percent). Realization of AIG's net deferred tax asset depends upon its ability to generate gains on asset sales, including from the recently completed initial public offering of AIA, future sales of AIA ordinary shares held by AIG and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset. However, the realization of the net deferred tax assets does not depend on projected future operating income for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group.   When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax asset at September 30, 2010, AIG considered all available evidence, including:    •the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses;   •certain transactions, including the recognition of the gains on asset sales, and the initial public offering of AIA;   •the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards; and   •tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset.    Estimates of future gains generated from specific transactions and tax planning strategies could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either  177      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  positive or negative, could be material to AIG's consolidated financial condition or its results of operations for an individual reporting period.   When estimating the fair values of the subsidiaries to be divested, AIG considered, among other information, valuations prepared for various purposes. During the first quarter of 2010, AIG increased its estimate of the AIA and ALICO expected divestiture proceeds following an updated assessment of the range of valuation estimates that considered, among other factors, the expected proceeds from the sales to Prudential plc and MetLife, Inc. announced in that quarter, which gave rise to a $910 million reduction in the valuation allowance. During the third quarter, based on the expectation of lower proceeds from the sale of AIA ordinary shares, the realization amount of the deferred tax assets was reduced by increasing valuation allowance of $1.3 billion.       U.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries:   Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between book carrying value and tax basis of subsidiaries, as well as the level of judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.       Measurement of the Fair Values of the Assets Acquired, Liabilities Assumed, and Noncontrolling Interests of Fuji   On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Chartis International subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji. The acquisition of the additional voting shares for $145 million increased Chartis' total voting ownership interest in Fuji from 41.7 percent to 54.8 percent, which resulted in Chartis obtaining control of Fuji.   Because the acquisition was completed on the last day of the quarter, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when AIG issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The initial purchase price allocation was based on the information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests of Fuji as of the acquisition date. Fuji's financial information is reported to Chartis on a quarter lag. As such, Chartis was awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date. Furthermore, at the time, Chartis had not obtained final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate or intangible assets.   During the quarter ended June 30, 2010, Chartis International obtained the additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date including final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate or intangible assets and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, adjustments to the previously reported purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2010 occurred as a result of new information that became known about market conditions in the life insurance industry in Japan that existed as of the acquisition date which, if known, would have reduced the amount recognized by Chartis International as of that date for the fair value of the business acquired (VOBA) of Fuji's life insurance subsidiary by approximately $132 million. Public announcements of capital raising initiatives during this period in response to new regulatory solvency rules announced by the Japanese regulator prior to the acquisition date but not yet adopted indicated that market participants are managing to the target solvency margin ratios under the new solvency margin rules instead of the current solvency margin rules. As a result, Chartis International revised its target capital assumption in its VOBA calculation based on the new standard. In addition, Chartis International increased the previously reported purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2010 by approximately $11 million as a result of new information received during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 regarding certain assets and liabilities of Fuji. Additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2010 may occur if new information becomes known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date.  178                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $332 million, which is included in Other Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). AIG will retrospectively revise its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 when presenting comparative financial information containing that period. The bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of Fuji's common stock, which AIG believes is the result of macro-economic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fuji's financial condition and results of operations. AIG anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the Fuji shares.

Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview   The following table presents the fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination:                        At September 30, 2010 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 316     92 %    Fair value based on internal sources     26     8            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)   $ 342     100 %             (a)Includes $30 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes. (b)Includes available for sale and trading securities.    See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.       Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability.   At September 30, 2010, AIG classified $38.9 billion and $11.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.5 percent and 1.5 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at September 30, 2010. At December 31, 2009, AIG classified $38.9 billion and $13.9 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.6 percent and 1.9 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.   Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.  179      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    AIG values its assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3.   Private equity and real estate fund investments: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price, i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset. Subsequently, they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. AIG considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement.   Corporate bonds and private placement debt: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued using market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads). When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models using yield curves observed from indices or credit default swap spreads.   Certain RMBS and CMBS: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles considering remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations, or discounted cash flow techniques.   Certain ABS — non-mortgage: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued based on external price/spread data. When position-specific external price data are not observable, the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities.   CDOs: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued based on external price/spread data from independent third parties, dealer quotations, matrix pricing, the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model or a combination of these methods.   Interests in the Maiden Lane Interests: At their inception, ML II and ML III were valued at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. Subsequently, Maiden Lane Interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the Maiden Lane Interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool. The implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with AIG's interests in the capital structure of the respective entities. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.   The fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the Maiden Lane Interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of the Maiden Lane Interests. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.   Refer to Note 5 for sensitivity analysis disclosures with respect to the Maiden Lane Interests.   Capital Markets Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  180      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class:                                                               Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss)                  Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at          Net Notional Amount    Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          September 30, 2010(a)   December 31, 2009(a)   September 30, 2010(b)(c)   December 31, 2009(b)(c)     (in millions)   2010(c)   2009(c)   2010(c)   2009(c)            Regulatory Capital:                                                        Corporate loans    $ 28,592    $ 55,010    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -        Prime residential mortgages      35,455      93,276      (208 )    (137 )    45      -      71      -        Other      1,403      1,760      22      21      6      16      (1 )    25              Total      65,450      150,046      (186 )    (116 )    51      16      70      25            Arbitrage:                                                        Multi-sector CDOs(d)      6,929      7,926      3,640      4,418      117      332      516      (761 )      Corporate debt/CLOs(e)      12,512      22,076      308      309      8      566      (82 )    1,716              Total      19,441      30,002      3,948      4,727      125      898      434      955            Mezzanine tranches(f)      2,880      3,478      215      143      (24 )    45      (72 )    163            Total    $ 87,771    $ 183,526    $ 3,977    $ 4,754    $ 152    $ 959    $ 432    $ 1,143               (a)Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

(d)During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, AIGFP terminated a super senior CDS transaction with its counterparty with a net notional amount of $296 million, included in Multi-sector CDOs. This transaction was terminated at approximately its fair value at the time of the termination. As a result, a $202 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, AIGFP also paid $60 million to its counterparty with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, a $60 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Multi-sector CDOs also includes $5.6 billion and $6.3 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. (e)During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, AIGFP terminated super senior CDS transactions with its counterparties with a net notional amount of $9.3 billion, included in Corporate debt/CLOs.

Through October 29, 2010, AIGFP had also received termination notices with respect to an additional $16.1 billion in net notional amount with an effective termination date in 2010. AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of September 30, 2010, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 2.18 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of Basel I that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by Basel II. It was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from Basel I to Basel II by the end of the two-year adoption period on December 31, 2009, after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these CDS transactions, except in a small number of specific instances. However, in 2009, the Basel Committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the Basel I capital floors beyond the end of 2009, although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various European Central Banking districts. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio increased as of September 30, 2010 by approximately 0.8 years from December 31, 2009 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of $16.6 billion. Where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the Basel I extension will be effective. Where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early, AIGFP has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits as a result of the extension of the Basel I capital floor announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions.   Included in the Regulatory Capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its Prime Residential Mortgage transactions and a related mezzanine transaction with a combined net notional amount of $26.8 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010. With respect to these transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay AIG fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity. Since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities, there is value to AIGFP representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through to the final contractual maturity date. The fair value of these two super senior transactions as of September 30, 2010 was a derivative asset of $208 million. With respect to these two transactions, AIGFP has also written CDS transactions on the mezzanine tranches of these portfolios; however, the majority of the transactions on the mezzanine tranches were hedged by AIGFP with other third party CDS transactions.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 other than (1) for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and (2) for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.  183      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents, for each of the regulatory capital CDS transactions in the corporate loan portfolio, the gross transaction notional amount, net notional amount, attachment points, inception to date realized losses and percent non-investment grade:                                    (dollars in millions)  CDS   Gross Transaction Notional Amount at September 30, 2010   Net Notional Amount at September 30, 2010   Attachment Point at Inception(a)   Attachment Point at September 30, 2010(a)   Realized Losses through September 30, 2010(b)   Percent Non-investment Grade at September 30, 2010(c)            1   $ 443   $ 346     10.03%     21.94%     0.52%     28.75%      2     1,523     1,282     10.00%     15.85%     0.16%     28.82%      3(d)     7,920     7,005     11.00%     11.55%     0.00%     9.40%      4     258     13     18.00%     95.03%     0.00%     73.60%      5(e)     10,227     9,048     10.80%     11.52%     0.00%     7.94%      6     5,046     4,450     11.00%     11.79%     0.09%     12.97%      7     3,298     2,776     13.26%     15.83%     0.00%     70.16%      8     2,357     1,960     15.85%     16.82%     0.00%     11.67%      9     796     328     14.00%     40.63%     0.16%     33.28%      10     615     288     14.00%     40.63%     0.16%     33.28%      11     1,471     1,096     14.00%     40.63%     0.16%     33.28%                Total   $ 33,954   $ 28,592                                                               (a)Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to Capital Markets for such referenced pools.   All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP . In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In virtually all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for a significant majority of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIG receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower, notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. For example, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values, and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. The two pools containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 35.00 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The average number of loans in each pool is over 4,200. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. These transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at September 30, 2010. Three other pools, with a total net notional amount of $1.7 billion, have non-investment grade percentages greater than  185      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  30.00 percent, each with a remaining life to maturity of 15.5 years. These pools have realized losses of 0.16 percent from inception through September 30, 2010 and have current weighted average attachment points of 40.63 percent. Approximately 0.83 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 0.00 percent to 3.78 percent.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.   Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on approximately 96.11 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.11 percent to 2.62 percent, averaging 0.73 percent. Except for one transaction, which comprised less than 1.25 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.25 percent and ranged from 0.00 percent to 5.34 percent. The default rate on this one transaction was 18.81 percent with a subordination level of 49.66 percent.   For all regulatory capital transactions, where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses, and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers, and information available from rating agencies, governments, and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will continue to terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.  186      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the Capital Markets Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans portfolio by geographic location:                                                                                                              Weighted Average Maturity (Years)         Ratings of Junior Tranches(d)   At September 30, 2010   Exposure Portfolio   Net Notional Amount (in millions)       Current Average Attachment Point(a)   Realized Losses through September 30, 2010(b)         Percent of Total   To First Call(c)   To Maturity   Number of Transactions   Percent Rated   Average Rating                                                            Primarily Single Country:                                                    Germany   $ 4,404     15.40 %   16.35 %   0.09 % 1.99   8.53   3     100 % A+        Finland     13     0.05 %   95.03 %   -   0.04   4.29   1     100   AAA                                                          Subtotal Single Country     4,417     15.45 %   20.03 %   0.08 % 1.90   8.33   4     100   A+                                                            Regional:                                                    Asia     1,960     6.85 %   16.82 %   -   0.25   1.50   1     100   AAA        Europe     22,215     77.70 %   14.80 %   0.06 % 0.13   1.98   6     100   AA                                                             Subtotal Regional     24,175     84.55 %   14.97 %   0.05 % 0.14   1.94   7     100   AA                                                            Total   $ 28,592     100.00 %   15.79 %   0.06 % 0.43   2.98   11     100   AA                                                                (a)Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

In certain cases, simultaneously with the exercise of the 2a-7 Puts by AIGFP's counterparties, AIGFP accessed financing arrangements previously entered into with such counterparties, pursuant to which the counterparties remained the legal owners of the underlying CDO securities. However, these securities were reported as part of the Capital Markets investment portfolio as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Most of these underlying CDO securities were later acquired by ML III from' AIGFP's counterparties.

In a number of instances, the level of subordination with respect to individual CDOs has increased since inception relative to the overall size of the CDO. While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

Collateral   Most of the Capital Markets credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.   Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of September 30, 2010, 55.2 percent of the Capital Markets regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) linked to AIG's credit rating and 44.8 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreement (Master Agreement) or similar agreement, under which the aggregate Exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty, and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans, or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.  Expected Loss Models — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.   191      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Negotiated Amount — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   The following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than the Capital Markets super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended:                           (in millions)   December 31, 2009   September 30, 2010   October 29, 2010            Reference to market indices   $ 60   $ 32   $ 22      Expected loss models     20     -     -      Negotiated amount     230     246     239            Total   $ 310   $ 278   $ 261              Arbitrage Portfolio — Multi-Sector CDOs   In the CDS transactions, with physical settlement provisions, in respect of multi-sector CDOs, the standard CSA provisions for the calculation of Exposure have been modified, with the Exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying CDO security, rather than the replacement value of the transaction. As of any date, the "market value" of the relevant CDO security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such CDO security in a market transaction on such date, while the "replacement value of the transaction" is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation (e.g., the CDO security). In cases where a formula is utilized, a transaction-specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of Exposure, which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted. These thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of AIG and/or the reference obligations, with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings. For the large majority of counterparties to these transactions, the Master Agreement and CSA cover non-CDS transactions (e.g., interest rate and cross currency swap transactions) as well as CDS transactions. As a result, the amount of collateral to be posted by AIGFP in relation to the CDS transactions will be added to or offset by the amount, if any, of the Exposure AIG has to the counterparty on the non-CDS transactions.   Arbitrage Portfolio — Corporate Debt/CLOs   All of the Capital Markets corporate arbitrage transactions are subject to CSAs. None of these transactions (measured by net notional amount) contains a special collateral posting provision, but each is subject to a Master Agreement that includes a CSA. These transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same Master Agreement and CSA, with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard CSA procedures outlined above. None of these transactions, although subject to a Master Agreement and CSA, has specific valuation and threshold provisions.   Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.   From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFP's estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels,  192      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences, including at the present time. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                           (in millions)   December 31, 2009   September 30, 2010   October 29, 2010            Regulatory capital   $ 310   $ 278   $ 261      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO     3,715     3,162     3,086      Arbitrage – corporate     565     496     427            Total   $ 4,590   $ 3,936   $ 3,774              The amount of future collateral posting requirements generally is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the severe market disruption, lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future.   Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio   Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased 0.90 percent, 1.61 percent and 1.45 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first, second and third quarters of 2010. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $6.9 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at September 30, 2010, a BET value is available for $4.2 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $2.7 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $4.2 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market  193      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at September 30, 2010 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                            Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at September 30, 2010         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS PRIME   RMBS ALT-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     44 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (279 ) $ (8 ) $ (27 ) $ (121 ) $ (77 ) $ (31 ) $ (15 )             Decrease of 5 points     268     11     26     113     80     16     22              Weighted average life     6.37 years   Increase of 1 year     37     —     3     28     3     2     1               Decrease of 1 year     (63 )   (1 )   (4 )   (50 )   (4 )   (3 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     21%   Increase of 10%     (42 )   -     (4 )   (14 )   (21 )   (1 )   (2 )             Decrease of 10%     36     1     5     12     17     1     -              Diversity score(a)     12   Increase of 5     (6 )                                                 Decrease of 5     23                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     26                                                   (a)The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  195      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries         Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: General Insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment business. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance & retirement services companies, as well as in the Direct Investment business, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the Commercial Insurance Group historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the Commercial Insurance Group's current risk/return and tax objectives, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by Foreign General Insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk, and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not fair value its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At September 30, 2010, approximately 73 percent of the fixed maturity securities were in domestic entities. Approximately 29 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 11 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspectives for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2010, approximately 13 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 44 percent of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  196      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG's fixed maturity investments:                             September 30, 2010*   December 31, 2009            Rating:                    AAA      24 %    23 %      AA      17      24        A      26      28        BBB      22      17        Below investment grade      8      6        Non-rated      3      2            Total      100 %    100 %             *Excludes fixed maturity securities of businesses held for sale as of September 30, 2010.  197                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Available for Sale Investments  The following table presents the amortized cost or cost and fair value of AIG's available for sale securities:                                   (in millions)   Amortized Cost or Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Other-Than- Temporary Impairments in AOCI(a)            September 30, 2010                                    Bonds available for sale:                                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities    $ 7,323   $ 316   $ (1 ) $ 7,638   $ -        Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions      46,136     3,320     (100 )   49,356     (30 )      Non-U.S. governments      39,219     3,816     (65 )   42,970     -        Corporate debt      138,276     14,753     (997 )   152,032     95        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                                        RMBS      31,916     1,183     (2,073 )   31,026     (850 )        CMBS      7,905     263     (1,562 )   6,606     (359 )        CDO/ABS      7,029     409     (868 )   6,570     (33 )            Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized      46,850     1,855     (4,503 )   44,202     (1,242 )          Total bonds available for sale(b)      277,804     24,060     (5,666 )   296,198     (1,177 )    Equity securities available for sale:                                      Common stock      5,359     3,792     (150 )   9,001     -        Preferred stock      475     123     (3 )   595     -        Mutual funds      1,555     176     (61 )   1,670     -            Total equity securities available for sale      7,389     4,091     (214 )   11,266     -            Total(c)    $ 285,193   $ 28,151   $ (5,880 ) $ 307,464   $ (1,177 )          December 31, 2009                                    Bonds available for sale:                                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities   $ 5,098   $ 174   $ (49 ) $ 5,223   $ -        Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions     52,324     2,163     (385 )   54,102     -        Non-U.S. governments     63,080     3,153     (649 )   65,584     (1 )      Corporate debt     185,188     10,826     (3,876 )   192,138     119        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                                        RMBS     32,173     991     (4,840 )   28,324     (2,121 )        CMBS     18,717     195     (5,623 )   13,289     (739 )        CDO/ABS     7,911     284     (1,304 )   6,891     (63 )            Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized     58,801     1,470     (11,767 )   48,504     (2,923 )          Total bonds available for sale(b)     364,491     17,786     (16,726 )   365,551     (2,805 )    Equity securities available for sale:                                      Common stock     4,460     2,913     (75 )   7,298     -        Preferred stock     740     94     (20 )   814     -        Mutual funds     1,264     182     (36 )   1,410     -            Total equity securities available for sale     6,464     3,189     (131 )   9,522     -            Total(c)   $ 370,955   $ 20,975   $ (16,857 ) $ 375,073   $ (2,805 )             (a) Represents the amount of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income, which, starting on April 1, 2009, were not included in earnings.

Although the market value has improved and CMBS spreads have tightened during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, the market value of the holdings continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.  203      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Investments in CDOs   The following table presents AIG's CDO investments by collateral type:                                                     September 30, 2010    December 31, 2009      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Collateral Type:                                                                    Bank loans (CLO)    $ 1,828    $ 66    $ (471 )  $ 1,423      73 %  $ 2,015    $ 63    $ (596 )  $ 1,482      66 %      Synthetic investment grade      113      82      (5 )    190      5      220      83      (21 )    282      8        Other      530      129      (71 )    588      21      772      74      (107 )    739      25        Subprime ABS      24      1      (13 )    12      1      33      1      (27 )    7      1            Total    $ 2,495    $ 278    $ (560 )  $ 2,213      100 %  $ 3,040    $ 221    $ (751 )  $ 2,510      100 %           The following table presents AIG's CDO investments by credit rating:                                                     September 30, 2010    December 31, 2009      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Rating:                                                                    AAA    $ 46    $ 3    $ (3 )  $ 46      2 %  $ 326    $ 5    $ (42 )  $ 289      11 %      AA      116      -      (12 )    104      5      135      1      (29 )    107      4        A      548      19      (129 )    438      22      1,028      22      (311 )    739      34        BBB      877      17      (258 )    636      35      670      19      (214 )    475      22        Below investment grade      907      228      (158 )    977      36      879      155      (155 )    879      29        Non-rated      1      11      -      12      -      2      19      -      21      -            Total    $ 2,495    $ 278    $ (560 )  $ 2,213      100 %  $ 3,040    $ 221    $ (751 )  $ 2,510      100 %                Commercial Mortgage Loans   At September 30, 2010, AIG had direct U.S. commercial mortgage loan exposure of $14.1 billion.

AIG has recognized the other-than-temporary impairment charges (severity losses) shown above in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. With the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard on April 1, 2009, such severity loss charges subsequent to that date exclusively related to equity securities and other invested assets. In all prior periods, such charges primarily related to mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized securities, corporate debt securities of financial institutions and other equity securities. Notwithstanding AIG's intent and ability to hold such securities until they had recovered their cost or amortized cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that  208      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.   Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.   In addition to the above severity losses, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 related to:    •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments and private equity investments.    During the third quarter of 2010, AIG recognized $340 million in other than temporary impairment charges, primarily due to changes in intent to sell certain mortgage-backed securities.   With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.10 percent and 0.20 percent of Total equity in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $94 million and $54 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $315 million and $519 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $18.3 billion reflecting an increase in fair value primarily due to the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of September 30, 2010, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for more than 12 months, comprising the unrealized loss of $1.5 billion related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 119 securities with an amortized cost of $1.1 billion and a net unrealized loss of $746 million, are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. Current market spreads continue to be significantly wider for securities supported by real estate related assets, compared to spreads at the securities' respective purchase dates, largely due to the continued effects of the recession and the economic and market uncertainties regarding future performance of commercial and residential real estate. In addition, declining LIBOR rates have made floating rate securities less attractive as a class.   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based  210      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.   See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Regulation    Directive 2002/87/EC (Directive) issued by the European Parliament provides that certain financial conglomerates with regulated entities in the European Union are subject to supplementary supervision. Pursuant to the Directive, the Commission Bancaire (the French banking regulator) was appointed as AIG's supervisory coordinator. From February 2007 until March 2010, with the approval of the Commission Bancaire, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) acted as AIG's equivalent supervisor, as permitted by the Directive in circumstances in which a financial conglomerate organized outside the European Union (such as AIG) has proposed to have one of its existing regulators recognized as its coordinator and such regulator's supervision is determined to be equivalent to that required by the Directive. Since March 2010, AIG has been in discussions with, and has provided information to the Commission Bancaire regarding the possibility of proposing another of AIG's existing regulators as its equivalent supervisor.   On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject AIG to substantial additional federal regulation, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank is intended to enhance the safety and soundness of U.S. financial institutions and increase public confidence in them. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years. AIG cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally; impact AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition; or require AIG to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of AIG's credit ratings.   Key aspects identified to date of Dodd-Frank's potential impact on AIG include:    •The new legislation provides two scenarios under which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) could become AIG's regulator: (1) if AIG is recognized as a "savings and loan holding company" as defined by the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) and/or (2) if the newly created risk regulator — the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) — designates AIG as a company whose material financial distress, or whose nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness or mix of activities, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.   •If AIG becomes subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB, the FRB would have authority to impose capital requirements on AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to insurance-based organizations, nor can AIG predict how the FRB will exercise potential general supervisory authority over AIG as to its business practices or those of its subsidiaries. If designated as a Designated Financial Company, AIG would become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress.   •Under either scenario, AIG may become subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB in consultation with the newly created Federal Insurance Office (discussed below) to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, AIG has the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. AIG cannot predict how the stress tests will be designed or conducted or whether the results thereof will   211      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   cause AIG to alter its business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors about AIG's financial strength.    •The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that AIG and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.   •If AIG is considered a banking entity for purposes of the "Volcker Rule" AIG would become subject to the provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the rule's exceptions, "proprietary trading" and the sponsorship of, or investment in, hedge, private equity or similar funds.   •Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, upon a determination (with the approval of the director of the Federal Insurance Office if — as is true with respect to AIG — the largest United States subsidiary is an insurer) that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability.   •Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets and certain market participants which could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries, as well as Capital Markets.   •Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury to be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office would perform various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council and participating in the Council's decisions regarding insurers (potentially including AIG), to be designated for stricter regulation. The director would also be required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. The FIO may recommend enhanced regulations to the states.   •Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a savings and loan holding company or a Designated Financial Company to place its financial activities in an intermediate holding company separate from non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes restrictions on transactions between the two businesses, which could be burdensome and costly to implement.   •Dodd-Frank establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. The BCFP will have significant authority to implement and enforce Federal consumer financial laws, including the new protections established under Dodd-Frank, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices. In addition, the BCFP will have broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over certain consumer products, such as mortgage lending. Insurance products and services are not within the BCFP's general jurisdiction, and broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the BCFP's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.   •Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan. These changes may adversely affect AGF's or UGC's business.   •Dodd-Frank seeks to increase efficiency, reduce transaction costs and improve consumer access in the nonadmitted property and casualty insurance market (excess and surplus lines) and to reform the regulation of the reinsurance markets. AIG expects that these measures will make Lexington's operations more streamlined and efficient, although they could lead to greater competition in these markets.   212      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect AIG's business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith, including:     •The SEC is required to conduct a study and may impose on registered broker-dealers who provide to retail investors personalized investment advice a new standard of conduct the same as or similar to the overall standard for investment advisers (i.e. a fiduciary standard). The SEC may also require broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products to make certain disclosures and obtain customer consents or acknowledgements.   •The SEC and other regulators are required to promulgate regulations requiring the originator of certain asset-backed securities to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of securities sold, which may apply to activities of subsidiaries of AIG as part of their funding activities in the future.     Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including (as applicable to AIG) ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by AIG into state guaranty funds). AIG cannot predict the potential effects the new legislation will have on its organizational structure, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse.   Foreign governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject AIG to substantial additional regulation.   In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and exploring steps to avoid similar problems in the future. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. These proposals address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which AIG's subsidiaries conduct business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims.   AIG cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings.   For additional information concerning the regulation of AIG and its businesses, see Item 1. Business — Regulation in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Risk Management    For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The disclosure in this section includes risk exposures to AIA, ALICO, AGF, AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan, because the sales of these companies had not yet been concluded as of September 30, 2010. Subsequent to these dispositions, AIG's consolidated exposures, including credit, interest rates, equities and currencies, will be reduced significantly.  213      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Credit Risk Management    AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark-to-market), deposits and letters of credit (both in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity:                         At September 30, 2010 Category   Risk Rating(a)   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity            Investment Grade:                    10 largest combined     A- (b)   123.9 %(c)      Single largest non-sovereign (financial institution)     BBB-     8.3        Single largest corporate     AA     3.3        Single largest sovereign     AAA     30.1      Non-Investment Grade:                    Single largest sovereign     BB-     2.1        Single largest non-sovereign     BB     0.8               (a)Reflects AIG's internal risk ratings.  (b) Five of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions and five are to investment-grade rated sovereigns. Based on support from the US Government, the exposure to government-sponsored entities (GSEs) and to mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the GSEs is included in the US Government total, rather than in financial institutions. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB- or its equivalent.  (c) Exposure to the ten largest combined as a percentage of Total equity was 102.8 percent at December 31, 2009.   AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Nine countries have cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, as of September 30, 2010, six countries were rated AAA and three were rated AA. The two largest cross-border exposures are to Bermuda and the United Kingdom.   In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG's single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms and insurance and reinsurance companies.  214      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity:                      At September 30, 2010   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity            Industry Category:              Money Center / Global Bank Groups     74.6 %*      European Regional Financial Institutions     12.7        Global Life Insurance Companies     11.9        Global Reinsurance Companies     11.6        Asian Regional Financial Institutions     9.9        Supranational Banks     7.8        Global Securities Companies     6.5        North American Based Regional Financial Institutions     6.5               *Exposure to Money Center/Global Bank Groups as a percentage of Total equity was 83.9 percent at December 31, 2009.   AIG's exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 32.0 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2010 compared to 33.5 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2009.   AIG also has a risk concentration through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG holds approximately $46.7 billion of tax-exempt and taxable securities, $6.0 billion of which are defeased, issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories. A majority of these securities are held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property-casualty insurance companies. These securities are comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The average credit quality of these issuers is A.   Currently, several states, local governments and other issuers are facing pressures on their budgets from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG's portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the major nationally recognized statistical rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers is the State of California, of which AIG holds approximately $770.8 million of general obligation bonds, $44.9 million of which are defeased. Nevertheless, despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does not expect any significant defaults in portfolio holdings of municipal issuers over the near term.   AIG has credit exposure to several sovereign governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed on review in recent months by one or more major rating agencies. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits and rising government debt to GDP ratios. As of September 30, 2010, AIG had exposure of $1.0 billion to the government of Greece, which has been downgraded to below investment grade by two major rating agencies. At September 30, 2010, AIG's exposure to certain other European governments, such as Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Hungary, amounted to $2.1 billion. Four of these five governments have experienced rating downgrades during the first nine months of 2010.   With the closing of the ALICO sale on November 1, 2010, the exposure to the government of Greece was reduced to zero. With the closing of the ALICO sale and the public offering and related deconsolidation of AIA on October 29, 2010, AIG's exposure to the other European governments referred to above was reduced to $927 million.   The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. The CRC may and does adjust limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.  215                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2010, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  216      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Part II — OTHER INFORMATION        ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings    Included in Note 9(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       ITEM 1A. Risk Factors        Execution of Recapitalization    The execution of the Recapitalization is subject to various risks and uncertainties.   The Recapitalization Agreement in Principle entered into by AIG, the Department of the Treasury, the FRBNY and the Trust contemplates the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements relating to a number of transactions involving multiple parties. No assurance can be given that AIG, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury and the Trust will be able to agree on definitive documentation or that the transactions set forth in the definitive documentation will be substantially the same as those contemplated by the Recapitalization Agreement in Principle.   Even if definitive documentation is executed, numerous factors, many of which are outside of AIG's control, could impair its ability to implement or complete the Recapitalization. In particular, AIG's ability to effect the Recapitalization will be subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals, third-party approvals and satisfactory rating profiles from rating agencies. The Recapitalization could be adversely affected by, among other things:    •an inability to complete the asset disposition plan of AIG, including the sales of AIG's interests in AIG Star and AIG Edison;   •an inability to secure third-party financing commitments;   •declines in AIG asset values and deterioration in its businesses; and   •an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or third-party consents for the proposed transactions.    No assurance can be given that AIG will be able to meet the conditions to the completion of the Recapitalization or to otherwise successfully implement the Recapitalization.   The complexity of executing the Recapitalization, combined with the challenges of operating its businesses in the current environment, could place further stress on AIG's internal controls, increase its costs and divert the attention of its management and employees from their normal duties, all of which may adversely affect AIG's business, both in terms of operations and ability to focus on and retain customers.   If AIG is not able to complete the Recapitalization, it is unclear how AIG's businesses, operations and liquidity will be affected. A failure to complete the Recapitalization could result in, among other things, a reduced level of support from the U.S. government, ratings downgrades and a loss in confidence in AIG by customers. As a result, a failure to complete the Recapitalization could have a material adverse effect on AIG's businesses, operations and liquidity.   AIG and its subsidiaries are also parties to various contracts and other agreements that may be affected by a change of control of AIG.       ITEM 6. Exhibits
