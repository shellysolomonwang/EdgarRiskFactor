Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “generally accepted accounting principles” in the United States. The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Book value per common share excluding AOCI, is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Return on equity – Adjusted after-tax income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted return on equity. Adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity. The reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (APTI) adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG: • deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;  • changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and • net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this MD&A. Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our operating segments.   74 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Measures     Adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:    • changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits; • changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; • loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; • all net realized capital gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized capital gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);    • income or loss from discontinued operations; • net loss reserve discount benefit (charge); • pension expense related to a one-time lump sum payment to former employees; • income and loss from divested businesses;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization; and • the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain.    · General Insurance – Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. – Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural and man-made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. We believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results. · Life and Retirement – Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding agreements and mutual funds. Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 75       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Critical Accounting Estimates       Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:         • loss reserves; • reinsurance assets; • valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; • valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; • estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; • impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment; • liability for legal contingencies; • fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; and • income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and provisional estimates associated with the Tax Act.     These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.  For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2017 Annual Report.        76 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary      Executive Summary  Overview This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in our securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2017 Annual Report, in their entirety for a more detailed description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.  On July 18, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Validus Holdings, Ltd. (Validus), a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance, and asset management services, for approximately $5.5 billion in cash. This transaction strengthens our global General Insurance business by expanding our current product portfolio through additional distribution channels and advancing the tools available to enhance underwriting. The results of Validus following the date of the acquisition will be included in our General Insurance segment starting in the third quarter of 2018. North America will include the results of Validus Reinsurance, Ltd., AlphaCat Reinsurance Ltd., Western World Insurance Group, Inc. and Crop Risk Services, Inc. International will include the results of Talbot Holdings Ltd. In February 2018, we closed a series of affiliated reinsurance transactions impacting the Legacy Portfolio. These transactions were designed to consolidate most of our Legacy Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity, DSA Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (DSA Re), a Bermuda domiciled composite reinsurer, 100 percent owned by AIG. The transactions include the cession of approximately $31 billion of reserves from our Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $5 billion of reserves from our Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines relating to business written by multiple AIG legal entities. This represented over 75 percent of the insurance reserves in the Legacy Portfolio as of December 31, 2017. DSA Re has approximately $42 billion of total assets, managed by AIG Investments, and is AIG’s main run-off reinsurer with its own dedicated management team. On July 31, 2018, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC (Fortitude), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, and TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P. (TCG), an affiliate of The Carlyle Group L.P. We formed Fortitude to act as a holding company for DSA Re. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions in the purchase agreement, TCG will purchase a 19.9 percent ownership interest in Fortitude. As of the closing of the transaction, Fortitude will own 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of DSA Re and AIG will have an 80.1 percent ownership interest in Fortitude.

This decrease was partially offset by:  • lower policyholder benefits and losses incurred driven by pre-tax favorable prior year loss reserve development in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to pre-tax unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017; • net realized capital gains in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017; and • gains on sale of divested businesses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to losses on sale of divested businesses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017.

AIG’s Outlook – Industry and economic factors Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first six months of 2018, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, uncertainties in the annuity marketplace resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at re-evaluating the standard of care for sales of investment products and services, historically high levels of catastrophic events, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the UK’s pending withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time. Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment Interest rates continued to increase in the first six months of 2018 but remained low relative to historical levels. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities. Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.  Annuity Sales and Surrenders The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.   AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 83       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Reinvestment and Spread Management We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments. For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 70 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at June 30, 2018. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 70 percent and 69 percent at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at June 30, 2018.   84 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    The following table presents fixed annuity and universal life account values of our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Life Insurance operating segments by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates:        Current Crediting Rates     June 30, 2018           1-50 Basis   More than 50                 Contractual Minimum Guaranteed    At Contractual   Points Above   Basis Points                 Interest Rate   Minimum   Minimum   Above Minimum                 (in millions)   Guarantee   Guarantee   Guarantee       Total         Individual Retirement*                                         1%   $   3,875   $   4,885   $   12,559   $   21,319         > 1% - 2%       6,824       86       3,580       10,490         > 2% - 3%       13,153       298       99       13,550         > 3% - 4%       9,886       43       8       9,937         > 4% - 5%       622       -       4       626         > 5% - 5.5%       34       -       5       39         Total Individual Retirement   $   34,394   $   5,312   $   16,255   $   55,961         Group Retirement*                                         1%   $   1,470   $   3,296   $   2,160   $   6,926         > 1% - 2%       6,206       607       137       6,950         > 2% - 3%       15,375       -       -       15,375         > 3% - 4%       865       -       -       865         > 4% - 5%       7,115       -       -       7,115         > 5% - 5.5%       179       -       -       179         Total Group Retirement   $   31,210   $   3,903   $   2,297   $   37,410         Universal life insurance                                         1%   $   -   $   -   $   10   $   10         > 1% - 2%       120       95       224       439         > 2% - 3%       607       471       996       2,074         > 3% - 4%       1,673       218       141       2,032         > 4% - 5%       3,182       220       -       3,402         > 5% - 5.5%       304       -       -       304         Total universal life insurance   $   5,886   $   1,004   $   1,371   $   8,261         Total   $   71,490   $   10,219   $   19,923   $   101,632         Percentage of total       70   %   10   %   20   %   100   %    * Individual Retirement and Group Retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products. General Insurance The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. Sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection. In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance Run-Off Lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 85       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Standard of Care Developments Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services that are subject to restrictions imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements set forth in the final fiduciary duty rule issued by the Department of Labor (the DOL) in April 2016 (the DOL Fiduciary Rule). On March 15, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Fifth Circuit) ruled that the DOL exceeded its authority in promulgating the DOL Fiduciary Rule, specifically in its broadening the scope of “investment advice” fiduciary and in the terms of the best interest contract exemption. Following the Fifth Circuit’s decision, the DOL announced on March 16, 2018, that it was suspending enforcement of the DOL Fiduciary Rule pending further review. The Fifth Circuit subsequently denied, on May 22, 2018, a motion to reconsider the panel’s decision and a further motion for rehearing by the full Fifth Circuit. If the Fifth Circuit’s final judgment is not further appealed, the ruling has the effect of invalidating the DOL Fiduciary Rule in its entirety. In addition to recent developments surrounding the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), lawmakers and state insurance regulators are also engaged in re-evaluating what is an appropriate regulatory framework around a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services. On April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretations designed to address the standard of care issues and the transparency of retail investors’ relationships with investment advisors and broker-dealers. The comment period for these proposed rules expires on August 7, 2018. We are evaluating the scope and potential impact of the SEC’s proposals and are closely following other similar federal and state-level regulatory developments. While we cannot predict the long-term impact of these developments on our Retirement businesses, we believe our diverse annuity product offerings position Individual Retirement and Group Retirement to compete effectively in this evolving marketplace.  Impact of Currency Volatility Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability. General Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the Major Currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses:         Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         Rate for 1 USD   2018   2017       Change           2018   2017       Change         Currency:                                                 GBP   0.72   0.79       (9)   %       0.73   0.80       (9)   %     EUR   0.82   0.92       (11)   %       0.82   0.93       (12)   %     JPY   107.76   111.86       (4)   %       109.19   113.27       (4)   %    Unless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the General Insurance discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the Major Currencies included in the preceding table. Other Industry Developments On September 7, 2017, the UK Ministry of Justice announced a proposal to increase the Ogden rate from negative 0.75 percent to between zero and one percent. This proposal has to be passed by Parliament. We will continue to monitor the progress with this potential change.        86 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations      Consolidated Results of Operations  The following section provides a comparative discussion of our Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Partially offset by: • lower policyholder benefits and losses incurred driven by pre-tax favorable prior year loss reserve development in the three-month period ending June 30, 2018 compared to pre-tax unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017;  • net realized capital gains due to: – Life and Retirement guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, which reflected net realized capital gains in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to changes in movement in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment (NPA), which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program (see Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results);  – a gain on the sale of our investment in Castle Holdings’ aircraft assets in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018; and • gains on sale of divested businesses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to losses on sale of divested businesses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. The three-month period ended June 30, 2017 included losses on the agreements to sell Fuji Life to FWD Group and certain insurance operations and assets to Fairfax. yEAR-TO-DATE pre-tax income Comparison for 2018 and 2017 Pre-tax income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to: • lower investment returns on alternative investments, primarily driven by less robust private equity and hedge fund performance compared to the same period in 2017, a decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected as a result of credit spread widening and rising interest rates, and lower invested assets resulting from the funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO late in the first quarter of 2017; and • lower premiums due to the sale of Fuji Life in the second quarter of 2017. Partially offset by: • lower policyholder benefits and losses incurred driven by pre-tax favorable prior year loss reserve development in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to pre-tax unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 mainly resulting from the reduction in the Ogden discount rate during the first quarter of 2017;  •  net realized capital gains due to: – Life and Retirement guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, which reflected net realized capital gains in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to net realized capital losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to changes in movement in the NPA, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program (see Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results);  – a gain on the sale of our investment in Castle Holdings’ aircraft assets in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018; and • gains on sale of divested businesses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to losses on sale of divested businesses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. The six-month period ended June 30, 2017 included losses on the agreements to sell Fuji Life to FWD Group and certain insurance operations and assets to Fairfax.   AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 91       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations    U.S. Tax Reform Overview On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduced the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry. At December 31, 2017, we originally recorded a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the Tax Act of $6.7 billion, including a tax charge of $6.7 billion attributable to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of $38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, we have not recorded any material adjustments to these provisional amounts. We continue to refine our analysis and calculations, which could impact the provisional estimates previously recorded. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2018, we have not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act.  Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income.  The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. There are substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of BEAT and GILTI and formal guidance from the U.S. tax authority is still pending. Depending on the content of such guidance, changes to the interpretations and assumptions made by us, and/or actions we may take, it is possible that the impact from BEAT or GILTI could change amounts recorded, possibly materially. Consistent with accounting guidance, we treat BEAT as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes in a similar manner.  In our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we made certain assumptions related to the impact of the Tax Act on our future taxable income. Generally, the Tax Act provisions result in an increase in our taxable income and, thus, accelerate utilization of our tax attribute deferred tax asset. Accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that our reliance on provisional estimates would have a material impact on our determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Repatriation Assumptions As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, we still consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. Deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. Deemed Repatriation Tax & Impact on Liquidity  The Tax Act required companies to pay a one-time transition tax, net of tax credits related to applicable foreign taxes paid, on previously untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In the determination of the deemed repatriation tax, we reviewed estimated post-1986 E&P of the relevant foreign subsidiaries, and any related non-U.S. income tax paid on such earnings. We originally recorded a provisional estimated tax benefit of $38 million at December 31, 2017. This amount is not considered to be material to our liquidity and capital resources. As we continue to refine our E&P analysis, we will refine our calculations of the one-time transition tax, which could impact the provisional estimate previously recorded.   92 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations    Interim Tax Calculation Method We use the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing our interim tax provision. Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit is reported in the same period as the related item. Certain tax effects are also not reflected in the estimated annual effective tax rate, primarily certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the period in which the change occurs. While certain impacts of the Tax Act are included in our annual effective tax rate, we continue to refine our calculations as additional information becomes available, which may result in changes to the estimated annual effective tax rate. Income Tax expense analysis For the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 25.6 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to tax charges related to income in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates higher than 21 percent, additional U.S. taxes imposed on income of our foreign subsidiaries under international provisions of the Tax Act, valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries and state jurisdictions and non-deductible transfer pricing charges, partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities.  For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 24.1 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to tax charges related to income in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates higher than 21 percent, additional U.S. taxes imposed on income of our foreign subsidiaries under international provisions of the Tax Act, valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries and state jurisdictions and non-deductible transfer pricing charges, partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2017, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 33.4 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt income and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, partially offset by tax charges related to increases in uncertain tax positions associated with the impact of settlement discussions with the IRS related to certain open tax issues.  For the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 31.6 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement, partially offset by tax charges related to increases in uncertain tax positions associated with the impact of settlement discussions with the IRS related to certain open tax issues.

AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 95       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     COMPETITION and challenges  Operating in a highly competitive industry,  General Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty  insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign  insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service. We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis — from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise. Our challenges include:  • long-tail Commercial Lines exposures that create added complexity in pricing and risk management; • over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;  • tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and • volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:  General Insurance – North America  Commercial Lines continues to face challenging market conditions, with excess capacity negatively impacting the rate environment and suppressing margins. However, we continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and sub-segments as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. We observe higher loss cost trends in Casualty, in particular Excess Casualty. The more profitable segments of Commercial Lines remain highly competitive; however, we continue to achieve growth in several of our high margin businesses. Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.   General Insurance – International  We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increases due to the growing number of international customers, while giving us the ability to respond quickly to local market conditions and build client relationships. The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, with increased pressure on rates, particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, due to increased market capacity and ample availability of capital. Despite this, we are continuing to grow our most profitable segments across all regions and are maintaining market leadership in key developed and developing markets. We are maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability. Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines. We expect our newly formed entity in Japan – AIG Sonpo – to provide the necessary scale and platform to compete more efficiently in the Japanese market. Outside of Japan, Personal Insurance continues to invest selectively in international markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability and lower volatility across the entire portfolio.   96 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     General INSURANCE RESULTS         Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,     (in millions)       2018       2017       Change               2018       2017       Change         Underwriting results:                                                                 Net premiums written   $   6,977   $   6,672       5   %       $   13,148   $   12,969       1   %     (Increase) decrease in unearned premiums(a)       (407)       (148)       (175)               105       44       139         Net premiums earned       6,570       6,524       1               13,253       13,013       2         Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred(b)       4,317       4,175       3               8,805       8,412       5         Acquisition expenses:                                                                 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       1,092       960       14               2,158       1,869       15         Other acquisition expenses       297       350       (15)               682       738       (8)         Total acquisition expenses       1,389       1,310       6               2,840       2,607       9         General operating expenses       953       890       7               1,948       1,833       6         Underwriting income (loss)(a)       (89)       149       NM               (340)       161       NM         Net investment income       657       897       (27)               1,418       1,946       (27)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   568   $   1,046       (46)   %       $   1,078   $   2,107       (49)   %       Loss ratio(b)       65.7       64.0       1.7               66.4       64.6       1.8         Acquisition ratio       21.1       20.1       1.0               21.4       20.0       1.4         General operating expense ratio        14.5       13.6       0.9               14.7       14.1       0.6         Expense ratio       35.6       33.7       1.9               36.1       34.1       2.0         Combined ratio(b)       101.3       97.7       3.6               102.5       98.7       3.8         Adjustments for accident year loss ratio, as adjusted                                                                 and accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:                                                                 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums       (2.3)       (2.8)       0.5               (3.9)       (3.1)       (0.8)         Prior year development, net of (additional) return premium on loss sensitive business       0.8       (1.1)       1.9               1.2       (0.8)       2.0         Adjustment for ceded premiums under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years and other       1.2       (0.4)       1.6               0.5       (0.3)       0.8         Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted       65.4       59.7       5.7               64.2       60.4       3.8         Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted       101.0       93.4       7.6               100.3       94.5       5.8        (a) In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, the Underwriting loss included an additional $115 million of net premiums earned for multi-year policies related to earlier accident years.

AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 99       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     Business and Financial Highlights The North America General Insurance business is focused on making progress towards improved underwriting results and efficiencies. This includes strengthening our talent base; ongoing investment in pricing and monitoring tools; continuous review of our risk appetite combined with enhanced focus on portfolio management and individual business strategy; and increased use of reinsurance.  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income reflecting lower investment returns on alternative investments, decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected and lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from the first quarter 2017 funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO.  In the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, the loss ratio decreased primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year loss reserve development partially offset by higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year, the loss ratio increased primarily due to the higher catastrophe losses and higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. The increase in the current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was mainly driven by higher severe losses, an increase in Excess casualty and Financial Lines loss estimates which occurred in the second half of 2017, and higher ceded earned premiums related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program, which were partially offset by a favorable change in the portfolio mix.  Net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower ceded premiums driven by changes in the 2018 reinsurance programs and portfolio mix. Net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to lower production primarily in Property and remediation in programs business partially offset by growth in the Travel business within Personal Insurance.    North America Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended June 30, (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to:  • lower investment returns on alternative investments, primarily driven by less robust private equity and hedge fund performance compared to the same period in 2017, and a decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected, as a result of credit spread widening and rising interest rates; • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to higher severe losses, higher ceded premiums related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program, and an increase in Excess casualty and Financial Lines loss estimates which occurred in the second half of 2017, partially offset by a favorable change in the portfolio mix; • higher acquisition expenses primarily driven by changes in Personal Insurance’s portfolio mix and higher insurance taxes, licenses and fees; and • higher general operating expenses primarily driven by targeted investment in strategic program initiatives. This decrease was partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year loss reserve development.          100 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        North America Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to:  • lower investment returns on alternative investments, primarily driven by less robust private equity and hedge fund performance compared to the same period in 2017, and a decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected, as a result of credit spread widening and rising interest rates, as well as lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from the first quarter 2017 funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO; • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to higher severe losses, higher ceded premiums related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program, and an increase in Excess casualty and Financial Lines loss estimates which occurred in the second half of 2017, partially offset by a favorable change in the portfolio mix; • higher acquisition expenses primarily driven by changes in Personal Insurance’s portfolio mix and higher insurance taxes, licenses and fees; and • higher catastrophe losses. This decrease was partially offset by higher favorable prior year loss reserve development compared to unfavorable loss reserve development in the prior-year period.         North America Net Premiums Written Three Months Ended June 30, (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison Net premiums written increased primarily due to: • growth in the Travel business within Personal Insurance; and  • lower ceded premiums due to changes in the 2018 reinsurance programs. This increase was partially offset by lower production primarily in Property and remediation in programs business mainly due to underwriting actions taken to strengthen our portfolio and to maintain pricing discipline.        AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 101       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        North America Net Premiums Written Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison Net premiums written decreased primarily due to lower production primarily in Property, D&O products within Financial Lines and remediation in programs business mainly due to underwriting actions taken to strengthen our portfolio and to maintain pricing discipline.  This decrease was partially offset by growth in the Travel business within Personal Insurance.         North America Combined Ratios Three Months Ended June 30,        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison  The increase in the combined ratio reflected an increase in the expense ratio partially offset by a decrease in the loss ratio. The increase in the expense ratio reflected:  • a higher acquisition ratio driven primarily by changes in Personal Insurance’s portfolio mix and higher insurance taxes, licenses and fees; and • a higher general operating expense ratio primarily driven by targeted investment in strategic program initiatives. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected lower catastrophe losses and favorable prior year loss reserve development. This decrease was partially offset by higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to: • higher severe losses; • higher ceded earned premiums related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program; and  • an increase in Excess casualty and Financial Lines loss estimates which occurred in the second half of 2017.          102 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        North America Combined Ratios Six Months Ended June 30,        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison  The increase in the combined ratio reflected an increase in both the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, partially offset by higher favorable prior year loss reserve development. The increase in the current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was primarily due to: • higher severe losses; • higher ceded earned premiums related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program; and  • an increase in Excess casualty and Financial Lines loss estimates in the second half of 2017, which was partially offset by a favorable change in the portfolio mix.

Business and Financial Highlights The International General Insurance business is focused on delivering an underwriting profit and improved efficiency, further improving underwriting margins, and growing profitably in segments and geographies that support our growth strategy. This includes the execution of efficiency gains and a return to a focus on new business sales in Japan, preparation for Brexit, and a strategic review of the use of reinsurance.  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher severe, attritional and catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior year loss reserve development.  Net premiums written, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to higher premiums in the Accident & Health business and the inclusion of the seasonally large Fuji annual policy renewal period, which in previous years was reported in the third quarter, partially offset by the sale of certain insurance operations and assets to Fairfax. Net premiums written, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 also reflected the Japan Merger Impact and higher ceded premiums related to the changes in 2018 reinsurance programs resulting in a decrease compared to the same period in the prior year.     104 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        International Adjusted Pre-Tax Income  Three Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison Adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to higher severe, attritional and catastrophe losses. This decrease was partially offset by favorable prior year loss reserve development in the second quarter of 2018 compared to unfavorable development in the prior year period.           International Adjusted Pre-Tax Income  Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison Adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to: • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven primarily by higher severe and attritional losses, and higher ceded earned premiums related to the additional reinsurance protection against severe losses added for international locations on a global basis and the 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program; • lower investment returns on alternative investments, primarily driven by less robust private equity and hedge fund performance compared to the same period in 2017, and a decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected, as a result of credit spread widening and rising interest rates; and • higher catastrophe losses. This decrease was partially offset by favorable prior year loss reserve development in the first half of 2018 compared to unfavorable development in the prior year mainly resulting from the reduction in the Ogden discount rate.        AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 105       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        International Net Premiums Written Three Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison Net premiums written, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased due to: • higher premiums driven by Accident & Health business;  • growth in the Financial Lines business in Europe; and  • higher premiums in Japan driven in part by the annual policy renewal period being reported in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of the prior year as a result of conforming Fuji’s fiscal reporting period following its merger into AIG Sonpo. These increases were partially offset by:  • the sale of certain insurance operations and assets to Fairfax; and • lower new business production in Japan resulting from a focus on servicing existing renewals, remediation of certain distribution channels and reduction in the direct-to-policyholder business, for which new business was discontinued in 2016.     International Net Premiums Written Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison Net premiums written, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased due to: • the sale of certain insurance operations and assets to Fairfax; • higher ceded premiums due to changes in 2018 reinsurance programs; • lower new business production in Japan resulting from a focus on servicing existing renewals, remediation of certain distribution channels and reduction in the direct-to-policyholder business, for which new business was discontinued in 2016; and • lower production in Property and Casualty primarily driven by execution of our portfolio optimization strategy in Europe. This decrease was partially offset by:  • higher premiums driven by the Accident & Health business; • growth of the Financial Lines business in Europe; and • the Japan Merger Impact.        106 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        International Combined Ratios Three Months Ended June 30,         Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison The increase in combined ratio primarily reflected a higher loss ratio while the expense ratio remained relatively flat. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to:  • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven by higher severe and attritional losses; and • higher catastrophe losses.  This increase in the loss ratio was partially offset by favorable prior year loss reserve development in the second quarter of 2018 compared to unfavorable development in the prior year period.        International Combined Ratios Six Months Ended June 30,         Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison The increase in combined ratio primarily reflected a higher loss ratio while the expense ratio remained relatively flat. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to:  • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven by higher severe and attritional losses, and higher ceded earned premiums; and • higher catastrophe losses.  This increase in the loss ratio was partially offset by favorable prior year loss reserve development in the first half of 2018 compared to unfavorable development in the prior year period mainly resulting from the reduction in the Ogden discount rate.

AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 109       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     COMPETITION and challenges  Life and Retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the U.S. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including banks and  other  life insurance and mutual fund companies. Competition  is  primarily  based  on  product  pricing  and  design,  distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business. Our business remains competitive due to its  long-standing  market leading  positions,  innovative  products,  distribution  relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings. Our primary challenges include:  · a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields; · increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and peers with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space; · increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have affected industry growth; and · upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:  Individual Retirement  Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in  this product space. In  response  to  the  continued  low interest  rate environment, which  has  added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive  to  the  level of interest rates.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.   Group Retirement  Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the VALIC  brand. VALIC  is a leading retirement  plan provider in the  U.S. for  K-12  schools  and school  districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for  both plan  sponsors and individual participants.  To  meet  this  challenge,  VALIC  is investing  in a  client-focused  technology  platform  to support  improved compliance  and self-service functionality. VALIC’s  service model  pairs self-service  tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.    110 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Life Insurance  Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, as well as to supplement retirement income.  In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio has been evolving. We will continue to place a strong focus on indexed universal life products and de-emphasize products with long-duration interest rate guarantees.  As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the United States, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.   Institutional Markets  Institutional Markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. Demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. We expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities.

While interest rates continue to increase, rates remain low relative to historical levels. Premiums and deposits improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Premiums and deposits in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 included deposits from the FHLB funding agreement. Net flows in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 deteriorated compared to the same periods in the prior year and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders and withdrawals, primarily in Retail Mutual Funds.  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting higher policyholder benefits, and decreases in equity market performance, Fixed Annuity base net investment spread and gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher policy fees and advisory fees, increased base portfolio income for Index Annuities and, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, the receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities. Fixed Annuities base net investment spread in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, excluding accretion and other investment income, declined compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower reinvestment yields.   112 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement        Individual Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to: • higher policyholder benefits, which reflected unfavorable actuarial adjustments to Variable Annuities in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to favorable adjustments to immediate annuities in the prior year period; • a decline in net investment income, primarily due to lower gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected; • a decline in Fixed Annuity base net investment spread driven by lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by increases from accretion and other investment income. In addition, income from base portfolio reflected declines due to lower invested assets in Fixed Annuities; and • lower equity market performance in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, which contributed to an increase in DAC amortization. Partially offsetting these decreases were:  • higher Index Annuity base portfolio income reflecting growth in assets; and • higher policy fees and advisory fees, net of expenses, primarily driven by asset growth in Index and Variable Annuities.         Individual Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to: • higher policyholder benefits, which reflected unfavorable actuarial adjustments to Variable Annuities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to favorable adjustments to immediate annuities in the prior year period; • a decline in net investment income, primarily from lower gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and income from bond call and tender, partially offset by the receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities; • lower equity market performance in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, which contributed to increases in policyholder benefits and DAC amortization; and • a decline in Fixed Annuity base net investment spread driven by lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by increases from accretion and other investment income. In addition, income from base portfolio reflected declines due to lower invested assets in Fixed Annuities. Partially offsetting these decreases were:  • higher Index Annuity base portfolio income reflecting growth in assets; and • higher policy fees and advisory fees, net of expenses, primarily driven by asset growth in Index and Variable Annuities.      AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 113       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Individual Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Individual Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to competitive market rates.  Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, FHLB funding agreements and mutual funds under administration.  Net flows for annuity products in Individual Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. Deposits from FHLB funding agreements were excluded from net flows of Individual Retirement, as net flows from these funding agreements are not considered part of the metric to measure Individual Retirement’s core recurring performance.

For Variable and Index Annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charges at June 30, 2018 has decreased compared to December 31, 2017 due to normal aging of the business and continued decline in sales. The increase in reserves with no surrender charge contributed to the increase in the surrender rate for Variable and Index Annuities in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Increases in market interest rates in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 contributed to the increase in the surrender rate for Fixed Annuities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.   114 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows:    Individual Retirement Premiums and Deposits (P&D) and Net Flows Three Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison  • Fixed Annuities premiums and deposits increased primarily due to higher broker dealer and bank distribution sales driven by favorable market conditions.

Index annuity net flows increased primarily due to higher sales. Variable annuity net flows remained negative and deteriorated primarily due to lower sales and higher surrenders.  • Retail Mutual Funds net flows remained negative and deteriorated reflecting lower deposits and higher withdrawals due to continued negative industry trends in U.S. equity actively managed funds and the impact of underperformance within our largest fund in early 2018.

However, external factors, including the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in target markets, continue to impact Group Retirement’s customer retention. Premiums and deposits increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Premiums and deposits in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 included deposits from the FHLB funding agreement. Net flows deteriorated in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders, partially offset by increased deposits.  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 as improvements in base net investment spread and higher policy fees were more than offset by higher general operating expenses. Adjusted pre-tax income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 reflecting improved base net investment spread, higher policy fees and the receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities, partially offset by higher general operating expenses and decreases in gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and income from bond call and tender.  Group Retirement base net investment spread improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to effective crediting rate management, higher accretion and other investment income, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields. Excluding accretion and other investment income, base spreads were in line with the prior year periods.   116 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement        Group Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to:  • higher general operating expenses, which reflected lower legal expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 and continued investments in people and technology in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018; and • an increase in policyholder benefits primarily due an increase in reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefits. Partially offsetting these decreases were: • an increase in net investment spread primarily due to effective crediting rate management, higher accretion and other investment income, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields; and • higher policy fees primarily driven by growth in separate account assets.         Group Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Six Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income increased primarily due to: • higher net investment income, primarily from the receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities, partially offset by lower gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and income from bond call and tender activity;  • an increase in net investment spread primarily due to effective crediting rate management, higher accretion and other investment income, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields; and • higher policy fees primarily driven by growth in assets.

AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 117       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Group Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Group Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, which primarily represent immediate annuities, increased compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting the typical volumes expected for this product. Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, FHLB funding agreements and mutual funds under administration.  Net flows for annuity products included in Group Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. Deposits from FHLB funding agreements were excluded from net flows of Group Retirement, as net flows from these funding agreements are not considered part of the metric to measure Group Retirement’s core recurring performance.

Group Retirement annuities are typically subject to a five- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. At June 30, 2018, Group Retirement annuity reserves increased compared to December 31, 2017 primarily due to increased deposits. The surrender rate in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher surrenders, including approximately $870 million of large group plan surrenders.   118 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows follows:    Group Retirement Premiums and Deposits and Net Flows Three Months Ended June 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2018 and 2017 Comparison  Net flows deteriorated and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders driven mainly by the consolidation of healthcare providers, partially offset by higher group acquisition deposits.

Life Insurance GAAP Premiums and Premiums and Deposits Premiums for Life Insurance represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, primarily term life, international life and health and group benefits. Premiums, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in international life and health, including assumed premiums on business distributed by Laya Healthcare, and an increase in domestic term life premiums, partially offset by lower premiums on group benefits policies. Premiums, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased slightly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year as lower group benefits premiums more than offset the growth in international life and health and domestic term life businesses.

Effective February 2018, our Bermuda domiciled composite reinsurer, DSA Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (DSA Re) is included in our Legacy Portfolio. · Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines - Reserves consist of certain structured settlements, pension risk transfer annuities and single premium immediate annuities written prior to April 2012. Also includes exposures to whole life, long-term care and exited accident & health product lines. · Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines - Reserves consist of excess workers’ compensation, environmental exposures and exposures to other products within General Insurance that are no longer actively marketed. Also includes the remaining reserves in Eaglestone Reinsurance Company (Eaglestone).  · Legacy Investments – Includes investment classes that we have placed into run-off including holdings in direct investments as well as investments in global capital markets and global real estate.  BUSINESS STRATEGY   For Legacy insurance lines, securing the interests of our policyholders and insureds is paramount. We have considered and continue to evaluate the following strategies for these lines: • Third party and affiliated reinsurance and retrocessions to improve capital efficiency • Commutations of assumed reinsurance and direct policy buy-backs • Enhance insured policyholder options and claims resolution strategies • Enhanced asset liability management and expense management For Legacy investments, our business strategy is to maximize liquidity to AIG Parent and minimize book value impairments while sourcing for our insurance companies attractive assets for their portfolios. SALE OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN DSA RE DSA Re was formed during the first quarter of 2018 in connection with a series of affiliated reinsurance transactions related to our Legacy Portfolio. Those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our Legacy Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity. As of June 30, 2018, the affiliated transactions included the cession of approximately $31 billion of reserves from our Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $5 billion of reserves from our Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2018, we formed Fortitude, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, to act as a holding company for DSA Re. On July 31, 2018, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Fortitude and TCG, an affiliate of The Carlyle Group L.P. (Carlyle). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, the Purchase Agreement provides that TCG will purchase a 19.9 percent ownership interest in Fortitude (the DSA Re Transaction). Following the closing of the DSA Re Transaction (the DSA Re Closing), Fortitude will own 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of DSA Re and AIG will have an 80.1 percent ownership interest in Fortitude. Subject to certain adjustments specified in the Purchase Agreement, TCG will pay us approximately $476 million, which is based on DSA Re’s total shareholder’s equity of $2.9 billion as of March 31, 2018 excluding planned distributions that the parties will seek to cause to be paid to us on a non-pro rata basis prior to the end of the 18th month following the DSA Re Closing, subject to regulatory approvals (the Target Distribution). $381 million of the purchase price will be paid at the DSA Re Closing and up to $95 million will be paid following December 31, 2023 (the Deferred Payment), subject to the purchase price adjustment described below. To the extent we do not receive all or a portion of the Target Distribution within 18 months of the DSA Re Closing, TCG will pay us up to an additional $100 million.    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 127       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Legacy Portfolio    As part of the establishment of DSA Re, we implemented a capital maintenance agreement (CMA) with DSA Re that remains in effect so long as we own at least 50 percent of DSA Re. If there are any CMA funding obligations that occur within 18 months of the DSA Re Closing, we will fund those obligations on a non-dilutive basis to TCG, but only if, and to the extent, we actually receive the Target Distribution prior to the expiration of such period.  The affiliated reinsurance transactions executed in the first quarter of 2018 with DSA Re resulted in prepaid insurance assets on the ceding subsidiaries’ balance sheets of approximately $2.5 billion (after-tax). These assets have been eliminated in AIG’s consolidated financial statements since the counterparties were wholly-owned. In the event of a sale of a controlling interest in Fortitude, our Legacy Portfolio may recognize a loss for the portion of the unamortized balance of these assets and related deferred acquisition costs of $0.5 billion (after-tax) that are not recoverable, if any, in the period in which our interest in Fortitude becomes non-controlling. This loss would be incremental to any gain or loss recognized on the sale of our controlling interest in Fortitude. We have also agreed to a post-closing purchase price adjustment wherein we will reimburse TCG for adverse development in property casualty related reserves, based on an agreed methodology, that occurs on or prior to December 31, 2023, up to the value of TCG’s investment in Fortitude. Any amount due to TCG in respect of this will be offset by the amount of the Deferred Payment otherwise due from TCG to us. We have agreed to commit to invest $6 billion of investment assets into various Carlyle strategies within the 30 months following the DSA Re Closing, and will be required to pay a proportionate amount of an agreed make-whole fee to the extent we fail to satisfy such commitment. Our Board of Directors and the governing bodies of TCG and Fortitude have each approved the DSA Re Transaction. Each of the parties has made customary representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement and agreed to certain covenants and agreements. We have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to cause DSA Re to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice between the date of the Purchase Agreement and the DSA Re Closing and that DSA Re will not engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period.  As contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, at the DSA Re Closing, we, Fortitude and TCG will enter into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Fortitude, governing the rights of the parties thereto. In addition, at the DSA Re Closing, DSA Re will enter into (1) a Transition Services Agreement with us, pursuant to which we and certain of our affiliates will provide certain transition services to DSA Re, (2) an Investment Management Agreement with an affiliate of TCG (the Investment Manager), pursuant to which the Investment Manager will provide certain alternative asset management and advisory services to DSA Re with respect to certain asset classes and (3) an Exclusivity Agreement with the Investment Manager pursuant to which the Investment Manager will be the exclusive provider of alternative asset management and advisory services with respect to certain new business acquired by DSA Re following the DSA Re Closing with respect to certain asset classes.  Consummation of the DSA Re Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, (1) the receipt of regulatory approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, (2) the absence of any injunction, judgment or ruling of a governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the DSA Re Transaction and (3) subject to specified materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of, and performance of all covenants by, the parties as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, our obligations and the obligations of Fortitude to consummate the DSA Re Transaction are conditioned on DSA Re’s receipt of approvals from its board of directors regarding entry into the Investment Management Agreement and the Exclusivity Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also provides for certain termination rights for both us and TCG.     128 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Legacy Portfolio    LEGACY PORTFOLIO RESULTS         Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2018       2017       Change               2018       2017       Change         Revenues:                                                                 Premiums   $   134   $   146       (8)   %       $   275   $   313       (12)   %     Policy fees       32       32       -               62       67       (7)         Net investment income       623       722       (14)               1,188       1,452       (18)         Other income (loss)       (8)       238       NM               92       390       (76)         Total adjusted revenues       781       1,138       (31)               1,617       2,222       (27)         Benefits and expenses:                                                                 Policyholder benefits and losses and loss adjustment                                                                 expenses incurred       453       488       (7)               959       970       (1)         Interest credited to policyholder account balances       63       57       11               122       120       2         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       19       14       36               37       42       (12)         General operating and other expenses       104       120       (13)               204       247       (17)         Interest expense       8       28       (71)               16       70       (77)         Total benefits and expenses       647       707       (8)               1,338       1,449       (8)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   134   $   431       (69)   %       $   279   $   773       (64)   %     Adjusted pre-tax income by type:                                                                 General Insurance Run-Off Lines   $   44   $   57       (23)   %       $   106   $   144       (26)   %     Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines       58       139       (58)               86       229       (62)         Legacy Investments       32       235       (86)               87       400       (78)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   134   $   431       (69)   %       $   279   $   773       (64)   %    Business and Financial Highlights In February 2018, we used $2.6 billion of existing Legacy Portfolio cash and investment assets to capitalize DSA Re in order to enable it to assume insurance risk and other economic risk from U.S. and Bermudian insurance companies. These assets included approximately $1.6 billion of capital released by Eaglestone, an affiliated entity, to AIG Parent as a result of the commutation of certain property and casualty risks from other AIG subsidiaries, which were subsequently ceded to DSA Re. DSA Re also has additional eligible regulatory capital under the Bermuda Monetary Authority capital framework in the form of $550 million in letter of credit agreements with guarantees from AIG Parent. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, DSA Re disbursed tax sharing payments of $369 million to AIG Parent.

Legacy Portfolio Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2018 and 2017 Comparison Adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to:  • lower Legacy Life and Retirement earnings compared to the first half of 2017 due to lower net investment income and a refinement in reserves related to pay-out annuities, which was partially offset by modest mortality gains; • lower Legacy General Insurance earnings compared to the first half of 2017 due to lower net investment income; and  • lower Legacy Investment earnings compared to the first half of 2017 due to continued dispositions of non- insurance investment assets, primarily driven by the sale of the life settlements portfolio in 2017 and lower gain on fair value option portfolios in the first half of 2018.        130 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments      Investments  Overview Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective operating segments and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.    Investment Highlights in the Six Months Ended June 30, 2018     • A rise in interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as the adoption of the Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Standard (Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Standard) on January 1, 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of unrealized gains in our equity securities to retained earnings, resulted in a net unrealized loss in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2018 from approximately $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2017. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • Lower investment returns on alternative investments, primarily driven by less robust private equity and hedge fund performance compared to the same period in 2017, a decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected as a result of credit spread widening and rising interest rates, and lower invested assets resulting from the funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO late in the first quarter 2017. • During the six-months ended June 30, 2018, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately $1.3 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  • In the first quarter of 2018, we sold our remaining interest in Arch Capital, which we received as part of the consideration for selling United Guaranty to Arch in 2016.    Investment Strategies  Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in General Insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by General Insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  • While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life and Retirement companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.  • AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. Attribution of Net Investment Income to Operating Segments Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.   AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 131       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    For General Insurance — North America and International and Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the General Insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment For Life and Retirement — Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life and Retirement companies. All invested assets of the Life and Retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment. Asset Liability Measurement For the General Insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The General Insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the General Insurance companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, the General Insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.1 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.5 years. The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life and Retirement companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.  The Life and Retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies, we have reduced the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.2 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency    132 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the Life and Retirement companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 21.7 years. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade.  The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.   For a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings see Investments – Credit Ratings.

Credit Ratings At June 30, 2018, approximately 89 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2018, approximately 22 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 8 percent    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 34 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Composite AIG Credit Ratings With respect to our fixed maturity securities, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity securities), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.

(b) Impairments in 2017 include $35 million related to other assets that were sold. Other-Than-Temporary Impairments To determine other-than-temporary impairments, we use fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized. The following tables present other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in earnings on fixed maturity securities, equity securities, private equity funds and hedge funds.

Upon the adoption of the Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Standard on January 1, 2018, equity securities are no longer required to be evaluated for other-than-temporary impairments.   140 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the six-months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $121 million and $188 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $269 million and $376 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For a discussion of our other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report.  The following table shows the aging of the pre-tax unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities, the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost or cost, and the number of respective items in each category:    June 30, 2018   Less Than or Equal           Greater Than 20%           Greater Than 50%                         to 20% of Cost(b)           to 50% of Cost(b)           of Cost(b)           Total      Aging(a)           Unrealized                   Unrealized                   Unrealized                   Unrealized         (dollars in millions)       Cost(c)       Loss   Items(e)           Cost(c)        Loss   Items(e)           Cost(c)        Loss   Items(e)            Cost(c)        Loss(d)    Items(e)      Investment grade                                                                                                 bonds                                                                                                 0-6 months   $   60,327   $   1,653   7,430       $   76   $   18   3       $   10   $   8   4       $   60,413   $   1,679   7,437     7-11 months       17,798       777   2,082           -       -   -           -       -   -           17,798       777   2,082     12 months or more       12,726       813   1,544           27       9   13           29       18   11           12,782       840   1,568     Total   $   90,851   $   3,243   11,056       $   103   $   27   16       $   39   $   26   15       $   90,993   $   3,296   11,087     Below investment                                                                                                 grade bonds                                                                                                 0-6 months   $   6,277   $   194   3,013       $   104   $   29   39       $   172   $   170   15       $   6,553   $   393   3,067     7-11 months       1,015       59   436           378       131   8           -       -   1           1,393       190   445     12 months or more       1,702       125   359           122       34   25           25       15   9           1,849       174   393     Total   $   8,994   $   378   3,808       $   604   $   194   72       $   197   $   185   25       $   9,795   $   757   3,905     Total bonds                                                                                                 0-6 months   $   66,604   $   1,847   10,443       $   180   $   47   42       $   182   $   178   19       $   66,966   $   2,072   10,504     7-11 months       18,813       836   2,518           378       131   8           -       -   1           19,191       967   2,527     12 months or more       14,428       938   1,903           149       43   38           54       33   20           14,631       1,014   1,961     Total(e)   $   99,845   $   3,621   14,864       $   707   $   221   88       $   236   $   211   40       $   100,788   $   4,053   14,992    (a) Represents the number of consecutive months that fair value has been less than cost by any amount.

AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 141       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, net unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities decreased by $8.0 billion due primarily to an increase in rates and a widening of credit spreads.  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $3.3 billion due primarily to a decrease in rates and a narrowing of credit spreads. For further discussion of our investment portfolio see also Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net realized capital gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 were primarily related to derivative gains, which more than offset other-than-temporary impairment charges and foreign exchange losses. Net realized capital losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 were primarily related to derivative and hedge accounting losses, and impairments, which were higher than the foreign exchange gains and the gains recognized on the sales of securities.  Variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to losses in the same periods in the prior year primarily due to changes in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the valuation of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) embedded derivative, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program.

Consistent with our definition of APTI, prior year development excludes the portion of (favorable)/ unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under the NICO reinsurance agreements of $(19) million and $273 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $(10) million and $284 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The related changes in amortization of the deferred gain were $13 million and $20 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $(10) million and $17 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net Loss Development In the three- and six month periods ended June 30, 2018 we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of $63 million and $173 million, respectively. For North America, the favorable development in the current period was primarily driven by amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO and favorable development on prior year catastrophes in U.S. Property and Special Risks business. This was partially offset by adverse development in U.S. Personal Insurance. For International, the favorable development was driven by Europe and Japan Personal Insurance, partially offset by Non-European Financial Lines. For the Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we recognized $150 million of adverse development in pre-1986 environmental liability entirely offset by favorable development in casualty policies relating to the trucking business, with smaller favorable contributions from runoff medical malpractice and post-1986 environmental liability. The adverse development in pre-1986 environmental liability was driven by increasing severity of claims from excess casualty policies. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $56 million and $66 million, respectively. This unfavorable development was primarily a result of the following:  • Higher than expected losses for U.S. Other Casualty – we observed unfavorable claim experience within primary general liability segments, particularly due to construction defects and multi-year construction projects that cover all contractors on the site (wrap business), along with other large individual claims with nearly all of the unfavorable development coming from accident years 2015 and prior and roughly one-third from accident years 2006 and prior. • Unfavorable development in U.S. Excess Casualty was driven by continued unfavorable claim experience in the construction defects and wrap business primarily from accident years 2006 and prior. • Higher than expected losses in Europe Property and Special Risks were driven by unexpected development on several large claims including aviation, marine and trade credit primarily from accident year 2016. In addition in the first quarter of 2017, we increased our loss reserves by $102 million as a result of the decision made by the UK Ministry of Justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump-sum bodily injury payouts, known as the Ogden rate. This change primarily impacted the Europe Casualty and Financial Lines. These prior year loss reserve increases were partially offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO in North America.   144 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The following tables summarize incurred (favorable) unfavorable prior year development net of reinsurance, by segment and major lines of business, and by accident year groupings:    Three Months Ended June 30, 2018                             (in millions)       Total       2017       2016 & Prior     General Insurance North America:                             U.S. Workers' Compensation   $   (25)   $   -

These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above. This may affect the comparability of the data presented in our tables.  Significant Reinsurance Agreements In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement.   146 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     For a description of AIG’s catastrophe reinsurance protection for 2018, see Part II, Item 7.

The lines of business subject to this agreement have been the source of the majority of the prior year adverse development charges over the past several years. The agreement is expected to result in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. In addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets. For a summary of significant reinsurers see Item 7.

AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 147       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     LIFE AND ANNUITY reserves and dac The following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs. Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. The liabilities for GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors. In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.  For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Life and Retirement Companies Key Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs in our 2017 Annual Report.  Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following: • The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero; • The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and • The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include: • Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative; • Realized volatility versus implied volatility;  • Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and • Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.   148 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:                                June 30,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2018       2017     Reconciliation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target:                                         Embedded derivative liability                       $   1,332   $   1,994     Exclude non-performance risk adjustment                           (1,876)       (1,947)     Embedded derivative liability, excluding NPA                           3,208       3,941     Adjustments for risk margins and differences in valuation                           (1,458)       (1,557)     Economic hedge target liability                       $   1,750   $   2,384    Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss) The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits. The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:            Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended             June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2018       2017           2018       2017     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA   $   373   $   (19)       $   924   $   572     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio:                                         Fixed maturity securities       (37)       80           (114)       91     Interest rate derivative contracts       (184)       213           (590)       30     Equity derivative contracts       (154)       (259)           (80)       (668)     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio       (375)       34           (784)       (547)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives excluding NPA, net of hedging portfolio        (2)       15           140       25     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to NPA spread       100       (218)           172       (403)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to change in NPA volume       (99)       79           (243)       (124)     Total change due to NPA       1       (139)           (71)       (527)     Net impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   (1)   $   (124)       $   69   $   (502)                                               By Consolidated Income Statement line                                         Net Investment Income   $   (37)   $   80       $   (114)   $   91     Net Realized capital gains (losses)       36       (204)           183       (593)     Net Impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   (1)   $   (124)       $   69   $   (502)    The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 (excluding related DAC amortization) was insignificant as gains from the impact of widening credit spreads on the NPA were substantially offset by the impact on NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher interest rates. The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by gains from the impact of widening credit spreads on the NPA spread, higher interest rates and equity market volatility, partially offset by the impact on NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher interest rates. The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily driven by losses from the impact of tightening    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 149       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     credit spreads on the NPA spread in both periods, and the impact on the NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, driven by higher equity markets. The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 reflected gains from equity market volatility and reductions in risk margins due to higher interest rates, substantially offset by losses from the related hedging portfolio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, fair value gains on embedded derivatives, excluding NPA, was not fully offset by fair value losses on the related hedging portfolio. The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding NPA in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio.  Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis, due to the NPA and other risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below. Change in Economic Hedge Target The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in the first half of 2018 was primarily due to widening credit spreads, higher interest rates and equity market volatility. Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivatives, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio: • Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 reflected losses due to increases in interest rates and widening of credit spreads, while the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 reflected gains, due to tightening of credit spreads. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in net losses driven by higher interest rates in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to net gains from interest rate declines in the same periods in the prior year.  • The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, reflected lower losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, which varied based on the relative change in equity market returns in the respective periods. DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC, including VOBA, within the Life and Retirement companies, excluding DAC of the Legacy Portfolio:     Six Months Ended June 30,                     (in millions)       2018       2017     Balance, beginning of year   $   7,637   $   7,571     Acquisition costs deferred       544       480     Amortization expense:                     Related to realized capital gains and losses       (27)       109     All other operating amortization       (471)       (427)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange       (10)       14     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments       831       (104)     Balance, end of period*   $   8,504   $   7,643    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $9.0 billion and $8.6 billion at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   150 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income (OCI) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow Loss Adjustments) with an offset to OCI to be recorded. Shadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.  Market interest rates increased in the six-month period ended June 30,2018, which resulted in a $6.7 billion decrease in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the Life and Retirement companies at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2018, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected increases in DAC and unearned revenues and a decrease in future policy benefit liabilities compared to December 31, 2017, while the shadow Loss Adjustments reflected a decrease in future policy benefit liabilities.

It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.  See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement in the 2017 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.  Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share and/or warrant repurchases.      AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 153       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ACTIVITY FOR the Six Months Ended june 30, 2018  Sources  AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries(a) During the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, AIG Parent received $2.1 billion in dividends from subsidiaries. Of this amount, $825 million consisted of dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our General Insurance companies, $1.2 billion consisted of dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash from our Life and Retirement companies and $21 million consisted of dividends in the form of cash from our Other category. AIG Parent also received a net amount of $819 million in tax sharing payments in the form of cash from our insurance businesses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, including $441 million of such payments in the second quarter of 2018. The tax sharing payments may be subject to adjustment in future periods. Debt Issuance In March 2018, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% Notes Due 2028; $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Notes Due 2048; and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Fixed-To-Floating Rate Series A-9 Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2048 (Junior Subordinated Debentures). We used the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Validus.  Uses(b)   Debt Reduction In May 2018, we redeemed all of our outstanding 8.000% Series A-7 Junior Subordinated Debentures and 8.625% Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures in each case for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, for approximately $15 million and $7 million, respectively. We also made other repurchases of and repayments on debt instruments of approximately $2.0 billion during the six-month period ended June 30, 2018. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $478 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2018. Dividend We paid a cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock during each of the first and second quarters of 2018 totaling $575 million over both quarters.  Repurchase of Common Stock(c) We repurchased approximately 12 million shares of AIG Common Stock during the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $646 million.     (a) In July 2018, we received approximately $210 million in additional dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our General Insurance companies. These dividends had been declared during the second quarter of 2018. (b) On July 18, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Validus for approximately $5.5 billion in cash. For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries.  (c) Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan, from July 1 to August 2, 2018, we repurchased approximately $149 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.      154 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash  The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:    Six Months Ended June 30,                             (in millions)               2018       2017     Sources:                             Net cash provided by other investing activities           $   -   $   14,725     Changes in policyholder contract balances               3,855       999     Issuance of long-term debt               3,504       2,221     Total sources               7,359       17,945     Uses:                              Net cash used in operating activities               (340)       (9,036)     Net cash used in other investing activities               (1,470)       -     Repayments of long-term debt               (1,959)       (1,606)     Purchases of AIG Common Stock               (646)       (6,000)     Dividends paid               (575)       (597)     Net cash used in other financing activities               (2,756)       (44)     Total uses               (7,746)       (17,283)     Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash               30       (25)     Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash           $   (357)   $   637    The following table presents a summary of AIG’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:    Six Months Ended June 30,                                 (in millions)                   2018       2017     Summary:                                  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities               $   (340)   $   (9,036)      Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                   (1,470)       14,725      Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                   1,423       (5,027)      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash                   30       (25)     Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash                   (357)       637     Cash and restricted cash at beginning of year                   2,737       2,107     Change in cash of businesses held for sale                   -       66     Cash and restricted cash at end of period               $   2,380   $   2,810    Operating Cash Flow Activities  Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $664 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $682 million in the same period in the prior year. Excluding interest payments, AIG had operating cash inflows of $324 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to operating cash outflows of $8.4 billion in the same period in the prior year. The operating cash outflow in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to payment for the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO.     AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 155       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Investing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash used in investing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 was $1.5 billion compared to investing cash inflows of $14.7 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. The six-month period ended June 30, 2017 included sales of certain investments to fund the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO. Financing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 reflected: • approximately $575 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2018; • approximately $646 million to repurchase approximately 12 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $1.5 billion in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 reflected: • approximately $597 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2017; • approximately $6.0 billion to repurchase approximately 95 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and  • approximately $615 million in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries AIG Parent As of June 30, 2018, AIG Parent had approximately $13.8 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management. In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.   156 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   June 30, 2018   December 31, 2017     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   6,152   $   2,114     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       3,124       5,172     Total AIG Parent liquidity       9,276       7,286     Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(c)       4,500       4,500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   13,776   $   11,786    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $2.8 billion and $1.7 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. (c) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility see Credit Facilities below. Closing of Validus Acquisition On July 18, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Validus for approximately $5.5 billion in cash from AIG Parent. Following the consummation of the acquisition, AIG executed a guarantee, dated July 26, 2018, with respect to Validus’ outstanding Series A Preference Shares and Series B Preference Shares (together, the Preference Shares), pursuant to which AIG provided a full and unconditional guarantee of Validus’ obligations with respect to the Preference Shares. In addition, AIG executed a guarantee, dated July 26, 2018, with respect to Validus’ aggregate outstanding 8.875% Senior Notes due 2040 (the Notes), pursuant to which AIG provided a full and unconditional guarantee of Validus’ obligations with respect to the Notes. AIG also entered into certain letter of credit agreements in support of the Validus companies. Insurance Companies We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements. Our General Insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. General Insurance companies had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs at June 30, 2018 and had outstanding borrowings in an aggregate amount of approximately $190 million at December 31, 2017. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from the FHLBs at June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017. In addition, $3.4 billion and $606 million were due to the FHLBs in the respective districts of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Institutional Markets operating segments, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits.    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 157       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Certain of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $1.6 billion and $2.9 billion of securities subject to these agreements at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In February 2018, AIG Parent entered into a CMA with DSA Re. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain available statutory capital and surplus of DSA Re’s long term business fund and its general business account at or above a stress threshold percentage of its projected enhanced capital requirement in respect of the applicable fund, as defined under Bermuda law. As of June 30, 2018, the stress threshold percentage under this CMA was 125 percent. AIG Parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions. These financial institutions issue letters of credit from time to time to certain of our General Insurance companies for insurance regulatory and reinsurance collateral purposes or for capital support, and the total outstanding amount of issued letters of credit for these purposes was approximately $2.4 billion at June 30, 2018. Letters of credit issued in support of the Life and Retirement companies totaled approximately $911 million at June 30, 2018. Letters of credit issued in support of DSA Re totaled $550 million at June 30, 2018. During 2016, we created a new Switzerland-domiciled international holding company, AIG International Holdings, GmbH (AIGIH), which is intended to be the ultimate holding company for all of our international entities. This international holding company structure is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify our organizational structure, and is expected to facilitate the optimization of our international capital strategy from both a regulatory and a tax perspective. Through August 2, 2018, substantially all of our international operations have been transferred to AIGIH. We will continue to monitor our international holding company structure in light of regulatory, tax and other developments, to ensure that this strategy continues to be effective. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, our General Insurance companies paid approximately $825 million in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. government and government-sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, our Life and Retirement companies collectively paid a total of $1.2 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash to AIG Parent.  Credit Facilities We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2022. As of June 30, 2018, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Facility. Our ability to utilize the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to utilize the Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.    158 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:    June 30, 2018           Payments due by Period              Total   Remainder of       2019 -       2021 -                     (in millions)       Payments        2018       2020       2022       2023       Thereafter     Insurance operations                                                     Loss reserves   $   78,668   $   17,848   $   22,582   $   12,620   $   4,124   $   21,494     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       242,595       10,201       31,249       29,177       13,323       158,645     Borrowings       988       -       119       227       -       642     Interest payments on borrowings       877       25       99       99       50       604     Other long-term obligations       -       -       -       -       -       -     Total   $   323,128   $   28,074   $   54,049   $   42,123   $   17,497   $   181,385     Other                                                      Borrowings   $   25,269   $   627   $   2,639   $   3,250   $   1,747   $   17,006     Interest payments on borrowings       16,032       743       2,083       1,808       824       10,574     Other long-term obligations       431       45       180       171       1       34     Total   $   41,732   $   1,415   $   4,902   $   5,229   $   2,572   $   27,614     Consolidated                                                     Loss reserves   $   78,668   $   17,848   $   22,582   $   12,620   $   4,124   $   21,494     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       242,595       10,201       31,249       29,177       13,323       158,645     Borrowings       26,257       627       2,758       3,477       1,747       17,648     Interest payments on borrowings       16,909       768       2,182       1,907       874       11,178     Other long-term obligations(a)       431       45       180       171       1       34     Total(b)   $   364,860   $   29,489   $   58,951   $   47,352   $   20,069   $   208,999    (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.7 billion. For additional information see Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Loss Reserves Loss reserves relate to our General Insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our General Insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life and Retirement companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life and Retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life and Retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 159       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Borrowings Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. For further information on indemnification obligations see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities. (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.   160 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     (e) Previously included a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $200 million between AerCap Ireland Capital Designated Activity Company, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility). AerCap Ireland Capital Designated Activity Company elected to terminate the AerCap Credit Facility, effective June 13, 2018. (f) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining annual pension contribution for 2018 is expected to be approximately $27 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Tax Matters If the settlement agreements in principle are concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. Although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.3 billion. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. There remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payments, which are not likely to be made before sometime in 2019. For additional information regarding this matter see Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities  We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.  For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.   164 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock  On February 8, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018. On May 2, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2018. On August 2, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on September 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on September 17, 2018. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, as discussed further in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase of $2.5 billion to the share repurchase authorization. As of August 2, 2018, approximately $1.5 billion remained under the authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $646 million pursuant to this authorization. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan, from July 1 to August 2, 2018, we repurchased approximately $149 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.    AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 165       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources      Dividend Restrictions  Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities.  For a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report.    Enterprise Risk Management  Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2017 Annual Report. Credit Risk Management Overview Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.  For further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures see Investments – Available-for-Sale Investments.   166 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Our credit risk management framework incorporates the following elements:     Risk Identification   including the ongoing capture and monitoring of all existing, contingent, potential and emerging credit risk exposures, whether funded or unfunded     Risk Measurement   comprising risk ratings, default probabilities, loss given default and expected loss parameters, exposure calculations, stress testing and other risk analytics     Risk Limits   including, but not limited to, a system of single obligor or risk group-based AIG-wide house limits and sub-limits for corporates, financial institutions, sovereigns and sub-sovereigns when appropriate and a defined process for identifying, evaluating, documenting and approving, if appropriate, breaches of and exceptions to such limits     Risk Delegations   a comprehensive credit risk delegation framework from the Chief Credit Officer (CCO) to authorized credit professionals throughout the company     Risk Evaluation, Monitoring and Reporting   including the ongoing analysis and assessment of credit risks, trending of those risks and reporting of other key risk metrics and limits to the CCO and senior management, as may be required     Credit Reserving   including but not limited to development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and (ii) other-than-temporary impairments for securities portfolios    Market Risk Management Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The Risk Officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Many of our market risk exposures related to interest rates and equity returns are associated with our Life and Retirement companies and relate to both asset and liability exposures. In addition, these exposures are long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. These interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.   AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 167       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Identification Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.  Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:     Equity prices   We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.     Residential and commercial real estate values   Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.     Interest rates   Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.     Credit spreads   Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.     Foreign exchange (FX) rates   We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.     Commodity prices   Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.     Inflation   Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.      168 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Measurement  Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis. In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.  We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:             Examples include:     Sensitivity analysis   measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input   • a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,  • a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and  • a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.     Scenario analysis   uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures   • a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, or  • a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets.  Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.     Stress testing   a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome   • the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.

Excluded were $9.1 billion of loans. In addition, $4.3 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2017, the analysis covered $276.8 billion of $289.6 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.2 billion of loans. In addition, $4.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. (b) At June 30, 2018, the analysis excluded $7.6 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $643 million of AIGLH borrowings and $346 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. At December 31, 2017, the analysis excluded $6.0 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $190 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $334 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. (c) The balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under “Interest rate sensitive liabilities” above, and are not additive. (d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above. We use duration and convexity metrics to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes for interest rate sensitive assets excluding derivatives and long-term debt. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity of a derivative is calculated as change in its value with respect to plus a 100 basis point change in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value of the derivative under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.  We evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which could produce different results.  We evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset-based fees, changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing DAC, or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products. In addition, this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy. Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.  Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at June 30, 2018, remained relatively flat compared to December 31, 2017. For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.  AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying stress conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.   AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 171       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Identification  The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.     Market/Monetization Risk   Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.     Cash Flow Mismatch Risk   Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.     Event Funding Risk   Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.     Financing Risk   We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.    Risk Measurement Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.  We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:     Minimum Liquidity Limits   Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in order to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.     Coverage Ratios   Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed stressed conditions and within the specified time horizon.     Cash Flow Forecasts   Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.     Stress Testing   Asset liquidity and Coverage Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.    Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.     172 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    Regulatory Environment   Overview Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. We expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. The Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA) regulates AIG’s operating (re)insurance subsidiaries in Bermuda. The Insurance Act 1978 and its related regulations (as amended, the Insurance Act), as enforced by the BMA, impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our Bermuda operating (re)insurance subsidiaries including: the filing of annual statutory financial returns; the filing of annual GAAP financial statements; compliance with minimum enhanced capital requirements; compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct; compliance with minimum solvency margins and liquidity ratios; limitations on dividends and distributions; preparation of an annual Financial Condition Report providing details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework, solvency and financial performance; and restrictions on certain changes in control of regulated (re)insurers. For updated information on the impact of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and the related regulatory developments regarding a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services, see Executive Summary – AIG’s Outlook – Industry and Economic Factors – Standard of Care Developments. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report.     AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 173       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Glossary  Accident year  The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs and certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting.  Additional premium represents a premium on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium imposed at the beginning of the policy. An additional premium may be assessed if the insured’s risk is found to have increased significantly. Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Assets under administration include assets under management and Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement mutual fund assets that we sell or administer.  Assets under management include assets in the general and separate accounts of our subsidiaries that support liabilities and surplus related to our life and annuity insurance products and the notional value of stable value wrap contracts. Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book value per common share excluding AOCI is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels. CVA Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in AIGFP's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only, without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk in the fair value measurement of all derivative net liability positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business.   174 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments  An adjustment to DAC and Reserves for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC and Unearned Revenue amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. An adjustment to benefit reserves for investment-oriented products is also recognized to reflect the application of the benefit ratio to the accumulated assessments that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (collectively referred to as “shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments”). For long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. General operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses. GIC/GIA Guaranteed Investment Contract/Guaranteed Investment Agreement A contract whereby the seller provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. G-SII Global Systemically Important Insurer An insurer that is deemed globally systemically important (that is, of such size, market importance and global interconnectedness that the distress or failure of the insurer would cause significant dislocation in the global financial system and adverse economic consequences across a range of countries) by the Financial Stability Board, in consultation with and based on a methodology developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.  Loss Ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.  Loss reserve development  The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to prior years as a result of the re-estimation of loss reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. Natural catastrophe and man-made losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Enterprise Risk Management.   ITEM 4 | Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2018. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.     178 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS        Part II – Other Information  ITEM 1 | Legal Proceedings For a discussion of legal proceedings see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 1A | Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the following risk factor, as well as the other risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2017 Annual Report. Our recently acquired reinsurance business exposes us to certain risks, many of which are similar to risks in our existing property casualty insurance business. These risks include the difficulty of estimating ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves related to reinsurance products; exposure to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events; exposure to risks related to the potential concentration of certain reinsurance contracts; the difficulty of adequately pricing reinsurance contracts; and potential downgrades in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our reinsurance subsidiaries. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  For further discussion, see the following risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2017 Annual Report:  · “Insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses”; · “Our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events”; · “Concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects”; · “Pricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate losses”; and · “A downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and retaining customers and business.”  In addition, if our reinsurance liabilities increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for insurance company clients. The need to post this additional collateral, if significant enough, may require us to sell investments at a loss in order to provide securities of suitable credit quality or otherwise secure adequate capital at an unattractive cost. This could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

(b) Reflects the purchase of 168,900 warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, which reduced the dollar value of the remaining repurchase authorization. (c) On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $2.5 billion to the share repurchase authorization. As of August 2, 2018, approximately $1.5 billion remained under the authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock under this authorization for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $348 million. We also repurchased 168,900 warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock during the three-month period ended June 30, 2018 for an aggregate purchase price of $2 million. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 plan, from July 1, 2018 to August 2, 2018, we have repurchased approximately $149 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock and $1 million of warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock.    ITEM 4 | Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. ITEM 5 | Other Information For 2018, we modified our executive compensation program to reflect our commitment to long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. Individual 2018 short-term incentive awards for the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) are based on metrics designed to emphasize business unit accountability and on an assessment of individual strategic and qualitative performance. Our 2018 long-term incentive (LTI) program for the ELT consists of performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options (weighted 50 percent, 25 percent and 25 percent, respectively). PSUs will be earned over a three-year performance period based on a mix of operating metrics consisting of improvement in Combined Ratio, growth in Core Book Value per Share and Core Normalized Return on Equity. In addition, annual LTI grant amounts for ELT members take into account an assessment of individual performance. We were not required to disclose the information reported under this Item 5 in a report on Form 8-K during the period covered by this Form 10-Q. The information reported by us under this Item 5 is provided because we deem it to be of importance to our shareholders and would have otherwise reported such information under Item 7.01 of Form 8-K, “Regulation FD.”        180 AIG | Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS        ITEM 6 | Exhibits
