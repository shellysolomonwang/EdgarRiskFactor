Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of AIG for the year ended December 31, 2010 (AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K).   AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  89      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Use of Non-GAAP Measures    Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of ongoing operations as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations.   In light of its significant divestiture and restructuring related activities, AIG defines after-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG to exclude income (loss) from any discontinued operations, income (loss) from divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment, net gain (loss) on sale of divested business, amortization of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) prepaid commitment fee asset, goodwill impairment charges arising from divestiture-related activities, realized capital gains (losses) net of the SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) offset, bargain purchase gains, the effect of non-qualifying derivative hedging gains (losses), and deferred income tax valuation allowance charges and releases. AIG believes that this measure of after-tax operating income (loss) permits a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of its businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses, without the distortive effects of the highly unusual events that have affected AIG since 2008. A reconciliation of after-tax operating income attributable to AIG to net income attributable to AIG for the year ended December 31, 2010 is set forth below.   AIG has set certain long-term goals for operating return on equity (ROE) and annual percentage growth rate of operating earnings per share (EPS) that are calculated using after-tax operating income (loss), as defined above. ROE is defined as after-tax operating income attributable to AIG as a percentage of AIG adjusted shareholders' equity (which is shareholder's equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income). EPS is defined as after-tax operating income attributable to AIG divided by AIG's diluted weighted average outstanding shares. AIG focuses on these measures because it believes they provide the most effective means for assessing AIG's business performance against its long-term aspirational goals. To the extent that the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below constitute forward-looking information, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP is not available without unreasonable efforts.   AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis, Inc. (Chartis) using underwriting profit (loss). Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization and goodwill impairment charges, is utilized to report results for SunAmerica operations. Management believes that these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.       Executive Overview    This executive overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of AIG's financial statements. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety, together with AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  AIG reports the results of its operations through the following reportable segments:    •Chartis — AIG's property and casualty operations are conducted through multiple-line companies writing substantially all commercial and consumer lines both domestically and abroad. Chartis offers its products through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes agents, wholesalers, global and local brokers, and direct-to-consumer platforms. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, reporting includes the results of Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji), a recently consolidated business which writes primarily consumer lines in Japan.   •SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) — SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, accident and health (A&H), fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers   90      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms.    •Financial Services — AIG's financial services businesses engage primarily in commercial aircraft leasing through International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and the management of the remaining Capital Markets derivatives portfolios through AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP).        Highlights of Restructuring Activities   AIG substantially completed its recapitalization plan (the Recapitalization) and its asset disposition plan with the following significant milestones in 2011:    •On January 14, 2011 (the Closing), AIG completed the Recapitalization, which included:      •repaying the $20.7 billion outstanding balance and terminating the credit facility provided by the FRBNY (such credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility). As a result of the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility, AIG recorded a net $3.3 billion pre-tax charge for a loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2011, primarily representing the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset;   •applying proceeds from the AIA Group Limited (AIA) initial public offering and the American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) sale to partially repay the U.S. government's ownership interests in special purpose vehicles that held AIA and ALICO (the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV, respectively, and collectively, the SPVs). As part of the Recapitalization, AIG used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to repay a portion of the liquidation preference and accrued return of the SPV Preferred Interests. The SPV Preferred Interests were further reduced during the first quarter of 2011 by approximately $9.1 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star), AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) and the sale of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities received in the sale of ALICO, in each case, discussed below; and   •exchanging preferred stock held by the Department of the Treasury and the AIG Credit Facility Trust (the Trust) for AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock).     •On January 12, 2011, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent interest in Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) to a Taiwan-based consortium for $2.16 billion in cash, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions. Discussions with regulators and other interested parties are ongoing.   •On January 31, 2011, ILFC entered into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility. On March 30, 2011, ILFC entered into a secured $1.3 billion term loan with the right to add an additional $200 million of lender commitments. On April 21, 2011, ILFC increased its secured $1.3 billion term loan for a total commitment of $1.5 billion.   •On February 1, 2011, AIG completed the sale of its Japan-based life insurance subsidiaries, AIG Star and AIG Edison, to Prudential Financial, Inc., for $4.8 billion, consisting of $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in the assumption of third-party debt.   •On March 8, 2011, AIG completed the disposition of MetLife securities received upon the sale of ALICO to MetLife and used $6.6 billion of the proceeds to repay all of the liquidation preference and accrued return of the Department of the Treasury's ALICO SPV Preferred Interests and a portion of the liquidation preference and accrued return of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.   •On April 20, 2011, Chartis announced that it entered into an agreement with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' U.S. asbestos   91      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   liabilities will be transferred to NICO. At the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis will cede the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis will pay NICO approximately $1.65 billion in respect of the cession. Subject to required regulatory approvals, execution of definitive transaction documentation and satisfaction of other conditions, this transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011.     See Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Notes 1, 4 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.       Long-Term Aspirational Goals   Following the completion of the Recapitalization, AIG is developing business plans for its operations in relation to certain long-term aspirational goals. Among the most significant of AIG's enterprise-wide long-term aspirational goals are the following:    •to increase its ROE to 10 percent or more by the year ended December 31, 2015, from its 6.2 percent normalized ROE as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010; and   •to achieve average annual percentage growth of its EPS in the mid-teens through the year ended December 31, 2015, from normalized EPS of $2.62 for the year ended December 31, 2010.    ROE and EPS in this context are the non-GAAP measures described above. The calculation of ROE and EPS for the year ended December 31, 2010 which is used as a baseline was determined by making certain adjustments to after-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG, as described in the reconciliation below, to calculate normalized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG. The baseline ROE was calculated using adjusted shareholders' equity reduced by the net prepaid commitment fee asset remaining at December 31, 2010 and assuming full conversion of AIG's Equity Units, as described in the reconciliation below. All amounts or percentages in this section are approximate.   These aspirational goals are premised on a number of significant assumptions, including the following assumptions, and are by their nature subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are outside AIG's control:    •AIG's goal is to generate, by seeking to take advantage of global opportunities, approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental aggregate pre-tax operating income in 2015 compared to its normalized pre-tax operating income for 2010. AIG's goals are to continue to strengthen and grow its businesses by seeking to capitalize on global opportunities, maintaining well-positioned broad franchises in appropriate markets, diversifying AIG's businesses in product and geography and utilizing AIG's underwriting skills across multiple lines and multiple geographies. The achievement of this goal is dependent upon improved performance by AIG's businesses. In particular, for this goal, AIG assumes that:      •Chartis will have achieved an average annual growth rate in net premiums written of approximately 6 percent from 2010 to 2015, and, by the year ended December 31, 2015, a combined ratio of between 90 and 95, which would result in an unleveraged return on equity of 10 to 12 percent (assuming an annual investment yield of approximately 4 percent) for the year ended December 31, 2015.   •SunAmerica will have achieved by the year ended December 31, 2015, assets under management of $320 billion and life insurance in force of $1 trillion, which would result in an unleveraged return on equity of 9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015. These compare to assets under management of $249 billion and life insurance in force of $909 billion at December 31, 2010 and an unleveraged return on equity of 7.4 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010 (normalized to exclude the Maiden Lane II and call and tender income adjustments described in the table below).   •The goals of ILFC and UGC are to achieve improvements in their businesses to enable them to contribute to the growth in AIG's after-tax operating income.     92      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     •AIG's interests in Maiden Lane III will have produced an annual pre-tax return of approximately 9 percent.       •The goals of AIG's investment strategy include generating approximately $500 million to $700 million in additional annual pre-tax net investment income by fully investing its investable cash. At December 31, 2010, AIG had approximately $21 billion of investable cash, a large portion of which was originally intended to be used for the purchase of the Maiden Lane II securities. As of March 31, 2011, this investable cash had been reduced to approximately $14 billion. Had AIG been fully invested during 2010, AIG estimates that its net investment income for 2010 would have been approximately $500 to $700 million higher. AIG has been actively redeploying its investable cash into higher yielding assets with the goal of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns in relation to its insurance liabilities. AIG assumes it will achieve an average yield of 4 percent to 5 percent on those new cash investments by employing AIG's current investment strategy.   •The goal of AIG's cost rationalization effort is to reduce AIG's annual general and administration expenses by approximately $1 billion by the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2010 expenses. AIG has made and expects to continue to make substantial investments in infrastructure to serve its business portfolio efficiently and eliminate redundancies, including its information technology, finance, underwriting and claims infrastructure, and is also expanding its sourcing capabilities globally.   •AIG's goal is to generate through December 31, 2015 approximately $25 billion to $30 billion of deployable capital to be applied to, among other things, potential share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or organic business opportunities. For purposes of setting the ROE and EPS goals, such capital deployment has been assumed to take the form of share repurchases without material increase in financial leverage or reduction in interest coverage. Any share repurchase programs approved by AIG's Board of Directors and regulators are expected to be sufficiently flexible such that they may be modified in the event of a major catastrophic loss, significant change in the underwriting cycle or change in future investment performance. To the extent that AIG applies this deployable capital for dividend payments, acquisitions or organic business opportunities, rather than for share repurchases, AIG may not be able to achieve its aspirational ROE and EPS goals.    In setting these aspirational goals, AIG has made significant assumptions with respect to, among other things, the general conditions of markets in which it operates, revenues and combined ratios of its subsidiaries, investment yields, subsidiaries' capacity to distribute dividends to AIG Parent, AIG's ability to apply deployable capital to share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or organic growth, AIG's ability to maintain financial leverage commensurate with its current credit ratings, the exclusion of the impact on shareholders' equity of the reversal of the tax valuation allowance, the effectiveness of AIG's cost rationalization measures, the approval of planned actions (including with respect to any share repurchases, dividend payments or acquisitions) by AIG's regulators, the overall credit rating implications of AIG's proposed strategic actions and general financial market and interest rate conditions. Given the significance of the assumptions used and the uncertainties surrounding them, there are significant risks that these assumptions may not be realized and thus the aspirational goals may not be achieved. Accordingly, AIG's actual results are likely to differ from these goals and the differences may be material and adverse. The aspirational goals and their underlying assumptions are forward-looking statements. AIG strongly cautions its shareholders and other investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or goals. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any assumptions, goals, projections or other related statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in AIG's 2010 Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these forward-looking statements.   The Long-Term Aspirational Goals section included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, AIG. AIG's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has neither examined, compiled nor performed any procedures with respect to the  93      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  accompanying Long-Term Aspirational Goals information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.  The following table reconciles Net income attributable to AIG to Normalized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG for the year ended December 31, 2010:                      Year Ended December 31, 2010 (dollars in millions, except share data)                Net income attributable to AIG   $ 7,786      Less:              Net gains (losses) on sale of divested businesses     13,527        Amortization of FRBNY prepaid commitment fee asset     (2,255 )      Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax     (2,118 )      Net income from divested businesses (mainly AIA)     1,657        Deferred income tax valuation allowance charge     (1,517 )      Net realized capital gains (losses), net of SunAmerica DAC offset     (915 )      Bargain purchase gain     332        Non-qualifying derivative hedging gains / losses     (27 )          After-tax operating loss attributable to AIG   $ (898 )    Less:              Prior year loss reserve development     (2,364 )      Noncontrolling nonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests     (1,818 )      Aircraft impairments and lease related charges     (1,108 )      Maiden Lane III fair value change in excess of 9 percent annual return     900        Credit valuation adjustment on Direct Investment Business     610        Tax effect of difference between book and tax realized capital gains (losses)     (574 )      FRBNY Credit Facility interest expense     (413 )      Real estate impairments     (393 )      Restructuring expense     (337 )      Maiden Lane II fair value change in excess of 9 percent annual return     294        Call and tender income in excess of 5-year average     141        Other     (548 )          Normalized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG   $ 4,712            Outstanding shares of AIG common stock as of January 14, 2011     1,795,501,842      Normalized EPS   $ 2.62      Total shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010   $  85,319      Less:              Accumulated other comprehensive income     7,624        Net FRBNY prepaid commitment fee asset     3,328        Conversion of Equity Units     (2,169 )          Adjusted shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010   $ 76,536      Normalized ROE     6.2 %                  Priorities for 2011   AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2011:   •continuing to strengthen and grow AIG's businesses;   •executing one or more primary offerings of AIG Common Stock;   •implementing plans to maximize the value of resources available for repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury;   •continuing to build, strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources;  94      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  •restructuring AIG's operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness;   •managing its capital more efficiently;   •investing its available cash in order to increase its net investment income;   •streamlining operations and controlling expenses;   •completing the active unwind of AIGFP's portfolios by June 30, 2011; and   •closing the Nan Shan sale.       Chartis    Given current property and casualty industry capital levels and overall economic conditions, 2011 is anticipated to be a challenging year as Chartis expects a weak growth environment in most developed economies. The weakness of ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls, and sales) in 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base, as well as continued weakness in U.S. commercial insurance rates, are likely to continue well into 2011. However, in the first quarter of 2011, Chartis has observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the United States is beginning to abate. In certain growth economies such as Brazil, Turkey, India, and Asia Pacific countries, Chartis expects improved growth rates.   In 2011, Chartis continues to execute on its strategy of growing its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business and, as required, implementing corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management continues to review its underlying businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures while seeking to reduce the overall volatility of results. In connection with these ongoing reviews, during the three months ended March 31, 2011, management took certain remedial actions relating to certain Consumer line programs that did not meet internal performance or operating targets, including the decision to reduce its net premiums written for two specific programs. Notwithstanding these actions, Chartis U.S. expects to continue to grow its Consumer lines business and, excluding these specific actions, the overall Consumer business continues to see growth in line with management's expectations.   To the extent that the aforementioned ratable exposures continue to improve, Chartis U.S. expects moderate growth in both gross and net written premiums in 2011. Chartis U.S. expects continued growth within its Consumer lines business and an overall decline in certain classes of its Commercial lines businesses. Because the consumer lines of business generally carry higher origination costs than commercial lines, Chartis U.S. expects an overall increase in its expense ratio due to the change in mix of business. However, these increases are expected to be largely offset by on-going expense saving initiatives that were introduced in 2010.   Chartis International expects continued growth of its net written premiums in 2011. Given its well-established franchises and operations, expectations for continued globalization and growth in the gross domestic product within countries included in the Growth Economies region, Chartis International intends to increase its insurance penetration and growth within commercial liability businesses overseas. This growth is expected in the Far East and Growth Economies regions. Strong pricing discipline in a continued soft market is expected to keep the Europe region net written premiums at levels consistent with 2010. Far East growth in 2011 is expected to be attributable in part to the full-year inclusion of the Fuji results of operations, compared to only six months of results in 2010. Further, in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Fuji in 2010, Chartis recognized certain net intangible liabilities related to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the insurance contracts acquired.   On February 10, 2011, Chartis announced a cash tender offer for the 45.2 percent of outstanding Fuji shares that it did not already own, as well as outstanding stock acquisition rights. As a result of the offer, at March 31, 2011, Chartis owned 98.4 percent of the aggregate shares of Fuji. Chartis intends ultimately to acquire the remaining minority shares, making Fuji a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chartis. This acquisition is consistent with Chartis' strategy to diversify its portfolio of businesses on both a geographic and product line basis and is intended to strengthen Chartis' position in the consolidating Japanese market, while enabling Fuji to benefit from Chartis' global operational resources and financial strength. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  95      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake occurred near the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan, triggering a tsunami in the Pacific Ocean. This disaster is now named the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami (the Tohoku Catastrophe).  The following table summarizes Chartis charges related to the Tohoku Catastrophe:                           Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 (in millions)   Chartis U.S.*   Chartis International   Total            Claims and claims adjustment expenses   $ 434   $ 864   $ 1,298      Reinsurance reinstatement premiums     (4 )   43     39            Total   $ 430   $ 907   $ 1,337               * Chartis U.S. losses included approximately $200 million relating to reinsurance protection it provides to Chartis International as part of Chartis' overall capital management and reinsurance strategies. Chartis U.S. received reinstatement premiums of $25 million from Chartis International in connection with this protection.   The claims and claims adjustment expenses above include $436 million relating to Chartis' participation in the Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance Company (JERC). The JERC is a joint government-private sector insurance system that is the exclusive provider of earthquake coverage for personal dwellings and their contents in Japan. Under the JERC system, a maximum of 5.5 trillion Yen ($67 billion at the March 31, 2011 exchange rate) of industry-wide losses will be covered by the Japanese government, the JERC, and private, general insurance companies in Japan through five layers of liability. Fuji is a 6.2 percent shareholder of the JERC. As such, Fuji, in accordance with Japanese statutory accounting rules, as well as the requirements of private sector participants in the JERC, had previously established reserves of approximately $482 million for potential claims associated with earthquake damage to personal dwellings. These reserves, which are backed by funds held by the JERC, exist to cover the potential losses that Fuji could sustain in connection with JERC-related claims. Given these statutory reserves, and its current estimate of losses, Chartis expects minimal net effects on the statutory capital and liquidity of its Japanese operations.   The Tohoku Catastrophe caused significant damage to Japan's transportation, power, manufacturing and service sectors and resulted in disruptions to supply chains, particularly in the technology and automobile industries. These disruptions may result in contingent business interruption (CBI) claims from insureds.   Generally, CBI coverage reimburses insureds for loss of business income or extra expense as a result of physical damage sustained by a supplier. The insured's supplier must have sustained physical damage by a peril otherwise covered by the insured's property policy and subject to its respective policy terms and conditions. Potential CBI losses are difficult to initially ascertain due to the unique facts and circumstances of each insured's supply chain and the specific conditions of its CBI coverage.   Chartis believes that the estimated loss liabilities for this catastrophe, including reserves established for CBI claims and JERC-related losses, are reasonable. However, given the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe and the inherent nature of the underlying claims, the subsequent development of these liabilities in future periods could vary materially from amounts included in the accompanying financial statements.   In addition to its policyholder obligations, Chartis responded to the Tohoku Catastrophe with humanitarian and financial assistance through its extensive networks in Japan and abroad.   On April 20, 2011, Chartis announced that it had entered into an agreement with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' U.S. asbestos liabilities will be transferred to NICO as part of Chartis' ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk. The transaction with NICO covers potentially volatile U.S.-related asbestos exposures. The transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that Chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by Chartis affiliates.   Upon the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis will cede the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis will pay NICO approximately $1.65 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO will assume approximately $1.85 billion of net asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, Chartis expects to record a  96      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  deferred gain of approximately $200 million in the second quarter 2011, which will be deferred and amortized into the Chartis results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims.   Subject to required regulatory approvals, execution of definitive transaction documentation, and satisfaction of other conditions, this transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011.   Chartis presents its financial information in the manner by which the business is currently being managed, with Chartis U.S. and Chartis International as the primary units included in the segment. On March 31, 2011 AIG announced a reorganization of its Chartis operations and named a new management team. Under the new structure, Chartis will consist of two major global groups — commercial and consumer — with the supporting claims, actuarial, and underwriting disciplines integrated into these two major business operations. In addition, Chartis will be organized geographically as four principal regions: the United States & Canada, Europe, the Far East, and Growth Economies (primarily Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America). As the new structure is implemented, the presentation of Chartis results will be modified accordingly and prior periods' presentations will be conformed. Chartis currently anticipates that the completion of its organization and operating design and related segment reporting changes will be completed in the third quarter of 2011.       SunAmerica    SunAmerica intends in 2011 to expand its distribution capabilities, reposition its excess cash and liquidity, maintain a strong statutory surplus, pro-actively manage expenses and, subject to regulatory approval, increase dividends paid to AIG Parent. SunAmerica made progress on all of these fronts during the first quarter of 2011.   SunAmerica built up a large cash and short-term position with the desire to purchase assets from the Maiden Lane II portfolio. With the FRBNY's decision to sell the MLII assets through a competitive sales process, SunAmerica began to acquire other fixed income investments that generally had lower investment yields. SunAmerica intends to improve net investment income results in 2011 by investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer-term higher-yielding securities to improve spreads, while actively managing credit and liquidity risks. SunAmerica made progress in the latter part of the first quarter of 2011 reducing its cash and short-term investment position from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2010 to $13.1 billion at March 31, 2011.   After a period of historic lows, interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first quarter of 2011. This change in the interest rate environment increased the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. Should interest rates remain at first quarter 2011 levels or continue to rise, SunAmerica believes that its fixed annuity sales should remain strong in 2011.   SunAmerica has experienced an increase in its variable annuity sales as various distribution partners have resumed sales of SunAmerica's products during 2010 and 2011. SunAmerica recently announced that its largest pre-financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner has agreed to resume distribution of SunAmerica's products in mid-2011. As a result of broader distribution opportunities and improvement in the equity markets, SunAmerica expects continued improvement in its variable annuity sales.   The estimated gross profits used to amortize Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC), Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) and Sales Inducement Assets (SIA) are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. Estimated gross profit is comprised of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains and losses. SunAmerica uses a reversion to mean methodology to account for fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business. Continued favorable separate account returns could trigger a favorable unlocking, where the reversion to mean assumption is reset. If current favorable equity market returns continue in 2011, such an unlocking could occur in 2011, which could result in higher amortization requirements in future periods. Such positive unlocking is not expected to be significant to SunAmerica's operating results.   SunAmerica focuses on identifying cost effective opportunities to manage its intercompany reinsurance transactions, particularly with respect to certain redundant statutory reserve requirements on term insurance and universal life with secondary guarantees (XXX and AXXX reserves). For this purpose, SunAmerica had a $2.65 billion syndicated letter of credit facility and $215 million of letters of credit on a bilateral basis outstanding at March 31, 2011, all of which relate to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. All of these letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015. During the quarter, SunAmerica modified certain of these intercompany reinsurance agreements to extend the reinsurance benefits, increase capacity and reduce costs.  97                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Financial Services        ILFC    ILFC continues to execute on its strategy to manage its fleet of aircraft, and expects to continue selling certain aircraft throughout the year. Depending on market conditions and the specific aircraft that may be sold, ILFC may incur additional losses on sales or record asset impairment charges, although these are not currently expected to be at the level of charges recognized in 2010.       AIGFP    AIG expects the active unwind of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011, and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio will consist predominantly of transactions AIG believes will be of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. The cost and liquidity needs of executing the AIGFP portfolio wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.       Other Operations        Mortgage Guaranty    United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) aims to continue to improve its book of business aided by differentiated pricing and improvements in underwriting practices. UGC continues to deny claims and rescind coverage on loans (collectively referred to as rescissions) in situations related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly with respect to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations have resulted in loan rescissions totaling $211 million of claims on first-lien business during the first three months of 2011 compared to $80 million during the same period in 2010. Although rescissions will continue to affect UGC's financial results, they have declined as a percentage of claims due to a higher level of appeals and overturns resulting from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. Although these items may increase volatility in the future, AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans after consideration of rescissions and overturns, consistent with industry practice.   Foreclosure moratoriums as a result of state attorneys' general investigations into lenders' foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 may affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is unclear and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any of these actions individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition.   In March 2011, federal regulators (as required by the Dodd-Frank Act) issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) whereby a maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80 percent is required for a home purchase transaction. The LTV is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan. The final regulations, depending on the conclusive definition of a QRM, the maximum LTV allowed and the benefit, if any, prescribed to the presence of private mortgage insurance, could materially adversely impact UGC's volume of domestic first lien new insurance written.       Direct Investment Business    During 2011, AIG expects to continue the exit and wind-down of non-strategic assets within the Global Real Estate investment portfolio. AIG carefully evaluates each investment within the portfolio with a view towards optimizing the value of higher quality assets by considering the risk adjusted returns, overall investment risks and  98      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  funding commitment, among other aspects. This strategy may extend the hold times for certain assets within the portfolio in order to maximize returns.

Premiums    Premiums decreased primarily due to the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase in Chartis premiums, which reflects the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010.       Policy Fees    Policy fees increased primarily due to higher variable annuity fees on the separate account assets consistent with the growth in variable accounts assets as a result of positive equity market conditions in 2010 through the first quarter of 2011.  100      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Net Investment Income        The following table summarizes the components of Net investment income:                             Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011   2010   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Fixed maturities, including short-term investments    $ 2,691    $ 3,581      (25 )%    ML II      251      160      57      ML III      744      751      (1 )    Change in fair value of AIA securities      1,062      -      -      Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to the sale      (157 )    -      -      Other equity securities      41      53      (23 )    Interest on mortgage and other loans      267      341      (22 )    Partnerships      654      381      72      Mutual funds      49      14      250      Real estate      25      26      (4 )    Other investments      69      19      263            Total investment income before policyholder income and trading gains      5,696      5,326      7      Policyholder investment income and trading gains (losses)      -      (75 )    -            Total investment income      5,696      5,251      8      Investment expenses      127      51      149            Net investment income    $ 5,569    $ 5,200      7 %            Net investment income increased primarily due to fair value gains on the investment in AIA securities and higher income from partnership investments due to an improved market environment, partially offset by the effect of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Aircraft Leasing Revenue    Aircraft leasing revenue decreased due to a reduction in the size of ILFC's aircraft fleet under operating leases as a result of the sales of aircraft throughout 2010 and 2011. At March 31, 2011, ILFC had 933 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 993 at March 31, 2010.       Other Income    Other income includes unrealized gains and losses on derivatives including unrealized market valuation gains and losses associated with Capital Markets' super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio as well as income from Asset Management operations. Other income increased due to:    •an increase of $204 million in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio resulting primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price improvement and amortization of the underlying assets;   •increases in credit valuation adjustments on Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities and Direct Investment business assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value, of $206 million and $58 million, respectively, resulting from the net effect of changes in credit spreads; and   •the effects of the continued wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio.    These increases were partially offset by the effect of a bargain purchase gain of $332 million recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   See Segment Results — Financial Services Operations — Financial Services Results — Capital Markets Results and Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred    Policyholder benefits and claims incurred increased primarily due to higher catastrophe losses for Chartis, primarily resulting from the Tohoku Catastrophe, partially offset by the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010.       Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs    The decline in amortization of Deferred acquisition costs primarily results from the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010.       Other Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses    Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased slightly as a result of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010.       Interest Expense    Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  102      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Aircraft Leasing Expenses    Aircraft leasing expenses decreased due to lower asset impairment and operating lease related charges recorded on aircraft. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, ILFC recorded asset impairment and operating lease related charges of $113 million on certain aircraft related primarily to sales and potential sales of 10 aircraft. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment and operating lease related charges of $431 million related to aircraft agreed to be sold.       Loss on Extinguishment of Debt    The loss on extinguishment of debt for the first quarter of 2011 represents a $3.3 billion charge, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Other Expenses    Other expenses includes expenses associated with Capital Markets, Asset Management and AIG Parent. Other expenses decreased due to:    •lower operating costs for the Institutional Asset Management business due to the effect of deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of AIG's third party asset management business; and   •lower provisions for credit losses for consumer finance businesses not presented as discontinued operations.        Income Tax Benefits        Interim Tax Calculation Method    Beginning with the first quarter of 2011, AIG utilized the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. The recent stabilization of operations and expected financial results allows AIG to estimate the annual effective tax rate to be applied to year-to-date income.   Since the third quarter of 2008, the discrete period method was utilized due to the significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre-tax accounting income, which were partly due to the effects of AIG's asset disposition program and restructuring.   Included in the estimated annual effective rate is a full valuation allowance against the tax expense of the U.S. consolidated income tax group, and statutory rates were used for computing the tax expense of foreign subsidiaries.   Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to that item is treated discretely, and is reported in the same period as the related item. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, the tax effects of the loss on extinguishment of debt, other-than-temporary impairments, realized capital gains and losses, the sale of Met Life securities, and divestiture gains or losses were treated as discrete items.       Interim Tax Expense (Benefit)    For the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations was 14.5 percent. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations for the U.S. consolidated income tax group, tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, investments in partnerships, and changes in uncertain tax positions.  103      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  For the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on the pre-tax income from continuing operations was (27.2) percent. The effective tax rate was negative because AIG recorded a tax benefit on pre-tax income. The tax benefit was primarily due to decreases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from changes in the expected taxable gain on subsidiaries to be sold, the tax benefit associated with tax exempt interest, and the bargain purchase gain associated with the acquisition of Fuji.   See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Discontinued Operations        Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations consists of the following:                          Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011   2010            Foreign life insurance businesses*    $ 542    $ 757      AGF      -      44      Net gain (loss) on sale      1,594      (107 )    Consolidation adjustments      (1 )    (113 )    Interest allocation      (2 )    (19 )          Income from discontinued operations    $ 2,133    $ 562      Income tax expense      480      219            Income from discontinued operations, net of tax    $ 1,653    $ 343               * Represents results of ALICO, AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan.    Results from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 include a pre-tax gain of $1.9 billion on the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Segment Results   AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis, using underwriting profit (loss). AIG analyzes the operating performance of SunAmerica using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization and goodwill impairment charges. Results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses are excluded from these measures. AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.  104      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment.

Chartis U.S. distributes its products in the United States and Canada through independent retail and wholesale brokers, and writes business on both an admitted and surplus line basis. Chartis U.S. business is conducted through American Home Assurance Company, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA, Lexington Insurance Company, the market leader in surplus lines, and certain other property-casualty insurance company subsidiaries.   Chartis International writes commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of agencies, branches and foreign based insurance subsidiaries. Chartis International uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines of insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs.

Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies for short duration contracts. The unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally recognized in earnings ratably over the policy period. Net premiums written for long duration contracts are earned when due from the policyholder. Net premiums written reflect the premiums retained after purchasing reinsurance protection.   AIG, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses, which consist of acquisition costs plus other insurance expenses, divided by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is a sum of loss ratio and expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expenses, and other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.   The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio.  106      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Chartis Net Premiums Written       The following table presents Chartis net premiums written by major line of business:                              Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011   2010   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Consumer lines:                          Accident & health    $ 1,523    $ 1,389      10 %      Personal lines      1,676      1,029      63        Life insurance      181      -      -            Total Consumer lines      3,380      2,418      40            Commercial lines:                          Casualty      2,515      2,189      15        Property      918      863      6        Specialty      2,353      2,174      8            Total Commercial lines      5,786      5,226      11            Total net premiums written    $ 9,166    $ 7,644      20 %            Chartis' net premiums written increased in the first three months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to growth in both Consumer and Commercial lines of business. Growth in both lines is primarily related to the acquisition of Fuji. For the three months ended March 31, 2011 Fuji contributed net premiums written of approximately $1 billion, of which $0.9 billion relates to Consumer lines and $0.1 billion relates to Commercial (Casualty) lines. Excluding Fuji, net premiums written increased approximately 7 percent over the comparable 2010 three-month period.   Excluding Fuji, Consumer lines increased 3 percent over the comparable 2010 period, as Chartis continues to execute on its strategy of growing its higher margin, less capital intensive classes of business and as appropriate, taking corrective actions, including exiting certain classes of underperforming businesses.   Excluding Fuji, overall Commercial lines increased approximately $460 million or 9 percent over the comparable 2010 period. Similarly, Casualty lines increased $226 million or 10 percent excluding Fuji, primarily reflecting improvements in ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls and sales), general rate improvement and retrospective premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts for Chartis U.S.   Management continues to execute on its plan to reduce its exposure to certain classes of its Casualty lines of business. As an example, at March 31, 2011 policies-in-force for Chartis U.S. specialty workers' compensation business decreased approximately 9 percent from the comparable 2010 three-month period. Further, excluding the effects of 2011 rate increases, and exposure and retrospective based premium adjustments, as of March 31, 2011, specialty workers' compensation premium decreased 6 percent compared to the 2010 three-month period.   The increase in Property net premiums written reflects the effects of continued execution of reinsurance strategies designed to reduce overall costs, maintain limits consistent with prior years, minimize credit exposure and reduce probable maximum losses. In connection with this strategy, a property quota share treaty was not renewed in 2011, resulting in an increase in Property net premiums written of approximately $38 million.   The increase in Specialty net premiums written is due primarily to the issuance of a large Chartis U.S. errors and omissions policy.   Overall, Chartis continues to see improved retention ratios, new business submissions, and a relatively stable rate environment across all of its major product lines and regions.  107      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies.

Also, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, Chartis recorded net adverse prior year development of $23 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $37 million relating to loss sensitive insurance contracts and including reserve discount charges of $34 million). During the three months ended March 31, 2010, Chartis recorded net favorable prior year loss development of $185 million (net of returned premium adjustments of $59 million relating to loss sensitive contracts), primarily relating to short tail lines of business (primarily for property lines of business).

Expense ratio:   The improvement in the overall expense ratio is due in large part to the net benefits of the amortization of the net intangible liabilities relating to the acquisition of Fuji. For the three months ended, March 31, 2011, Fuji reported an expense ratio of 19.8. Excluding Fuji, the overall expense ratio of 30.5 is generally consistent with the comparable 2010 period, as decreases in Chartis U.S. were offset by increases in Chartis International. The increase in Chartis International relates to costs that are consistent with management's strategic objectives, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, global accounting and claims systems initiatives and Solvency II readiness.   Chartis Investing and Other Results   For the three months ended March 31, 2011, net investment income for Chartis increased due to the acquisition of Fuji, which contributed $78 million of net investment income in the current year period. Additionally, returns on partnership investments improved by $92 million compared to the same period in 2010 as general market conditions continued to improve.   Net realized capital gains declined in the 2011 period as compared to the same period in 2010 due primarily to a decrease in realized gains within the Chartis International fixed maturity securities portfolio. The bargain purchase gain of $332 million in 2010 relates to the acquisition of Fuji.

Loss-sensitive business relates to policies whose premiums vary with the level of underlying losses. Accordingly, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, additional premiums of $37 million were recorded because a comparable amount of additional prior year losses were recognized. Conversely, the comparable 2010 three-month period includes returned premiums of $59 million because insured loss experience emerged more favorably;   •an increase of $62 million due to improvement in ratable exposures compared to the weakness these exposures experienced in 2009 and 2010. Certain workers' compensation policies are subject to final determination of premiums after the policy has expired and Chartis re-evaluates (audits) the underlying ratable exposure (i.e., payroll). Given the decline in these exposures in 2009 and 2010 due to generally weak economic conditions, audits conducted in 2010 of policies issued in 2009 resulted in returned premiums of approximately $54 million. In 2011, final premium audits on policies written in 2010 resulted in additional premiums due Chartis of $8 million;   110                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    •an increase in Property net premiums written reflecting the effects of continued execution of reinsurance strategies designed to reduce overall costs, maintain limits consistent with prior years, minimize credit exposure and reduce probable maximum losses. In connection with this strategy, a property quota share treaty was not renewed in 2011, resulting in an increase in Property net premiums written of approximately $38 million;   •an increase in Specialty net premiums written due primarily to the issuance of a large errors and omissions policy.    Growing the higher margin Consumer lines of business continues to be a key Chartis U.S. strategy. Where Consumer line programs do not meet internal performance or operating targets, management takes appropriate remedial actions, including in the first quarter of 2011, the decision to de-emphasize two specific programs, resulting in a decline in Consumer lines net premiums written in the quarter. Excluding the effects of these de-emphasized programs, the Chartis U.S. Consumer lines business continues to see growth in line with management's expectations.       Chartis U.S. Underwriting Ratios       The following table presents Chartis U.S. GAAP combined ratios:                             Three Months Ended March 31,   2011   2010   Increase (Decrease)            Loss ratio      91.5      76.2      15.3      Expense ratio      24.4      26.3      (1.9 )          Combined ratio      115.9      102.5      13.4             The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss sensitive contracts on the Chartis U.S. loss ratio:                            Three Months Ended March 31,   2011   2010   Increase (Decrease)              Loss ratio      91.5      76.2      15.3        Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (11.7 )    (4.3 )    (7.4 )      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (1.8 )    3.1      (4.9 )          Loss ratio, as adjusted      78.0      75.0      3.0                    Loss ratio:   The increase in the loss ratio reflects the effects of increased catastrophe losses in the first three months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 as discussed above. Also, for the three months ended March 31, 2011, Chartis U.S. recorded net adverse prior year development of $73 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $37 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts and including reserve discount charges of $25 million). During the three months ended March 31, 2010, Chartis U.S. recorded net favorable prior year loss development of $131 million (net of returned premium adjustments of $59 million relating to loss sensitive insurance contracts), primarily relating to property lines of business.   Included within 2011 adverse development for prior years of $73 million, Chartis U.S. recorded a $34 million charge for two programs relating to accident year 1999 because improvements in reporting from third party administrators resulted in additional losses being recorded. Additionally, Chartis U.S. recorded $38 million of losses relating to a reallocation of its participation in Workers' Compensation residual markets resulting from the settlement described under Litigation Related to the Matters Underlying the 2006 Regulatory Settlements — Workers' Compensation Premium Reporting in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  111      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  For the three months ended March 31, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to:    •an increase to the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Chartis U.S. Specialty Workers' Compensation and Excess Casualty business as a result of the current year loss ratios established in connection with its 2010 annual loss reserve study; and   •an increase in losses on short tail lines of business (primarily within its property lines).        Expense ratio:   The overall decline in the expense ratio is due to a 2011 reduction in certain insurance and reinsurance credit risk related allowances based on ongoing improvements relating to the analysis of certain account balances and related credit and financial statement exposure. In the first three months of 2011, Chartis U.S. reduced its bad debt allowance by approximately $44 million as compared to an increase of $24 million in the same period in 2010. In addition, expenses declined due to strategic reductions in certain direct marketing activities and other commission reductions due to declines in writings of certain classes of Consumer lines business. Further, 2011 is beginning to reflect the effects of cost saving initiatives introduced during the latter part of 2010. Partially offsetting these declines are increased personnel costs-relating to Chartis' U.S. strategy to continue to attract, retain and develop its human capital and to better align employee performance incentive programs with profitability, capital management, risk management, and other AIG performance measures.       Chartis U.S. Investing Results   Net investment income for Chartis U.S. increased primarily as a result of partnership investments returning to profitability as market conditions improved. Chartis U.S. recorded a Net realized capital gain due to sales of fixed maturity securities and equity securities as market conditions improved and lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments due to improved cash flow expectations on structured securities.

Beginning on July 1, 2010, Fuji's net premiums written were included in Chartis International. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, Fuji's net premiums written were $1.0 billion, of which $0.9 billion relates to Consumer lines and $0.1 billion relates to Commercial lines. In addition, Chartis International's Life insurance business included in Consumer lines is produced by Fuji; and   •continued stabilization of developed economies. This increased stabilization resulted in improved pricing, increased new business submissions and improved policyholder retention rates in both Consumer and Commercial lines.    From a regional perspective, growth in the Far East region was driven primarily by the Fuji acquisition. The Growth Economy countries, with well established franchises and operations, continue to increase insurance penetration and growth within Consumer and Commercial lines. The Europe region's net premium written levels were consistent with 2010 due to continued strong pricing discipline in a recovering soft market.  AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Chartis International net premiums written:                     Three Months Ended March 31,   2011 vs. 2010            Increase in original currency(a)      28.1 %(b)    Foreign exchange effect      2.5            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars      30.6 %             (a) Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.

Expense ratio:   The decline in the expense ratio is due to the acquisition of Fuji. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, Fuji reported an expense ratio of 19.8. This ratio reflects the benefits from the amortization of net intangible liabilities relating to the Fuji acquisition. Excluding Fuji, the expense ratio increased 1 point. This increase relates to costs that are consistent with management's strategic objectives, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, global accounting and claims systems initiatives and Solvency II readiness. Additionally, Chartis International incurred approximately $14 million of expenses relating to the implementation of its business continuity plans and charges related to fixed asset damage as a result of the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan.       Chartis International Investing and Other Results   Chartis International net investment income increased primarily due to the acquisition of Fuji, which contributed $78 million of net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2011.   Chartis International recorded a net realized capital loss in the first three months of 2011 compared to a net realized capital gain in 2010. The 2010 period included $164 million of gains relating to fixed maturity securities.   The bargain purchase gain of $332 million in 2010 was recognized in connection with the acquisition of Fuji.  114      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense    The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for the Chartis U.S. and Chartis International reporting units in the Chartis operating segment and loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit which is reported in AIG's Other operations category.

AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit:                         (in millions)   March 31, 2011   December 31, 2010            Chartis:                    Chartis U.S.    $ 53,581    $ 53,111        Chartis International      16,620      14,963            Total Chartis      70,201      68,074            Mortgage Guaranty      3,273      3,433            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 73,474    $ 71,507             115      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Discounting of Reserves   At March 31, 2011, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.19 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Those asbestos liabilities that are fixed and determinable are discounted based on investment yields. The discount is comprised of the following: $790 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in Chartis U.S. and $2.27 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in Chartis U.S.; and $128 million — non-tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.   Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of March 31, 2011. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of March 31, 2011. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2011 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   See Chartis Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.   As described more fully in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount and a minor adjustment to the environmental gross and net reserves are reflected in the table below.  117                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   On April 20, 2011, Chartis announced that it has entered into an agreement with NICO under which the bulk of Chartis' legacy asbestos liabilities will be transferred to NICO as part of Chartis' ongoing strategy to reduce its reserve development risk. At the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis will cede the majority of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis will pay NICO approximately $1.65 billion in respect of the cession. See Priorities for 2011 — Chartis herein and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at March 31, 2010 by approximately 0.5 years and 1.4 years, respectively.   Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves are not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.   Further, these ratios are expected to be significantly affected by the NICO asbestos reinsurance agreement commencing in the second quarter of 2011.  The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                   2011    2010      Three Months Ended March 31,   Gross   Net   Gross   Net            Survival ratios:                                Asbestos      9.0      10.0      4.5      3.9        Environmental      3.2      3.0      4.4      3.3        Combined      8.4      8.9      4.5      3.8                    SunAmerica Operations    SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups including term life, universal life, accident & health products, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct to-consumer platforms.   In managing SunAmerica, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization and goodwill impairment charges. Operating income (loss) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of Operating income (loss) enhances the understanding  119      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of SunAmerica. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the tables that follow.

These increases were partially offset by the effects of a decline in base yields as investment purchases in 2010 and early 2011 were made at yields lower than the weighted average yields of the overall base portfolio.   •The increases in net investment income were partially offset by a DAC and SIA unlocking charge of $76 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, resulting from reductions in spread assumptions for group retirement products. There were no unlockings in the three months ended March 31, 2010.    Pre-tax income for SunAmerica reflected a decline in net realized capital losses due principally to a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairments and a decrease in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves. See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).   Premiums   Premiums represent premiums received on traditional life insurance policies and deposits on life contingent payout annuities. Premiums, deposits and other considerations is a non-GAAP measure which includes life insurance premiums, deposits on annuity contracts and mutual funds.

Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing customers. Sales of group accident and health insurance represent annualized first-year premiums from new policies.  121      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Total premiums, deposits and other considerations increased as deposits from individual fixed annuities, individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds all showed significant increases. The decline in Life insurance was primarily driven by lower payout annuities, lower deferred annuities driven by the interest rate environment and lower life insurance renewals. Individual fixed annuity deposits increased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 as certain bank distributors negotiated a lower commission in exchange for a higher rate offered to policyholders which made AIG's individual fixed products more attractive. Variable annuity sales increased due to reinstatements at a number of key broker-dealers, increased wholesaler productivity and improvements in the equity markets. Retail mutual funds increased as a result of increased sales due to a sales strategy surrounding cyclical investment themes. Life insurance sales grew over the first quarter of last year as efforts to re-engage independent distribution and improve productivity of the career agency force continue to produce results.  122      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Domestic Retirement Services Sales and Deposits  The following table presents the account value rollforward for Domestic Retirement Services:                         Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011   2010            Group retirement products                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 68,365    $ 63,419        Deposits – annuities      1,291      1,254        Deposits – mutual funds      411      354              Total Deposits      1,702      1,608        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (1,503 )    (1,676 )      Death benefits      (83 )    (73 )            Net inflows (outflows)      116      (141 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      2,084      1,591            Balance, end of period    $ 70,565    $ 64,869            Individual fixed annuities                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 48,489    $ 47,202        Deposits      2,151      1,153        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (840 )    (905 )      Death benefits      (402 )    (370 )            Net inflows (outflows)      909      (122 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      456      467            Balance, end of period    $ 49,854    $ 47,547            Individual variable annuities                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 25,581    $ 24,637        Deposits      759      357        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (838 )    (674 )      Death benefits      (110 )    (120 )            Net outflows      (189 )    (437 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      885      666            Balance, end of period    $ 26,277    $ 24,866            Total Domestic Retirement Services                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 142,435    $ 135,258        Deposits      4,612      3,118        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (3,181 )    (3,255 )      Death benefits      (595 )    (563 )            Net inflows (outflows)      836      (700 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      3,425      2,724              Balance, end of period, excluding runoff      146,696      137,282        Individual annuities runoff      4,386      4,579        GIC runoff      7,823      8,427            Balance, end of period    $ 158,905    $ 150,288            General and separate account reserves and mutual funds                    General account reserve    $ 98,505    $ 95,400        Separate account reserve      50,776      46,639            Total general and separate account reserves      149,281      142,039        Group retirement mutual funds      9,624      8,249            Total reserves and mutual funds    $ 158,905    $ 150,288             123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Net flows improved in 2011 due to the impact of both the significant increase in deposits and continued favorable surrender experience in group retirement and individual fixed annuities. Surrender rates for individual fixed annuities have decreased in 2011 due to the low interest rate environment and the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. Surrender rates for group retirement products declined due to a decrease in certain large group surrenders.

The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, SunAmerica's DAC and VOBA may be subject to an impairment charge and its results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.       Financial Services Operations    AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage primarily in commercial aircraft leasing and the management of the remaining Capital Markets derivatives business.   AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.  124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIG's Capital Markets operations are the run off of the remaining AIGFP derivative portfolios. AIGFP has continued to unwind its portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities. As a consequence of its strategy to wind down its portfolios, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with the businesses of other AIG subsidiaries. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — Capital Markets. Prior to the portfolio wind-down, AIGFP engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates.   Historically, AIGFP derived a significant portion of its revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. Prior to the portfolio wind-down, AIGFP also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions.       Financial Services Results        Financial Services results were as follows:                              Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011   2010   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Revenues:                          Aircraft Leasing    $ 1,159    $ 1,218      (5 )%      Capital Markets      370      (22 )    -        Other, including intercompany adjustments      39      94      (59 )          Total    $ 1,568    $ 1,290      22 %          Pre-tax income (loss):                          Aircraft Leasing    $ 120    $ (81 )    - %      Capital Markets      277      (86 )    -        Other, including intercompany adjustments      (72 )    (35 )    (106 )          Total    $ 325    $ (202 )    - %            Aircraft Leasing Results   ILFC reported pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period of 2010 primarily due to lower asset impairment and operating lease related charges recorded on aircraft. During the first quarter of 2011, ILFC recorded asset impairment and operating lease related charges of $113 million related primarily to sales and potential sales of 10 aircraft. In the same quarter in 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment and operating lease related charges of $431 million related to aircraft agreed to be sold. ILFC also incurred increased interest expense driven by higher composite borrowing rates, and lower rental revenues and depreciation expense as a result of a reduction in its aircraft fleet.   Capital Markets Results   Capital Markets reported pre-tax income in 2011 compared to a pre-tax loss in 2010 primarily due to higher unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio and an increase related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities. During the first quarter of 2011, Capital Markets recorded an unrealized market valuation gain of $323 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $119 million in the first quarter of 2010. The gain resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price improvement and amortization of the underlying assets (See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio). With respect to the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value, Capital Markets incurred a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $28 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $178 million in the first quarter of 2010.  125                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Other Operations    AIG's Other operations includes results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, Mortgage Guaranty operations, Asset Management operations, and results from those divested businesses not included in Discontinued operations.   AIG's Parent & Other operations consist primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate-level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses which did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment. In addition, fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA and in the MetLife securities received as consideration from the sale of ALICO are included in Parent & Other.   Divested businesses include results of certain businesses that have been divested or are being wound down or repositioned.

Parent & Other   Parent & Other reported an increased pre-tax loss in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in connection with the Recapitalization, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility.  126      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  This loss was partially offset by:   •a $1.1 billion increase in fair value of AIG's equity interest in AIA;   •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and   •a reduction in unallocated corporate expenses, principally due to a decrease in restructuring-related expenses.   Other Businesses   Mortgage Guaranty   The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to four-family residences.   Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax income decreased in 2011, driven by:   •increases in earned premiums from first-lien business that were more than offset by a decline in earned premiums from the second-lien, private student loan and international businesses resulting from these businesses being placed into runoff during the fourth quarter of 2008; and   •an increase in claims and claims adjustment expenses for the first-lien and second-lien businesses compared to the first quarter of 2010, partially offset by a decline for the international business. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses include provisions for increased overturns of previously denied and rescinded claims and lower favorable development than experienced in the same period in 2010, all primarily in first-lien business. The increased overturns result from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses were partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products and higher denials and rescissions on first-lien claims and an increase in denials of second-lien claims arising from an operational change in the mitigation of second lien claims in the first quarter of 2011.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties. These claims and counterclaims allege breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud, among other allegations.       Risk-in-Force  The following table presents risk in force and delinquency ratio information for UGC's domestic business:                         At March 31, (dollars in billions)   2011   2010            Domestic first-lien:                    Risk in force    $ 24.9    $ 26.1        60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a)      15.2 %    18.7 %    Domestic second-lien:                    Risk in force(b)    $ 1.8    $ 2.5               (a) Based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice. (b)Represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions, which will expire as the loan balances are repaid.  127      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     Change in Fair Value of ML III   The gain attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to the shortening of weighted average life by 0.55 years and the tightening of credit spreads.   Asset Management Operations   AIG's Asset Management operations include the results of the Direct Investment businesses and the Institutional Asset Management business.   The revenues of the Institutional Asset Management business are primarily derived from providing asset management services to AIG and its subsidiaries and are eliminated in AIG's consolidated financial results. The Direct Investment businesses' operating results are impacted by performance in the credit, equity and real estate markets.       Direct Investment Business Results   The Direct Investment business includes results for the Matched Investment Program (MIP), AIG Global Real Estate and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP now managed by the Asset Management Group.   The Direct Investment business' pre-tax income increased in 2011 driven by:   •net unrealized gain on AIGFP assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option where improving asset spreads outpaced the impact of tightening liability spreads (as shown in the table below); and   •significantly lower impairments on fixed maturity and real estate investments.  The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the Direct Investment business (excluding intercompany transactions):                          (in millions)                       Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       Three Months Ended March 31, 2011                      Bond trading securities    $ 325    Notes and bonds payable    $ (18 )    Loans and other assets      16    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      (30 )              GIAs      9                Other liabilities      (2 )              Increase in assets    $ 341    Increase in liabilities    $ (41 )              Net pre-tax increase to Other income    $ 300                      Three Months Ended March 31, 2010                      Bond trading securities   $ 823    Notes and bonds payable   $ (196 )    Loans and other assets     46    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     (249 )              GIAs     (145 )              Other liabilities     (37 )              Increase in assets   $ 869    Increase in liabilities   $ (627 )              Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 242                       128      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries         Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management includes AIG's internal asset management business and AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets). AIG Markets acts as a derivative intermediary transacting with AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties.   Institutional Asset Management recognized pre-tax income in 2011 which was driven by increased fees charged to AIG subsidiaries for asset management services beginning in the first quarter of 2011 as well as fair value adjustments on derivatives associated with changes in counterparty credit risk. The positive increase over the prior year is driven by the sale of AIG's third party asset management business and the deconsolidation of certain private equity investments in the first quarter of 2010 which significantly reduced operating expenses.   Divested Businesses   Divested businesses include the operating results of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting through the date of their sale as well as certain non-core businesses currently in run-off. The Divested businesses results for the three months ended March 31, 2010 primarily represent the historical results of AIA, which was deconsolidated in November 2010.       Capital Resources and Liquidity       Overview   As a result of the closing of the Recapitalization and various actions taken in the first quarter of 2011, AIG Parent has generated and used substantial cash and short-term investment balances, and has established significant sources of contingent liquidity.       Liquidity Adequacy Management    In 2010, AIG implemented a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess AIG's aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIG's existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two-year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks.   AIG's insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERM's stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation in order to determine AIG Parent's liquidity needs to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required under stressed scenarios for non-insurance operations, including the AIGFP derivatives portfolio, the Direct Investment business and ILFC.   AIG's consolidated risk target is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer such that AIG Parent's liquidity needs under the ERM stress scenarios do not exceed 80 percent of AIG Parent's overall liquidity sources over the specified two-year horizon. If the 80 percent minimum threshold is projected to be breached over this defined time horizon, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources or reduce liquidity needs to maintain the target threshold, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions.   As a result of these ERM stress tests at March 31, 2011 and other considerations discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. However, no assurance can be given that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may  129      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   During the first quarter of 2011, AIG entered into unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain domestic Chartis and SAFG insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Chartis, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — SunAmerica below.       Analysis of sources and uses of cash   The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                         Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2011   2010            Summary:                    Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities    $ (5,312 )  $ 3,195        Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities      39,617      (4,516 )      Net cash used in financing activities      (34,485 )    (266 )      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      23      (42 )          Decrease in cash      (157 )    (1,629 )    Cash at beginning of year      1,558      4,400      Change in cash of businesses held for sale      400      (638 )          Cash at end of period    $ 1,801    $ 2,133              Net cash used in operating activities for the first three months of 2011 reflects the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued compounded interest and fees totaling $6.4 billion, which in prior periods were paid in kind and, accordingly did not reduce operating cash flow in prior periods.   Excluding the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued interest and fees, AIG generated positive operating cash flows in both periods. Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits, but the ability of Chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by operating expenses, the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies and policy retention rates. Cash used by Chartis operations was $228 million for the first three months of 2011 compared to $421 million in the same period of 2010, as a reduction in claims paid was more than offset by declines in premiums collected, arising primarily from a decrease in domestic production. Catastrophic events and significant casualty losses, the timing and effect of which are inherently unpredictable, reduce operating cash flow for Chartis operations. Cash provided by AIG's life insurance subsidiaries, including entities presented as discontinued operations, was $1.4 billion for the first three months of 2011 compared to $2.7 billion in the same period in 2010, as 2010 included operating cash flows for AIA and ALICO, which were divested in 2010. Cash used by Financial Services was $136 million for the first three months of 2011, compared to cash provided of $588 million for the same period in 2010, primarily attributable to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolio.   The AIGFP portfolio wind-down and other segment developments affecting pre-tax income (loss) described above are discussed further in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — Capital Markets.   The significant increase in cash from investing activities in the first three months of 2011 was driven by the deployment of restricted cash generated from the AIA IPO and ALICO Sale and disposition of MetLife securities. Net cash used in investing activities in the first three months of 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities, resulting from AIG's investment of cash generated from operating activities, and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in 2008 and 2009.   Net cash used in financing activities for the first three months of 2011 primarily represents the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $9.1 billion partial repayment of the SPV Preferred Interests on January 14, 2011 in connection with the Recapitalization described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  130                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries    AIG Parent   The Recapitalization in January 2011 involved a series of integrated transactions which directly impacted AIG Parent's liquidity activities and position. These transactions included the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the repurchase and exchange of the SPV Preferred Interests. These transactions are excluded from the Sources and Uses discussion below.   In addition, in the first quarter of 2011, several significant asset sales were completed, including the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison in February 2011, and the sale of MetLife securities in March 2011. These transactions are more fully described in Sales of Businesses and Sales of MetLife Securities above, and are excluded from the Sources and Uses discussion below.   Sources of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary sources of cash flow are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. In the first three months of 2011, AIG Parent collected $32 million in payments from subsidiaries.   As a result of the closing of the Recapitalization, AIG has established and maintains substantial sources of actual and contingent liquidity.  The following table presents AIG Parent's sources of liquidity, other than liquidity that is expected to result from cash flows from operations:                     (in millions)   As of March 31, 2011            Cash*   $ 42      Short-term investments*     6,685      Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities     3,000      Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facility     500      Available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment (Series G)     2,000            Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $ 12,227               * Excludes Cash and Short-term Investments held by AIGFP (excluding Banque AIG S.A.) which are considered to be unrestricted and available for use by AIG Parent; these balances totaled $326 million at March 31, 2011.   AIG's ability to borrow under the syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings. For further discussion of the terms and conditions relating to the bank credit facilities, see Credit Facilities below. For additional information on the contingent liquidity facility, see Debt below. The available funding under the Series G Drawdown Right that may be used for general corporate purposes will be reduced by the amount of the net proceeds of future AIG equity offerings.   Uses of Liquidity   AIG's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In the first three months of 2011, AIG Parent retired $1.4 billion of debt and made interest payments totaling $483 million. As noted above, approximately $5.0 billion of AIG Parent's cash and short-term investment balances represents balances attributable to the MIP and available to meet obligations of the MIP. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Other Operations — Asset Management — Direct Investment Business below for additional details.   AIG Parent made $3.8 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2011, of which $3.7 billion was contributed to Chartis as a result of the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. This transaction was funded from the retention of $2 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of AIG Star and AIG  131      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Edison (which the Department of the Treasury provided a waiver for AIG to use for this purpose instead of using the amount to repay SPV Preferred Interests) and available cash at AIG Parent.   AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.   Several Chartis U.S. insurance subsidiaries have deferred tax assets on a separate company basis, including those resulting from net operating losses incurred. In the event that the deferred tax assets become non-admitted for insurance regulatory reporting purposes, Chartis may require additional capital contributions from AIG. Based on the December 31, 2010 statutory balances, which are the latest available, such contributions could be as much as $2.3 billion. For additional information, see Chartis liquidity overview below.   Chartis   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Chartis subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $14.8 billion as of March 31, 2011. Further, Chartis businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which Chartis could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient. In the first quarter of 2011, Chartis received a capital contribution of $3.7 billion in cash from AIG as a result of the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. Chartis used $1.8 billion of this amount to purchase certain assets from the Direct Investment Business (DIB). Additionally, Chartis subsequently returned capital to AIG Parent of $2.2 billion in the form of all of the outstanding stock of UGC in the first quarter of 2011.   One or more large catastrophes may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected Chartis operations. In addition, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the relevant subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations, and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of Chartis subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Chartis operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.   In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined under applicable insurance laws). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs (as reflected in the companies' quarterly or annual statutory financial statements), subject to board and regulatory approval(s), the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage.   Several Chartis U.S. insurance subsidiaries have deferred tax assets on a separate company basis, including those resulting from net operating losses incurred. Chartis intends to rely on prudent and feasible effective tax planning actions and/or strategies to preserve admissibility of such deferred tax assets for insurance regulatory reporting (statutory) purposes. In the event that Chartis cannot execute such actions, if required, and the related deferred tax assets become non-admitted for insurance regulatory reporting purposes, such insurance companies would require additional capital contributions of up to $2.3 billion from AIG, based on December 31, 2010 statutory balances, which are the latest available. The Chartis U.S. deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance at the AIG consolidated level as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  132      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Chartis continues to identify cost effective opportunities to manage its capital allocation through the use of intercompany reinsurance.   SunAmerica   Management considers the sources of liquidity for SunAmerica subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet foreseeable liquidity needs, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. The SunAmerica companies continue to maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $13.1 billion as of March 31, 2011. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed income securities in order to reduce the levels of cash, cash equivalents and other short-term instruments that had been maintained during 2009 and 2010.   The most significant potential liquidity needs of SunAmerica companies are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of SunAmerica's investment portfolios, AIG believes that any deviations from projected claim experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk.   In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain SunAmerica insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected company action level RBCs (as defined under applicable insurance laws). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs (as reflected in the companies' quarterly or annual statutory financial statements), subject to board and regulatory approval(s), the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage.   Financial Services   AIG's major Financial Services operations consist of ILFC and the remaining portfolios of AIGFP, which are in wind-down.   International Lease Finance Corporation   ILFC's sources of liquidity include collections of lease payments, borrowing in the public markets, and proceeds from asset sales. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments. In 2011, ILFC improved its liquidity position by entering into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility and a secured $1.3 billion term loan with the right to add an additional $200 million of lender commitments. On April 21, 2011, ILFC increased its secured $1.3 billion term loan for a total commitment of $1.5 billion. ILFC also sold nine aircraft to third parties in the first three months of 2011, which generated $199 million in gross proceeds.   See Debt — Debt Maturities — ILFC for further details on ILFC's outstanding debt.   Capital Markets   Due to the wind-down of AIGFP's remaining portfolios, AIGFP continues to rely upon AIG Parent to meet most of its collateral and other liquidity needs.  133      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by the Capital Markets operations:                              (in millions)   Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2010   Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty   Collateral Returned by Counterparties   Collateral Posted as of March 31, 2011            Super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio    $ 3,786    $ 195    $ 594    $ 3,387      All other derivatives      1,335      298      212      1,421            Total    $ 5,121    $ 493    $ 806    $ 4,808              During 2010, AIG's Asset Management Group undertook the management responsibilities for certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. These assets and liabilities are being managed on a spread basis, in concert with the MIP. Accordingly, gains and losses related to these assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of credit valuation adjustment gains and losses, are reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Asset Management — Direct Investment business. For additional details regarding liquidity considerations related to these assets and liabilities, see Other Operations below.

(b) Excludes approximately 4,800 non-derivative trade positions that were transferred to Direct Investment business in 2010.   AIG expects the active unwind of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011, and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio will consist predominantly of transactions AIG believes will be of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.   The cost and liquidity needs of executing the AIGFP portfolio wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.   Other Operations   Asset Management — Direct Investment Business   The DIB includes results for the MIP, AIG Global Real Estate and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP now managed by the Asset Management Group. AIG's Existing CDS contracts for the MIP under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements may require collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels. Approximately $5.0 billion of AIG, Inc.'s cash and short-term investment balances included in the summary table in AIG Parent — Sources of Liquidity represents balances attributable to the MIP.   While a significant portion of the DIB's liquidity needs are supported by existing liquidity sources or maturing investments, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows may require assets to be sold to satisfy liquidity needs. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets if required, proceeds from asset sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount required. Management believes that sufficient liquidity is maintained by the DIB to meet near-term liquidity needs. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be  134      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  funded by AIG Parent. The amount of collateral posted by the DIB for collateralized GIAs as of March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $5.4 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.   During the first quarter of 2011, $1.8 billion of assets held by the DIB were sold to certain Chartis U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, AIG assigned approximately 52 percent of AIG's interest in Maiden Lane III to the DIB, subject to liens on those interests as set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement dated December 8, 2010, among AIG Parent, AM Holdings LLC (formerly known as ALICO Holdings LLC), AIA Aurora LLC, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury, and the Trust.       Debt    Debt Maturities  The following table summarizes maturing debt at March 31, 2011 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                 (in millions)   Second Quarter 2011   Third Quarter 2011   Fourth Quarter 2011   First Quarter 2012   Total            ILFC   $ 1,262   $ 2,232   $ 336   $ 1,998   $ 5,828      Borrowings supported by assets     1,794     1,342     1,163     1,369     5,668      General borrowings     -     -     604     -     604      Other     1     1     1     1     4            Total   $ 3,057   $ 3,575   $ 2,104   $ 3,368   $ 12,104              AIG's plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows:    •ILFC's sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions, (see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC). In March 2011, ILFC entered into a secured $1.3 billion term loan with the right to add an additional $200 million of lender commitments. On April 21, 2011, ILFC increased its secured $1.3 billion term loan for a total commitment of $1.5 billion. During 2011, ILFC sold nine aircraft to third parties, which generated $199 million in gross proceeds. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations.   •AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt being managed in the DIB. Approximately $5.1 billion of $5.7 billion of debt maturities in the DIB through March 31, 2012 are supported by maturities of investments and short term cash investments. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.   135      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table provides the rollforward of AIG's total debt outstanding:                                      Three Months Ended March 31, 2011 (in millions)   Balance at December 31, 2010   Issuances   Maturities and Repayments   Effect of Foreign Exchange   Other Changes   Balance at March 31, 2011            Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                          General borrowings:                                            FRBNY Credit Facility    $ 20,985    $ -    $ (20,985 )(a)  $ -    $ -    $ -        Notes and bonds payable      11,511      -      -      72      -      11,583        Junior subordinated debt      11,740      -      -      227      -      11,967        Junior subordinated debt attributable to equity units      2,169      -      (1,446 )(b)    -      -      723        Loans and mortgages payable      218      -      (143 )    (3 )    1      73        SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc.

Credit Facilities   AIG relies on credit facilities as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Currently, AIG, Chartis and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities and a letter of credit facility summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes. AIG and Chartis intend to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. One of the facilities, as noted below, contains a "term-out option" allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. All facilities, except for the ILFC five-year syndicated credit facility maturing October 2012, are unsecured.

AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, including covenants relating to AIG's maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict AIG's access to the facilities and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIG's financial condition and results of operations.   The Chartis letter of credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit in favor of certain of its general insurance companies to permit those companies to obtain statutory recognition of reinsurance recoverables from unauthorized reinsurers. This facility requires Chartis to maintain a minimum combined statutory surplus and a minimum combined net worth, and contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to incurrence of certain types of indebtedness or liens, certain dispositions, entry into certain restrictive agreements and transactions with affiliates and certain fundamental changes, as well as customary events of default. At March 31, 2011, the Chartis letter of credit facility was fully drawn and no additional amounts are available under this facility.   ILFC's three-year credit facility which became effective January 31, 2011 contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that require ILFC to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a maximum ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth. Prior to April 16, 2010, ILFC had a $2.5 billion five-year syndicated facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. On April 16, 2010, ILFC extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. In December 2010, ILFC paid down $800 million on the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The amended facility prohibits ILFC from re-borrowing amounts repaid under this facility for any reason; therefore the size of the outstanding facility is $1.7 billion.   Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of April 29, 2011. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(c) Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.  (d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.  138      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of the GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings or, with the consent of the counterparties, assignment or repayment of the positions or arrangement of a substitute guarantee of AIG's obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

(b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $5.3 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of Capital Markets credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At March 31, 2011, the fair value derivative liability was $3.1 billion, relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at March 31, 2011 AIGFP had posted collateral of $2.6 billion with respect to these swaps.  139                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   The following table summarizes Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                             Amount of Commitment Expiration      March 31, 2011 (in millions)   Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2011   2012 - 2013   2014 - 2015   2016   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 695   $ -   $ 594   $ -   $ -   $ 101        Standby letters of credit     989     963     14     11     -     1        Guarantees of indebtedness     212     -     -     -     -     212        All other guarantees(b)(c)     636     63     217     187     53     116      Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(d)     3,360     2,137     893     250     64     16        Commitments to extend credit     319     245     49     24     -     1        Letters of credit     1,552     1,470     82     -     -     -        Other commercial commitments(e)     720     19     -     -     -     701            Total(f)   $ 8,483   $ 4,897   $ 1,849   $ 472   $ 117   $ 1,148               (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (b)Includes SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. (c)Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnifications included in asset sales agreements. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d)Includes commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in limited partnerships and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (e)Includes options to acquire aircraft. Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2011 is expected to be approximately $68 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (f)Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.       Securities Financing    The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.       Dividend Restrictions    See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends.       Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities    While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  140      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Investments       Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment business. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the Direct Investment business, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Chartis U.S. historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the current risk/return and tax objectives of Chartis U.S., the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by Chartis International companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At March 31, 2011, approximately 88 percent of the fixed maturity securities were held by domestic entities. Approximately 24 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 11 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2011, approximately 25 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 4 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 37 percent of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG's fixed maturity investments based on fair value:                             March 31, 2011   December 31, 2010            Rating:                    AAA      25 %    24 %      AA      21      22        A      21      21        BBB      23      22        Below investment grade      7      7        Non-rated      3      4            Total      100 %    100 %                  Investments by Segment  The following tables summarize the composition of AIG's investments by reportable segment:                                  (in millions)   Chartis   SunAmerica   Financial Services   Other   Total            March 31, 2011                                    Fixed maturity securities:                                      Bonds available for sale, at fair value    $ 92,620   $ 139,530   $ 105   $ 6,060   $ 238,315        Bond trading securities, at fair value      -     1,584     58     25,667     27,309      Equity securities:                                      Common and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value      2,989     213     1     670     3,873        Common and preferred stock trading, at fair value      -     1     155     7     163      Mortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance      642     16,603     697     1,749     19,691      Flight equipment primarily under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation      -     -     38,100     -     38,100      Other invested assets      13,182     13,462     142     16,114     42,900      Short-term investments      14,083     12,771     2,666     9,352     38,872            Total investments(a)      123,516     184,164     41,924     59,619     409,223      Cash      726     327     544     204     1,801            Total invested assets(b)    $ 124,242   $ 184,491   $ 42,468   $ 59,823   $ 411,024            December 31, 2010                                    Fixed maturity securities:                                      Bonds available for sale, at fair value   $ 88,904   $ 128,347   $ 108   $ 10,943   $ 228,302        Bond trading securities, at fair value     -     1,307     339     24,536     26,182      Equity securities:                                      Common and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value     3,827     218     2     534     4,581        Common and preferred stock trading, at fair value     -     1     152     6,499     6,652      Mortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance     690     16,727     742     2,078     20,237      Flight equipment primarily under operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation     -     -     38,510     -     38,510      Other invested assets     13,743     13,069     270     15,128     42,210      Short-term investments     11,799     19,160     3,878     8,901     43,738            Total investments(a)     118,963     178,829     44,001     68,619     410,412      Cash     572     270     302     414     1,558            Total invested assets   $ 119,535   $ 179,099   $ 44,303   $ 69,033   $ 411,970               (a) At March 31, 2011, approximately 87 percent and 13 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities, respectively, compared to approximately 85 percent and 15 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2010.

Although the market value of the holdings has improved and CMBS spreads have tightened during the first quarter of 2011, it continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings.

Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.   AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 related to:   •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments and private equity investments.   With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.03 percent and 0.10 percent of Total equity in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $103 million and $92 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For a discussion of AIG's other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  152      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries An aging of the pre-tax unrealized losses of fixed maturity and equity securities, distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the fair value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of respective items was as follows:                                                       March 31, 2011     Less Than or Equal to 20% of Cost(b)     Greater Than 20% to 50% of Cost(b)     Greater Than 50% of Cost(b)     Total             Aging(a) (dollars in millions)   Cost(c)   Unrealized Loss   Items(e)   Cost(c)   Unrealized Loss   Items(e)   Cost(c)   Unrealized Loss   Items(e)   Cost(c)   Unrealized Loss(d)   Items(e)             Investment grade bonds                                                                                0-6 months   $ 42,534   $ 951     4,134   $ 106   $ 33     13   $ 5   $ 1     4   $ 42,645   $ 985     4,151        7-12 months     2,768     120     318     32     10     6     141     74     4     2,941     204     328        > 12 months     11,530     773     1,346     1,979     562     229     173     110     52     13,682     1,445     1,627            Total    $ 56,832   $ 1,844     5,798   $ 2,117   $ 605     248   $ 319   $ 185     60   $ 59,268   $ 2,634     6,106            Below investment grade bonds                                                                                0-6 months   $ 1,468   $ 51     278   $ 240   $ 60     22   $ 32   $ 23     27   $ 1,740   $ 134     327        7-12 months     216     10     20     54     17     6     -     -     11     270     27     37        > 12 months     3,760     271     380     1,954     577     206     199     130     65     5,913     978     651            Total    $ 5,444   $ 332     678   $ 2,248   $ 654     234   $ 231   $ 153     103   $ 7,923   $ 1,139     1,015            Total bonds                                                                                0-6 months   $ 44,002   $ 1,002     4,412   $ 346   $ 93     35   $ 37   $ 24     31   $ 44,385   $ 1,119     4,478        7-12 months     2,984     130     338     86     27     12     141     74     15     3,211     231     365        > 12 months     15,290     1,044     1,726     3,933     1,139     435     372     240     117     19,595     2,423     2,278            Total(e)    $ 62,276   $ 2,176     6,476   $ 4,365   $ 1,259     482   $ 550   $ 338     163   $ 67,191   $ 3,773     7,121            Equity securities                                                                                0-6 months   $ 162   $ 9     71   $ 4   $ 1     9   $ -   $ -     -   $ 166   $ 10     80        7-12 months     173     15     21     12     4     10     -     -     -     185     19     31        > 12 months     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -            Total    $ 335   $ 24     92   $ 16   $ 5     19   $ -   $ -     -   $ 351   $ 29     111                                                                                              (a) Represents the number of consecutive months that fair value has been less than cost by any amount.  (b) Represents the percentage by which fair value is less than cost at March 31, 2011.  (c) For bonds, represents amortized cost.  (d) The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC.  (e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.    For the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $1.0 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of March 31, 2011, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for more than 12 months consisted of the unrealized loss of $240 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 52 securities with an amortized cost of $173 million and a net unrealized loss of $110 million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate-related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive.  153                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.   See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of AIG's investment portfolio.       Enterprise Risk Management    For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Credit Risk Management   AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark-to-market), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties and letters of credit (in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity:                         March 31, 2011  Category   Risk Rating(a)   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity(b)            Investment Grade:                    10 largest combined(c)     A +    100.8 %      Single largest financial institution     AA -   6.8        Single largest corporate     AAA     3.9        Single largest sovereign     AAA     34.8      Non-Investment Grade:                    10 largest combined     BB     4.8        Single largest financial institution     BB -   0.6        Single largest corporate     BB     0.7        Single largest sovereign     BB +   0.6               (a) Reflects AIG's internal risk ratings.  (b) Amounts shown include Nan Shan which was held for sale at March 31, 2011.  (c) Six of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions, three are to investment-grade rated sovereigns and one is to an AAA-rated corporate. Based on support from the U.S. Government, the exposure to government-sponsored entities (GSEs) and to mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the GSEs is included in the U.S. Government total, rather than in financial institutions. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB or its equivalent.   AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties, its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries and operating aircraft leases. Eight countries have cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2011. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, as of March 31, 2011, six countries were rated AAA, one was rated AA, and one was rated A. The two largest cross-border exposures are to the United Kingdom and France.  154      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG's single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms and insurance and reinsurance companies. These exposures include fixed income securities, operating account balances, deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, the mark-to-market and potential future exposure to derivative exposures, collateral placed with counterparties, letters of credit received as collateral to insurance programs and credit exposure to captive insurance programs.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity:                      March 31, 2011     Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity*            Industry Category:              Money center/Global bank groups      67.8 %      Global reinsurance companies     14.6        European regional financial institutions     14.4        Global life insurance companies     12.1        Global non-life insurance companies     7.8        North American based regional financial institutions     7.5               * Amounts shown include Nan Shan which was held for sale at March 31, 2011.   AIG's exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 26.8 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2011 compared to 21.4 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2010, reflecting the effect of the Recapitalization on total equity.   AIG also has a risk concentration through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG holds approximately $42.9 billion (amortized cost) of tax-exempt and taxable securities, $5.9 billion of which are pre-refunded, issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories. A majority of these securities are held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property-casualty insurance companies. These securities are comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The weighted average credit quality of these issuers is A. AIG has $906 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios.   Currently, several states, local governments and other issuers are facing pressures on their budgets from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending, raise taxes and fees and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG's portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the major nationally recognized statistical rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers is the State of California, of which AIG holds approximately $653 million of general obligation bonds, $45 million of which are pre-refunded, and the State of Illinois, of which AIG holds approximately $221 million, $69 million of which are pre-refunded.   AIG has credit exposure to several European sovereign governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in recent months by one or more major rating agencies. The downgrades primarily reflect the large government budget deficits and rising government debt to GDP ratios of these countries. As of March 31, 2011, AIG's exposure to the governments of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Hungary amounted to $860 million. AIG has no direct sovereign exposure to Greece. Four of the aforementioned six governments have experienced rating downgrades during the first quarter of 2011.   See also Investments herein for further information.  155      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. The CRC periodically adjusts limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.       Market Risk Management       Insurance and Financial Services (excluding Capital Markets) Sensitivities   The following table provides estimates of AIG's sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                    Exposure        Effect      (dollars in millions)   March 31, 2011   December 31, 2010   Sensitivity Factor   March 31, 2011   December 31, 2010            Yield sensitive assets(a)    $ 370,300    $ 403,500    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves    $ (18,300 )  $ (19,700 )    Equity and alternative investments exposure(b)    $ 44,600    $ 54,300    20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments    $ (8,900 )  $ (10,861 )    Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure(c)    $ 5,000    $ 6,200    10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar    $ (500 )  $ (620 )             (a) Excluding Nan Shan, which is held for sale, at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Yield sensitive assets were $317.8 billion and $350.7 billion, respectively. (b)Excluding Nan Shan, which is held for sale, at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Equity and Alternative Investments were $40.7 billion to $50.6 billion, respectively. (c)Excluding Nan Shan, which is held for sale, at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Total foreign exchange exposures were $4.2 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.   Exposures for yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short-term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures for equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIG's consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis, net of Nan Shan DAC adjustment.   •Total yield sensitive assets decreased 8 percent or $33.2 billion at March 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to the divestiture of AIG Star/Edison in the first quarter of 2011 ($41.7 billion) as well as a decline in cash and other assets of $7 billion. This decline was partially offset by increases in fixed income assets of $15.4 billion.   •Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 18 percent or $9.7 billion compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to: AIG's sale of MetLife equity securities ($6.5 billion); lower common and preferred stock holdings in Japan ($1.5 billion) due to the sale of AIG Star/Edison; and decrease in mutual fund value ($0.9 billion) and real estate investment ($0.9 billion). The decrease was partially offset by the appreciation of AIA stock ($1.1 billion).   •The $1.2 billion decrease in foreign currency exchange rates net exposure is primarily due to the divestiture of AIG Star/Edison ($2.4 billion), partly offset by increases in AIG's continuing insurance operations (up $0.8 billion) and in Nan Shan (up $0.4 billion).  156      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors are the same as those used in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Critical Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:   •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;   •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and flight equipment;   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;   •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments;   •liabilities for legal contingencies;   •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of deferred tax assets; and   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps (CDS) and AIG's economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III.   These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. Following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2011. For a complete discussion of AIG's accounting estimates, see AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs — Short Duration (general insurance):   •Recoverability: based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.   Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses and maintenance cost, unamortized DAC and anticipated maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Investment income is not anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. Increases in the expected claims, and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded unearned premiums of its Chartis U.S. and Chartis International operating segments exceeded the sum of these costs at March 31, 2011, by one percent and 19 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the DAC of these reporting units was considered to be recoverable. DAC for Chartis U.S. and Chartis International amounted to $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2011.  157      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview   The following table presents the fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination:                        March 31, 2011 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 242      90 %    Fair value based on internal sources     28     10            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)   $ 270      100 %             (a) Includes $22.6 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.    See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.       Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability.   At March 31, 2011, AIG classified $37.0 billion and $5.8 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 6.0 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at March 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, AIG classified $36.3 billion and $6.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 5.3 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.   Capital Markets Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  158      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class:                                                 Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at                  Net Notional Amount    Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss) Three Months Ended March 31,          March 31, 2011(a)   December 31, 2010(a)   March 31, 2011(b)(c)   December 31, 2010(b)(c)     (in millions)   2011(c)   2010(c)            Regulatory Capital:                                            Corporate loans    $ 3,395    $ 5,193    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -        Prime residential mortgages      30,514      31,613      (196 )    (190 )    6      33        Other      1,211      1,263      8      17      9      6              Total      35,120      38,069      (188 )    (173 )    15      39            Arbitrage:                                            Multi-sector CDOs(d)      6,158      6,689      3,076      3,484      273      158        Corporate debt/CLOs(e)      12,674      12,269      134      171      37      (7 )            Total      18,832      18,958      3,210      3,655      310      151            Mezzanine tranches(f)      2,705      2,823      200      198      (2 )    (71 )          Total    $ 56,657    $ 59,850    $ 3,222    $ 3,680    $ 323    $ 119               (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

(d)During 2011, AIGFP liquidated one multi-sector super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $188 million. The primary underlying collateral components, which consisted of individual ABS CDS transactions, were sold in an auction to counterparties, including AIGFP, at their approximate fair value at the time of the liquidation. AIGFP was the winning bidder on approximately $107 million of individual ABS CDS transactions, which are reported in written single name credit default swaps as of March 31, 2011. As a result, a $121 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During 2011, AIGFP also paid $14 million to its counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, a $14 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized.

AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of March 31, 2011, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 3.40 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by  160      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties was generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio increased as of March 31, 2011 by approximately 0.2 years from December 31, 2010 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of $3.8 billion. Where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the relevant rules under Basel I will remain effective. Where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early, AIGFP has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under Basel I rules and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions.   Included in the Regulatory Capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its Prime Residential Mortgage transactions with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010. With respect to these transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay AIG fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity. Since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities, there is value to AIGFP representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through to the final contractual maturity date. The fair value of these two super senior transactions as of March 31, 2011 was a derivative asset of $196 million. With respect to these two transactions, AIGFP has also written CDS transactions on the mezzanine tranches of these portfolios; however, the majority of the transactions on the mezzanine tranches were hedged by AIGFP with other third-party CDS transactions. In October 2008, following a credit ratings agency downgrade of AIG, AIGFP entered into a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the agreements governing the transactions with this counterparty that requires AIGFP to post collateral. The CSA provides that one of two methodologies will be used for determining the amount of collateral to be posted. The same methodology has been used throughout the term of the CSA, and, at March 31, 2011, AIGFP had posted $222 million of collateral. The counterparty has provided quotations from dealers that it contends support using the second methodology, and contends that a total amount of approximately $1.9 billion should be posted by AIGFP. AIGFP continues to believe that the methodology currently being used is the correct one for computing collateral, that it has posted the amount of collateral required under the CSA, that the counterparty has not provided qualifying quotations and that the methodology the counterparty has used for calculating the amount of collateral to be posted is not valid. The counterparty recently notified AIGFP that it could bring litigation as soon as May 6, 2011 unless an agreement is reached either regarding the method for determining the amount of collateral to be posted, or regarding an alternative resolution of the matter.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than (1) for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and (2) for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the  161      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.

(c) Delinquency information is not provided to Capital Markets for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of this transaction. However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to Capital Markets for such referenced pools.    All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions,  162      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In virtually all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for a significant majority of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIGFP receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower, notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. For example, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. One pool containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 45 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The number of loans in this pool is 6,635. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. This transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at March 31, 2011. Two other pools, with a total net notional amount of $1.1 billion, have non-investment grade percentages less than 45 percent, with a weighted average remaining life to maturity of 3.7 years. These pools have weighted average realized losses of 0.29 percent from inception through March 31, 2011 and have current weighted average attachment points of 23.83 percent. Approximately 4.18 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 3.29 percent to 6.63 percent.  163      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.   Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on 95.96 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.11 percent to 2.24 percent, averaging 0.82 percent. Except for one transaction, which comprised less than 1.25 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.26 percent and the default rates ranged from 0.00 percent to 5.78 percent. The default rate on this one transaction was 20.99 percent with a subordination level of 56.23 percent.   For all regulatory capital transactions, where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers and information available from rating agencies, governments and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will, to the extent they retain termination rights, continue to terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.

While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

(b)Represents defaults (assets that are technically defaulted but for which the losses have not yet been realized) from inception through March 31, 2011 expressed as a percentage of the gross transaction notional amount at March 31, 2011.   Collateral   Most of the Capital Markets credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.   Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of March 31, 2011, 90.7 percent of the Capital Markets regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to CSAs linked to AIG's credit rating and 9.3 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone Master Agreement or similar agreement, under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.  Negotiated Amount — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   168      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than the Capital Markets super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended:                        (in millions)   December 31, 2010   March 31, 2011            Reference to market indices    $ 19    $ 7      Negotiated amount      217      222            Total    $ 236    $ 229              Arbitrage Portfolio — Multi-Sector CDOs   In the CDS transactions with physical settlement provisions, in respect of multi-sector CDOs, the standard CSA provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified, with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying CDO security, rather than the replacement value of the transaction. As of any date, the "market value" of the relevant CDO security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such CDO security in a market transaction on such date, while the "replacement value of the transaction" is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation (e.g., the CDO security). In cases where a formula is utilized, a transaction-specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure, which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted. These thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of AIG and/or the reference obligations, with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings. For the large majority of counterparties to these transactions, the Master Agreement and CSA cover non-CDS transactions (e.g., interest rate and cross currency swap transactions) as well as CDS transactions. As a result, the amount of collateral to be posted by AIGFP in relation to the CDS transactions will be added to or offset by the amount, if any, of the exposure AIG has to the counterparty on the non-CDS transactions.   Arbitrage Portfolio — Corporate Debt/CLOs   All of the Capital Markets corporate arbitrage-CLO transactions are subject to CSAs. These transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same Master Agreement and CSA, with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard CSA procedures outlined above.   The vast majority of corporate debt transactions are no longer subject to future collateral postings. In exchange for an upfront payment to an intermediary counterparty, AIGFP has eliminated all future obligations to post collateral on corporate debt transactions that mature after 2011.   Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.   From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFP's estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences, including at the present time. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes  169      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  are, like any other third-party valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                        (in millions)   December 31, 2010   March 31, 2011            Regulatory capital    $ 236    $ 229      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO      3,013      2,617      Arbitrage – corporate      537      541            Total    $ 3,786    $ 3,387              The amount of future collateral posting requirements generally is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future.   Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio   Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased during 2011. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $6.2 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at March 31, 2011, a BET value is available for $3.8 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $2.4 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $3.8 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  170      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at March 31, 2011 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                             Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at March 31, 2011         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS Prime   RMBS Alt-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     47 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (258 ) $ (6 ) $ (18 ) $ (119 ) $ (80 ) $ (23 ) $ (12 )                Decrease of 5 points     253     7     19     110     86     13     18            Weighted         Increase of 1 year     24     1     1     16     5     1     -        average life     5.92 years   Decrease of 1 year     (42 )   (1 )   (2 )   (31 )   (5 )   (2 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     20%   Increase of 10%     (35 )   -     (4 )   (19 )   (10 )   (1 )   (1 )                Decrease of 10%     29     -     4     14     10     -     1            Diversity score(a)     11   Increase of 5     (14 )                                                 Decrease of 5     51                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     16                                                   (a)The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Valuation models that incorporate unobservable inputs initially are calibrated to the transaction price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by observable market data.  171      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2011, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  172                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION        Item 1. Legal Proceedings    For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 11(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.       Item 1A. Risk Factors    AIG's ability to achieve its long-term aspirational goals with respect to ROE and EPS and other long-term aspirational goals are based on significant assumptions, and AIG's actual results may differ, possibly materially and adversely, from these goals.   In setting its long-term aspirational goals for ROE and EPS, AIG has made significant assumptions that include, among other things, the general conditions of markets in which it operates, revenues and combined ratios of its subsidiaries, investment yields, subsidiaries' capacity to distribute dividends to AIG Parent, AIG's ability to apply deployable capital to share repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or organic growth, AIG's ability to maintain financial leverage commensurate with its current credit ratings, the exclusion of the impact on shareholders' equity of the reversal of the tax valuation allowance, the effectiveness of AIG's cost rationalization measures, the approval of planned actions (including with respect to any share repurchases, dividend payments or acquisitions) by AIG's regulators, the overall credit rating implications of AIG's proposed strategic actions and general financial market and interest rate conditions. These assumptions are not historical facts but instead represent only AIG's expectations regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies and are outside AIG's control. It is very likely that one or more of the assumptions will not be met or will deviate materially from what is assumed. Accordingly, AIG's actual results are likely to differ from these aspirational goals and the difference may be material and adverse.   The aspirational goals and their underlying assumptions are forward-looking statements. AIG strongly cautions its shareholders and other investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or aspirational goals. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any assumptions, goals, projections or other related statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
