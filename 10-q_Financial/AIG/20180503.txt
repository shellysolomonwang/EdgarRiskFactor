Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “generally accepted accounting principles” in the United States. The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Book value per common share excluding AOCI, is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Return on equity – Adjusted after-tax income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted return on equity. Adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity. The reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (APTI) adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG: • deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;  • changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and • net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this MD&A. Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our operating segments.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 65       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Measures     Adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:    • changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits; • changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; • loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; • all net realized capital gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized capital gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);    • income or loss from discontinued operations; • net loss reserve discount benefit (charge); • pension expense related to a one-time lump sum payment to former employees; • income and loss from divested businesses;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization; and • the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain.    • General Insurance – Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. – Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural and man-made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. We believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results. • Life and Retirement – Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding agreements and mutual funds. Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.    66 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Critical Accounting Estimates       Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:         · loss reserves; · reinsurance assets; · valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; · valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; · estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; · impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment; · liability for legal contingencies; · fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; and · income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and provisional estimates associated with the Tax Act.     These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.  For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2017 Annual Report.        AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 67       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary      Executive Summary  Overview This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in our securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2017 Annual Report, in their entirety for a more detailed description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.  On January 21, 2018, we entered into an agreement to purchase Validus Holdings, Ltd. (Validus), a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance, and asset management services, for $5.6 billion in cash. This transaction strengthens our global General Insurance business by expanding our current product portfolio through additional distribution channels and advancing the tools available to enhance underwriting. The transaction is expected to close mid-2018 and is subject to obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  In February 2018, we closed a series of affiliated reinsurance transactions impacting the Legacy Portfolio. These transactions were designed to consolidate the bulk of the Legacy Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity, DSA Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (DSA Re), a Bermuda domiciled composite reinsurer, 100 percent owned by AIG. The transactions include the cession of approximately $31 billion of reserves from the Legacy Life and Retirement Run-off Lines and approximately $5 billion of reserves from the Legacy General Insurance Run-off Lines relating to business written by multiple AIG legal entities. This represented over 80 percent of the insurance reserves in the Legacy Portfolio. DSA Re has approximately $45 billion of invested assets, managed by AIG Investments, and is AIG’s main run-off reinsurer with its own dedicated management team.   AIG’S OPERATING STRUCTURE  Our Core businesses include General Insurance, Life and Retirement and Other Operations. General Insurance consists of two operating segments – North America and International. Life and Retirement consists of four operating segments – Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets. Blackboard U.S. Holdings, Inc. (Blackboard), AIG’s technology-driven subsidiary, is reported within Other Operations. We also report a Legacy Portfolio consisting of our run-off insurance lines and legacy investments that we consider non-core. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, our newly formed Bermuda domiciled composite reinsurer, DSA Re is included in our Legacy Portfolio. Consistent with how we now manage our business, our General Insurance North America operating segment primarily includes insurance businesses in the United States, Canada and Bermuda. Our General Insurance International operating segment includes insurance businesses in Japan, the United Kingdom, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, Latin America, Puerto Rico, Australia, the Middle East and Africa. General Insurance results are presented before consideration of internal reinsurance agreements.       68 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Business Segments                             General Insurance  General Insurance is a leading provider of insurance products and services for commercial and personal insurance customers.

AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 69       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Financial Performance Summary      Net Income Attributable To AIG Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in millions)              2018 and 2017 Comparison Decreased due to: • a decrease in net investment income driven by lower income from alternative investments, primarily hedge funds, losses on securities for which the fair value option was elected compared to gains in the first quarter of 2017, lower invested assets resulting from the funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO late in the first quarter 2017 and the sale of the life settlements portfolio in 2017; • higher losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from General Insurance operations, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and higher accident year losses, partially offset by pre-tax favorable prior year loss reserve development in the first quarter of 2018 compared to unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in the first quarter of 2017 mainly resulting from the reduction in Ogden discount rate during the first quarter of 2017; and • lower adjusted pre-tax income from the Legacy Portfolio.   This decrease was partially offset by:  • lower general operating and other expenses;  • gains on sale of divested businesses in the first quarter of 2018 compared to losses on sale of divested businesses in the first quarter of 2017; and • lower net realized capital losses.   For further discussion see Consolidated Results of Operations.        70 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary       Adjusted Pre-Tax Income* Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in millions)          2018 and 2017 Comparison Decreased due to: • a decrease in net investment income driven by lower income from alternative investments, primarily hedge funds, losses on securities for which the fair value option was elected compared to gains in the first quarter of 2017, lower invested assets resulting from the funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO late in the first quarter 2017 and the sale of the life settlements portfolio in 2017; • higher losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from General Insurance operations, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and higher accident year losses, partially offset by pre-tax favorable prior year loss reserve development in the first quarter of 2018 compared to unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in the first quarter of 2017 mainly resulting from the reduction in Ogden discount rate during the first quarter of 2017; and • lower adjusted pre-tax income from the Legacy Portfolio.   This decrease was partially offset by lower general operating and other expenses.

General Operating and Other Expenses Three Months Ended March 31, ($ in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison Declined $172 million due to lower employee-related expenses and professional fee reductions related to our ongoing efficiency program, divestiture of Fuji Life and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $48 million. In keeping with our broad and ongoing efforts to transform for long-term competitiveness, general operating and other expenses for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 included approximately $24 million and $181 million of pre-tax restructuring and other costs, respectively, which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges. We continue to execute initiatives focused on organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization.

AIG’s Outlook – Industry and economic factors Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2018, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, uncertainties in the annuity marketplace resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at re-evaluating the standard of care for sales of investment products and services, historically high levels of catastrophic events, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the UK’s pending withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time. Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment Interest rates increased slightly in the first quarter of 2018 but remained low relative to historical levels. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.   72 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Annuity Sales and Surrenders The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio. Reinvestment and Spread Management We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments. For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 72 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at March 31, 2018. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 69 percent at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 72 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at March 31, 2018.

General Insurance The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. Sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection. In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance run-off lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.  Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.    74 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Standard of Care – Regulatory Developments Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services that are subject to restrictions imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements set forth in the final fiduciary duty rule issued by the Department of Labor (the DOL) in April 2016 (the DOL Fiduciary Rule). On March 15, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the Fifth Circuit) ruled that the DOL exceeded its authority in promulgating the DOL Fiduciary Rule, specifically in its broadening the scope of “investment advice” fiduciary and in the terms of the best interest contract exemption. Following the Fifth Circuit’s decision, the DOL announced on March 16, 2018, that it was suspending enforcement of the DOL Fiduciary Rule pending further review. In late April 2018, several motions were filed to intervene and seek rehearing of the Fifth Circuit’s decision. If the Fifth Circuit’s decision is upheld, the Fifth Circuit’s ruling has the effect of invalidating the DOL Fiduciary Rule in its entirety. In addition to recent developments surrounding the DOL Fiduciary Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), lawmakers and state insurance regulators are also engaged in re-evaluating what is an appropriate regulatory framework around a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services. These regulatory developments, together with disruptions in the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, have created uncertainties in the annuity marketplace. These uncertainties have negatively impacted the industry sales of annuity products, including those offered by Individual Retirement as reflected in declines of premiums and deposits and net flows in our variable annuity product line during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. Additionally, on April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretations designed to address the standard of care issues and the transparency of retail investors’ relationships with investment advisors and broker-dealers. The SEC established a 90-day comment period with respect to these proposals. We are evaluating the scope and potential impact of the SEC’s proposals on our Retirement businesses and our distribution partners. Despite these developments, we believe our diverse annuity product offerings position Individual Retirement and Group Retirement to compete effectively in this evolving market environment. Impact of Currency Volatility Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability. General Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the Major Currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses:     Three Months Ended March 31,                   Percentage         Rate for 1 USD       2018   2017       Change         Currency:                             GBP       0.73   0.80       (9)   %     EUR       0.82   0.94       (13)   %     JPY       110.62   114.68       (4)   %    Unless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the General Insurance discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the Major Currencies included in the preceding table. Other Industry Developments On September 7, 2017, the UK Ministry of Justice announced a proposal to increase the Ogden rate from negative 0.75 percent to between zero and one percent. This proposal has to be passed by Parliament. We will continue to monitor the progress with this potential change.

The first quarter of 2017 included losses on the agreements to sell Fuji Life to FWD Group and certain insurance operations and assets to Fairfax; and • a decrease in net realized capital losses due to Life and Retirement guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, which reflected net realized capital gains in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to changes in movement in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment (NPA), which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program (see Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results). U.S. Tax Reform Overview On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduced the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry. At December 31, 2017, we originally recorded a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the Tax Act of $6.7 billion, including a tax charge of $6.7 billion attributable to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of $38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax. During the period ended March 31, 2018, we have not recorded any material adjustments to these provisional amounts. We continue to refine our analysis and calculations, which could impact the provisional estimates previously recorded. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2018, we have not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act.  Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income.  The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. Consistent with accounting guidance, we treat BEAT as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes in a similar manner.  In our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we made certain assumptions related to the impact of the Tax Act on our future taxable income. Generally, the Tax Act provisions result in an increase in our taxable income and, thus, accelerate utilization of our tax attribute deferred tax asset. Accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that our reliance on provisional estimates would have a material impact on our determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Repatriation Assumptions As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For the period ended March 31, 2018, we still consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. Deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. Deemed Repatriation Tax & Impact on Liquidity  The Tax Act required companies to pay a one-time transition tax, net of tax credits related to applicable foreign taxes paid, on previously untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In the determination of the deemed repatriation tax, we reviewed estimated post-1986 E&P of the relevant foreign subsidiaries, and any related non-U.S. income tax paid on such earnings. We originally recorded a provisional estimated tax benefit of $38 million at December 31, 2017. This amount is not considered to be material to our liquidity and capital resources. As we continue to refine our E&P analysis, we will refine our calculations of the one-time transition tax, which could impact the provisional estimate previously recorded.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 79       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations    Interim Tax Calculation Method We use the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing our interim tax provision. Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit is reported in the same period as the related item. Certain tax effects are also not reflected in the estimated annual effective tax rate, primarily certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the period in which the change occurs. While certain impacts of the Tax Act are included in our annual effective tax rate, we continue to refine our calculations as additional information becomes available, which may result in changes to the estimated annual effective tax rate. Income Tax expense analysis For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 22.6 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to tax charges related to income in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates higher than 21 percent, tax on GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries, valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries and non-deductible transfer pricing charges, partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement in accordance with ASU 2016-09. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 29.9 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement in accordance with ASU 2016-09, partially offset by tax charges related to the disposition of subsidiaries and non-deductible transfer pricing charges.  Business Segment Operations  Our business operations consist of General Insurance, Life and Retirement, Other Operations, and a Legacy Portfolio.  General Insurance consists of two operating segments: North America and International. Life and Retirement consists of four operating segments: Group Retirement, Individual Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets. Other Operations consists of businesses and items not allocated to our other businesses, which are primarily AIG Parent, Blackboard and Fuji Life, which was sold on April 30, 2017. Our Legacy Portfolio consists of our Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and Legacy Investments. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, DSA Re is included in our Legacy Portfolio. The following table summarizes Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) from our business segment operations.

AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 81       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     COMPETITION and challenges  Operating in a highly competitive industry,  General Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty  insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign  insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service. We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis — from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise. Our challenges include:  • long-tail Commercial Lines exposures that create added complexity in pricing and risk management; • over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;  • tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and • volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:  General Insurance – North America  Commercial Lines continues to face challenging market conditions, with excess capacity negatively impacting the rate environment and suppressing margins. However, we continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and sub-segments as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. We have also achieved positive rates for Property following recent catastrophe activity in 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018. We observe higher loss cost trends in Casualty, in particular Excess Casualty. The more profitable segments of Commercial Lines remain highly competitive; however, we continue to achieve growth in several of our high margin businesses.  Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.   General Insurance – International  We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increase due to the internationalization of customers. The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, with increased pressure on rates, particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, due to increased market capacity. Despite this, we are continuing to grow our most profitable segments across all regions and are maintaining market leadership in key developed markets. We are actively remediating our underperforming segments, maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to maintain profitability. Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines. We expect our newly formed entity in Japan – AIG Sonpo – to provide the necessary scale and platform to compete more efficiently in the Japanese market. Outside of Japan, Personal Insurance continues to invest selectively in international markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.     82 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     General INSURANCE RESULTS     Three Months Ended March 31,                       Percentage         (in millions)       2018       2017       Change         Underwriting results:                                 Net premiums written   $   6,171   $   6,297       (2)   %     Decrease in unearned premiums       512       192       167         Net premiums earned       6,683       6,489       3         Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred(a)       4,488       4,237       6         Acquisition expenses:                                 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       1,066       909       17         Other acquisition expenses       385       388       (1)         Total acquisition expenses       1,451       1,297       12         General operating expenses       995       943       6         Underwriting income (loss)       (251)       12       NM         Net investment income       761       1,049       (27)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   510   $   1,061       (52)   %       Loss ratio(a)       67.2       65.3       1.9         Acquisition ratio       21.7       20.0       1.7         General operating expense ratio        14.9       14.5       0.4         Expense ratio       36.6       34.5       2.1         Combined ratio(a)       103.8       99.8       4.0         Adjustments for accident year loss ratio, as adjusted                                 and accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:                                 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums       (5.7)       (3.5)       (2.2)         Prior year development, net of (additional) return premium on loss sensitive business       1.6       (0.6)       2.2         Adjustment for ceded premiums under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years       -       -       NM         Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted       63.1       61.2       1.9         Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted       99.7       95.7       4.0        (a) Consistent with our definition of APTI, excludes net loss reserve discount and the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain.

Business and Financial Highlights Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and a higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven by higher ceded earned premiums reflecting the additional aggregate and occurrence protection coverage added to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program. Net premiums written decreased primarily due to continued underwriting actions to strengthen our portfolio and maintain pricing discipline and changes in the 2018 reinsurance programs.  The decrease in net investment income primarily reflected lower income on alternative investments due to weaker hedge fund performance and lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from the first quarter 2017 funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO. For further discussion on the NICO transaction see Insurance Reserves.  For a description of AIG’s catastrophe reinsurance protection for 2018, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks – Natural Catastrophe Risk in our 2017 Annual Report.      North America Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to:  • lower net investment income reflecting lower hedge fund performance, lower gains on securities for which changes in fair value are recognized in earnings, as well as lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from the first quarter 2017 funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO; • higher catastrophe losses; and • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven by higher ceded earned premiums primarily related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program.          AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 85       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        North America Net Premiums Written Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison Net premiums written decreased primarily due to: • lower production primarily in Casualty, commercial property within Property, D&O products within Financial Lines and programs business due to underwriting actions taken to strengthen our portfolio and to maintain pricing discipline; and • higher ceded premiums due to changes in the 2018 reinsurance programs. This decrease was partially offset by growth in Accident and Health within Personal Insurance and the positive impact on market pricing for Property following recent catastrophe activity.           North America Combined Ratios Three Months Ended March 31,        2018 and 2017 Comparison  The increase in the combined ratio reflected an increase in both the loss ratio and the expense ratio. This increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to:  • higher catastrophe losses; and  • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to higher ceded premiums related to the 2018 North American catastrophe reinsurance program and an increase in loss estimates in the second half of 2017, which was partially offset by a favorable change in the portfolio mix.   The increase in the expense ratio reflected a higher acquisition expense ratio driven primarily by lower earned premium due to changes in the business mix and in the 2018 reinsurance programs.      86 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     International Results    Three Months Ended March 31,                       Percentage         (in millions)       2018       2017       Change         Underwriting results:                                 Net premiums written   $   4,132   $   3,974       4   %     Decrease in unearned premiums       (141)       (434)       68         Net premiums earned       3,991       3,540       13         Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred(a)       2,335       2,074       13         Acquisition expenses:                                 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       708       586       21         Other acquisition expenses       231       226       2         Total acquisition expenses       939       812       16         General operating expenses       640       579       11         Underwriting income(b)       77       75       3         Net investment income       113       158       (28)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   190   $   233       (18)   %       Loss ratio(a)       58.5       58.6       (0.1)         Acquisition ratio       23.5       22.9       0.6         General operating expense ratio        16.0       16.4       (0.4)         Expense ratio       39.5       39.3       0.2         Combined ratio(a)       98.0       97.9       0.1         Adjustments for accident year loss ratio, as adjusted                                 and accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:                                 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums       (1.9)       (1.9)       -         Prior year development, net of (additional) return premium on loss sensitive business       0.7       (2.9)       3.6         Adjustment for ceded premiums under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years       -       -       NM         Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted       57.3       53.8       3.5         Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted       96.8       93.1       3.7        (a) Consistent with our definition of APTI, excludes net loss reserve discount and the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain. (b) As result of the Fuji Merger Impact, the first quarter of 2018 includes two additional months of operating earnings increasing Net premiums written, Net premiums earned, Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, and Adjusted pre-tax income by approximately $300 million, $300 million, $200 million and $15 million, respectively. Business and Financial Highlights Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower income on alternative investments driven by a decrease in portfolio holdings as well as weaker hedge fund performance, and losses on securities for which changes in fair value are recognized in earnings compared to gains in the prior year period. The combined ratio remained flat due to a slightly higher expense ratio offset by a slightly lower loss ratio. Net premium written, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased primarily due to higher ceded premiums related to the changes in 2018 reinsurance programs as well as portfolio optimization and continued challenging market conditions,  partially offset by the Fuji Merger Impact.     AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 87       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        International Adjusted Pre-Tax Income  Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison Adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to: • higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven primarily by higher severe losses and higher ceded earned premiums related to the additional reinsurance protection against severe losses added for international locations on a global basis and the 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program; and • lower net investment income mainly driven by a decrease in alternative investments portfolio holdings as well as lower hedge fund performance, and losses on securities for which changes in fair value are recognized in earnings compared to gains in the prior year period.  This decrease was partially offset by favorable prior year loss reserve development in the first quarter of 2018 compared to unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in the first quarter of 2017 mainly resulting from the reduction in Ogden discount rate during the first quarter of 2017.             International Net Premiums Written Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison Net premiums written decreased, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, due to: • higher ceded premiums related to the changes in 2018 reinsurance programs;  • lower production in our Japan business reflecting our focus on profitability combined with a competitive market environment; • lower production in Property and Casualty primarily driven by execution of our portfolio optimization strategy in Europe; and • the sale of certain of our insurance operations to Fairfax. This decrease was partially offset by the Fuji Merger Impact.        88 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance        International Combined Ratios Three Months Ended March 31,         2018 and 2017 Comparison The combined ratio remained flat due to a slightly higher expense ratio offset by a slightly lower loss ratio. The increase in expense ratio reflected a slightly higher acquisition ratio mainly due to a decrease in earned premiums driven by the changes in 2018 reinsurance programs. The slightly lower loss ratio reflected favorable prior year loss reserve development in 2018, primarily from Personal Insurance, compared to unfavorable prior year loss reserve development in 2017 mainly resulting from the reduction in Ogden discount rate.  The lower loss ratio was almost entirely offset by a higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven primarily by higher severe losses and higher ceded premiums related to the changes in 2018 reinsurance programs.

AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 91       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     COMPETITION and challenges  Life and Retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the U.S. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including banks and  other  life insurance and mutual fund companies. Competition  is  primarily  based  on  product  pricing  and  design,  distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business. Our business remains competitive due to its  long-standing  market leading  positions,  innovative  products,  distribution  relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings. Our primary challenges include:  · a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields; · increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and peers with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space; · increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have created uncertainty that is affecting industry growth; and · upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:  Individual Retirement  Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in  this product space. In  response  to  the  continued  low interest  rate environment, which  has  added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive  to  the  level of interest rates.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry. Additionally, regulatory developments surrounding the DOL Fiduciary Rule and standard of care for the sale of investment products and services have created uncertainties in the annuity marketplace. These uncertainties have negatively impacted the industry sales of annuity products, including those offered by Individual Retirement.   Group Retirement  Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the VALIC  brand. VALIC  is a leading retirement  plan provider in the  U.S. for  K-12  schools  and school  districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for  both plan  sponsors and individual participants.  To  meet  this  challenge,  VALIC  is investing  in a  client-focused  technology  platform  to support  improved compliance  and self-service functionality. VALIC’s  service model  pairs self-service  tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.   Life Insurance  Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, as well as to supplement retirement income.  In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio has been evolving. We will continue to place a strong focus on indexed universal life products and de-emphasize products with long-duration interest rate guarantees.    92 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the United States, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.   Institutional Markets  Institutional Markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. Demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. We expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities. Tax reform may lead to new opportunities in the stable value wrap market.

While interest rates had slightly improved, rates remained low relative to historical levels. Excluding the impact of deposits from the FHLB funding agreement, premiums and deposits declined in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net flows declined and continued to be negative primarily due to lower deposits and higher surrenders. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased, reflecting declines in equity market performance, base net investment spread and gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher alternative investment returns, policy fees and advisory fees, as well as the receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities. Fixed Annuities base net investment spread in the first quarter of 2018 declined compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in accretion income and reinvestment yields.   94 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement        Individual Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to: • lower equity market performance in the first quarter of 2018, which contributed to increases in policyholder benefits and DAC amortization; • decline in base net investment spread primarily in Fixed Annuities driven by decreases in accretion income and reinvestment yields. In addition, income from base portfolio reflected declines driven by lower invested assets in Fixed Annuities, partially offset by asset growth in Index Annuities; and • decline in net investment income, primarily from lower gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and income from bond call and tender, partially offset by higher returns on alternative investments and the receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher policy fees and advisory fees, net of expenses, primarily driven by asset growth in Variable Annuities.    Individual Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Individual Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to competitive market rates and continued regulatory uncertainties.  Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, FHLB funding agreements and mutual funds under administration.  Net flows for annuity products in Individual Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. Deposits from FHLB funding agreements were excluded from net flows of Individual Retirement, as net flows from these funding agreements are not considered part of the metric to measure Individual Retirement’s core recurring performance. The following table presents a reconciliation of Individual Retirement GAAP premiums to premiums and deposits:    Three Months Ended March 31,                     (in millions)       2018       2017     Premiums   $   12   $   28     Deposits       4,347       3,357     Other       (1)       (3)     Premiums and deposits   $   4,358   $   3,382      AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 95       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     The following table presents surrenders as a percentage of average reserves:    Three Months Ended March 31,                         2018       2017         Surrenders as a percentage of average reserves                     Fixed Annuities   7.4   %   7.0   %     Variable and Index Annuities   6.4       6.0        The following table presents reserves for Fixed Annuities and Variable and Index Annuities by surrender charge category:        March 31, 2018       December 31, 2017                     Variable                   Variable                 Fixed       and Index           Fixed       and Index         (in millions)       Annuities       Annuities           Annuities       Annuities         No surrender charge   $   31,867   $   19,229       $   32,299   $   18,896         Greater than 0% - 2%       1,713       6,088           1,704       6,045         Greater than 2% - 4%       1,422       9,708           1,560       9,470         Greater than 4%       13,505       34,156           13,329       34,677         Non-surrenderable       1,625       447           1,665       429         Total reserves   $   50,132   $   69,628       $   50,557   $   69,517        Individual Retirement annuities are typically subject to a four- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. For Variable and Index Annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charges at March 31, 2018 has decreased compared to December 31, 2017 due to normal aging of the business and continued decline in sales. The increase in reserves with no surrender charge contributed to the increase in the surrender rate for Variable and Index Annuities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Increases in market interest rates in the first quarter of 2018 contributed to the increase in the surrender rate for Fixed Annuities in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows:    Individual Retirement Premiums and Deposits (P&D) and Net Flows Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison  • Fixed Annuities premiums and deposits decreased primarily due to lower bank distribution sales, partially offset by higher broker dealer distribution sales. Net flows declined and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders and lower premiums and deposits primarily driven by competitive market rates and continued regulatory uncertainties. • Variable and Index Annuities premiums and deposits increased primarily due to higher index annuity sales, partially offset by lower variable annuity sales driven by continued regulatory uncertainties. Net flows declined primarily due to higher surrenders partially offset by increased sales. • Funding Agreements premiums and deposits in the first quarter of 2018 reflected deposits from the FHLB funding agreement, which were excluded from reported net flows. • Retail Mutual Funds net flows declined and continued to be negative reflecting lower deposits and higher withdrawals due to continued negative industry trends in U.S. equity actively managed funds.          96 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Group Retirement Results    Three Months Ended March 31,                       Percentage         (in millions)       2018       2017       Change         Revenues:                                 Premiums   $   6   $   9       (33)   %     Policy fees       112       99       13         Net investment income       582       555       5         Advisory fee and other income       61       55       11         Benefits and expenses:                                 Policyholder benefits and losses incurred       16       21       (24)         Interest credited to policyholder account balances       275       278       (1)         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       25       22       14         Non deferrable insurance commissions       29       27       7         Advisory fee expenses       22       18       22         General operating expenses       102       102       -         Interest expense       10       7       43         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   282   $   243       16   %     Base net investment spread:                                 Base yield       4.53   %   4.68   %   (15)   bps     Cost of funds       2.72       2.81       (9)         Base net investment spread       1.81   %   1.87   %   (6)   bps    Business and Financial Highlights Group Retirement is focused on implementing initiatives to grow its business.

Group Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Group Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities.

Group Retirement annuities are typically subject to a five- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. At March 31, 2018, Group Retirement annuity reserves declined compared to December 31, 2017 primarily due to negative net flows, as well as less favorable equity market performance in the first quarter of 2018. The amount and proportion of annuity reserves that have no surrender charge decreased primarily due to higher group plan surrenders.

These assets included approximately $1.6 billion resulting from an affiliated reinsurance transaction with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company. DSA Re has additional eligible capital under the Bermuda Monetary Authority capital framework in the form of $550 million in letter of credit agreements. In the first quarter of 2018, DSA Re disbursed tax sharing payments of $167 million to AIG Parent.    Legacy Portfolio Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2018 and 2017 Comparison Adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to: • lower Legacy Life and Retirement earnings compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to lower net investment income and a refinement in reserves related to payout annuities, partially offset by modest mortality gains; • lower Legacy General Insurance earnings compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to lower net investment income; and • lower Legacy Investment earnings compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to the continued decrease in net assets of the Legacy Investments Portfolio, which was primarily driven by the sale of the Life Settlements portfolio in 2017.       106 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments      Investments  Overview Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective operating segments and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.    Investment Highlights in the First Quarter of 2018     • A slight rise in interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as the adoption of the Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities standard (Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Standard) on January 1, 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of unrealized gains in our equity securities to retained earnings, resulted in a net unrealized loss in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $8.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 from approximately $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2017. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • During the first quarter of 2018, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately $0.7 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  • We sold our remaining interest in Arch Capital, which we received as part of the consideration for selling United Guaranty to Arch in 2016.    Investment Strategies  Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in General Insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by General Insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  • While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life and Retirement companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.  • AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. Attribution of Net Investment Income to Operating Segments Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses. For General Insurance — North America and International and Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the General Insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 107       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    For Life and Retirement — Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life and Retirement companies. All invested assets of the Life and Retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment. Asset Liability Measurement For the General Insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The General Insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the General Insurance companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, the General Insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.2 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.5 years. The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life and Retirement companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.  The Life and Retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies, we have reduced the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.3 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the Life and Retirement companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 21.9 years.   108 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade.  The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.   For a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings see Investments – Credit Ratings.

Approximately 17 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. Moody’s Investors Service Inc.

(S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2018, approximately 23 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 35 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.       AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 109       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    Composite AIG Credit Ratings With respect to our fixed maturity securities, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity securities), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.  For a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments see Enterprise Risk Management.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments To determine other-than-temporary impairments, we use fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized. The following tables present other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in earnings on fixed maturity securities, equity securities, private equity funds and hedge funds.

Upon the adoption of the Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Standard on January 1, 2018, equity securities are no longer required to be evaluated for other-than-temporary impairments   We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $148 million and $188 million in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  For a discussion of our other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report.    116 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    The following table shows the aging of the pre-tax unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities, the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost or cost, and the number of respective items in each category:    March 31, 2018   Less Than or Equal           Greater Than 20%           Greater Than 50%                         to 20% of Cost(b)           to 50% of Cost(b)           of Cost(b)           Total      Aging(a)           Unrealized                   Unrealized                   Unrealized                   Unrealized         (dollars in millions)       Cost(c)       Loss   Items(e)           Cost(c)        Loss   Items(e)           Cost(c)        Loss   Items(e)            Cost(c)        Loss(d)    Items(e)      Investment grade                                                                                                 bonds                                                                                                 0-6 months   $   50,268   $   1,165   6,405       $   360   $   126   7       $   -   $   -   -       $   50,628   $   1,291   6,412     7-11 months       9,864       364   1,140           -       -   -           -       -   -           9,864       364   1,140     12 months or more       13,024       740   1,547           68       20   13           37       23   12           13,129       783   1,572     Total   $   73,156   $   2,269   9,092       $   428   $   146   20       $   37   $   23   12       $   73,621   $   2,438   9,124     Below investment                                                                                                 grade bonds                                                                                                 0-6 months   $   4,838   $   119   2,248       $   51   $   15   32       $   9   $   6   7       $   4,898   $   140   2,287     7-11 months       369       24   270           17       5   13           -       -   -           386       29   283     12 months or more       1,858       122   407           218       59   32           17       9   4           2,093       190   443     Total   $   7,065   $   265   2,925       $   286   $   79   77       $   26   $   15   11       $   7,377   $   359   3,013     Total bonds                                                                                                 0-6 months   $   55,106   $   1,284   8,653       $   411   $   141   39       $   9   $   6   7       $   55,526   $   1,431   8,699     7-11 months       10,233       388   1,410           17       5   13           -       -   -           10,250       393   1,423     12 months or more       14,882       862   1,954           286       79   45           54       32   16           15,222       973   2,015     Total(e)   $   80,221   $   2,534   12,017       $   714   $   225   97       $   63   $   38   23       $   80,998   $   2,797   12,137    (a) Represents the number of consecutive months that fair value has been less than cost by any amount.

(e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary. Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the first quarter of 2018, net unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities decreased by $5.0 billion due primarily to an increase in rates and a widening of credit spreads.  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the first quarter of 2017, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $0.9 billion due primarily to a decrease in rates and a narrowing of credit spreads.

Net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2018 were primarily related to other-than-temporary impairment charges and derivative losses, which were higher than the gains on sales of securities and foreign exchange gains. Net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2017 were primarily related to derivative and hedge accounting losses, and impairments, which were higher than the foreign exchange gains and the gains recognized on the sales of securities.  Variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected gains in the first quarter of 2018 compared to losses in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to changes in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the valuation of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) embedded derivative, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program.

PRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT The following table summarizes incurred (favorable) unfavorable prior year development net of reinsurance by segment:    Three Months Ended March 31,                     (in millions)       2018       2017     General Insurance:                     North America*   $   (78)   $   (78)     International       (30)       102     Total General Insurance   $   (108)   $   24     Legacy Portfolio - Run-off Lines        (2)       (14)     Total prior year (favorable) unfavorable development   $   (110)   $   10    * Includes the amortization attributed to the deferred gain at inception from the NICO adverse development reinsurance agreement of $62 million and $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Consistent with our definition of APTI, prior year development excludes the portion of unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under the NICO reinsurance agreements of $9 million and $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain of $(23) million and $(3) million over those same periods.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 119       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     Net Loss Development In the first quarter of 2018, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of $110 million. For North America, the favorable development was primarily driven by amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO. For International, the favorable development was driven by Europe and Japan Personal Insurance.  In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized adverse prior year loss reserve development of $10 million. We increased our loss reserves by $102 million as a result of the decision made by the UK Ministry of Justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump-sum bodily injury payouts, known as the Ogden rate. This prior year loss reserve increase was almost entirely offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO and favorable development from U.S. Property and Special Risks of $35 million as a result of a reduction in catastrophe losses.

These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above. This may affect the comparability of the data presented in our tables.  Significant Reinsurance Agreements In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement. For a description of AIG’s catastrophe reinsurance protection for 2018, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks – Natural Catastrophe Risk in our 2017 Annual Report. The table below shows the calculation of the deferred gain on the adverse development reinsurance agreement as of March 31, 2018 and as of December 31, 2017, showing the effect of discounting of loss reserves and amortization of the deferred gain.

AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 121       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The lines of business subject to this agreement have been the source of the majority of the prior year adverse development charges over the past several years. The agreement is expected to result in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. In addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets. For a summary of significant reinsurers see Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Operations Risks – General Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks – Reinsurance Recoverable in our 2017 Annual Report. LIFE AND ANNUITY reserves and dac The following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs. Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. The liabilities for GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors. In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.  For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Life and Retirement Companies Key Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs in our 2017 Annual Report.  Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following: • The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero; • The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and • The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include: • Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative; • Realized volatility versus implied volatility;  • Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and • Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.   122 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:                                March 31,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2018       2017     Reconciliation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target:                                         Embedded derivative liability                       $   1,601   $   1,994     Exclude non-performance risk adjustment                           (1,875)       (1,947)     Embedded derivative liability, excluding NPA                           3,476       3,941     Adjustments for risk margins and differences in valuation                           (1,450)       (1,557)     Economic hedge target liability                       $   2,026   $   2,384    Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss) The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits. The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:    Three Months Ended March 31,                     (in millions)       2018       2017     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA   $   551   $   591     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio:                     Fixed maturity securities       (77)       11     Interest rate derivative contracts       (406)       (183)     Equity derivative contracts       74       (409)     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio       (409)       (581)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives excluding NPA, net of hedging portfolio        142       10     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to NPA spread       72       (185)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to change in NPA volume       (144)       (203)     Total change due to NPA       (72)       (388)     Net impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   70   $   (378)                           By Consolidated Income Statement line                     Net Investment Income   $   (77)   $   11     Net Realized capital gains (losses)       147       (389)     Net Impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   70   $   (378)    The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the first quarter of 2018 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by gains from the impact of widening credit spreads on the NPA spread, higher interest rates and equity market volatility, partially offset by the impact on NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher interest rates. The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by losses from the impact of tightening credit spreads on the NPA spread, and the impact on the NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher equity markets.    AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 123       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA, in the first quarter of 2018 reflected gains from equity market volatility and reductions in risk margins due higher interest rates, partially offset by losses from the related hedging portfolio. The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA, in the first quarter of 2017 was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio. Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis, due to the NPA and other risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below. Change in Economic Hedge Target The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to widening credit spreads, higher interest rates and equity market volatility. Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivatives, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio: • Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the first quarter of 2018 reflected losses due to increases in interest rates and widening of credit spreads, while the first quarter of 2017 had a small gain, due to tightening of credit spreads. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in net losses in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 driven by higher interest rates.  • The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, reflected gains in the first quarter of 2018 compared to losses in the in the same period in the prior year, which varied based on the relative change in equity market returns in the respective periods. DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC, including VOBA, within the Life and Retirement companies, excluding DAC of the Legacy Portfolio:     Three Months Ended March 31,                     (in millions)       2018       2017     Balance, beginning of year   $   7,637   $   7,571     Acquisition costs deferred       249       239     Amortization expense:                     Related to realized capital gains and losses       (27)       53     All other operating amortization       (246)       (228)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange       12       4     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments       564       49     Balance, end of period*   $   8,189   $   7,688    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion at March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   124 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income (OCI) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow Loss Adjustments) with an offset to OCI to be recorded. Shadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.  Market interest rates increased in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in a $4.1 billion decrease in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the Life and Retirement companies at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected increases in DAC and unearned revenues and a decrease in future policy benefit liabilities compared to December 31, 2017, while the shadow Loss Adjustments reflected a decrease in future policy benefit liabilities.

It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.  See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement in the 2017 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.  Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share and/or warrant repurchases.      AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 127       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ACTIVITY FOR the first quarter of 2018  Sources  AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries(a) During the first quarter of 2018, AIG Parent received $696 million in dividends from subsidiaries. Of this amount, $310 million consisted of dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our General Insurance companies and $386 million consisted of dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash from our Life and Retirement companies. AIG Parent also received a net amount of $378 million in tax sharing payments in the form of cash from our insurance businesses in the first quarter of 2018. The tax sharing payments may be subject to adjustment in future periods. Debt Issuance In March 2018, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.200% Notes Due 2028; $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Notes Due 2048; and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Fixed-To-Floating Rate Series A-9 Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2048 (Junior Subordinated Debentures). We intend to use the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Validus. We will be required to redeem the Junior Subordinated Debentures at a redemption price equal to 101 percent of the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest (i) if our acquisition of Validus is not consummated on or prior to September 21, 2018 (or such later date as extended by agreement under the agreement to purchase Validus) or (ii) if prior to such date the agreement to purchase Validus is terminated.  Uses  Debt Reduction(b) We made repurchases of and repayments on debt instruments of approximately $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2018. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $260 million during the first quarter of 2018. Dividend We paid a cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock during the first quarter of 2018 totaling $289 million.  Repurchase of Common Stock We repurchased approximately 5 million shares of AIG Common Stock during the first quarter of 2018, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $298 million.     (a) In April 2018, we received approximately $180 million in additional dividends in the form of cash from our General Insurance companies. These dividends had been declared during the first quarter of 2018. (b) In April 2018, we announced that we will redeem all of our outstanding 8.000% Series A-7 Junior Subordinated Debentures and 8.625% Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures on May 22, 2018, in each case for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of April 20, 2018, €12,350,000 aggregate principal amount of the Series A-7 Junior Subordinated Debentures were outstanding and £5,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures were outstanding.      128 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash  The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:    Three Months Ended March 31,                             (in millions)               2018       2017     Sources:                             Net cash provided by other investing activities           $   -   $   14,499     Changes in policyholder contract balances               2,909       320     Issuance of long-term debt               3,039       151     Total sources               5,948       14,970     Uses:                              Net cash used in operating activities               (938)       (10,336)     Net cash used in other investing activities               (1,972)       -     Repayments of long-term debt               (1,327)       (602)     Purchases of AIG Common Stock               (298)       (3,585)     Dividends paid               (289)       (307)     Net cash used in other financing activities               (1,548)       (25)     Total uses               (6,372)       (14,855)     Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash               58       (82)     Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash           $   (366)   $   33    The following table presents a summary of AIG’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:    Three Months Ended March 31,                                 (in millions)                   2018       2017     Summary:                                  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities               $   (938)   $   (10,336)      Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                   (1,972)       14,499      Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                   2,486       (4,048)      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash                   58       (82)     Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash                   (366)       33     Cash and restricted cash at beginning of year                   2,737       2,107     Change in cash of businesses held for sale                   -       52     Cash and restricted cash at end of period               $   2,371   $   2,192    Operating Cash Flow Activities  Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $357 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $354 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding interest payments, AIG had operating cash outflows of $581 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to operating cash outflows of $10.0 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The operating cash outflow in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to payment for the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO.     AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 129       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Investing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash used by investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.0 billion compared to investing cash inflows of $14.5 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included sales of certain investments to fund the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO. Financing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 reflected: • approximately $289 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock; • approximately $298 million to repurchase approximately 5 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $1.7 billion in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2017 reflected: • approximately $307 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock; • approximately $3.6 billion to repurchase approximately 56 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and  • approximately $451 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries AIG Parent As of March 31, 2018, AIG Parent had approximately $13.0 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management. In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.   130 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   March 31, 2018   December 31, 2017     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   4,642   $   2,114     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       3,815       5,172     Total AIG Parent liquidity       8,457       7,286     Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(c)       4,500       4,500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   12,957   $   11,786    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $3.6 billion and $1.7 billion as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. (c) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility see Credit Facilities below. Insurance Companies We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements. Our General Insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. General Insurance companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of approximately $80 million and $190 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2018 were used primarily for short-term cash management purposes. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from the FHLBs at March 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. In addition, $3.4 billion and $606 million were due to the FHLBs in the respective districts of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Institutional Markets operating segments, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits.  Certain of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. At both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $2.9 billion of securities subject to these agreements and $3.0 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 131       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In February 2018, AIG Parent entered into a CMA with DSA Re. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain available statutory capital and surplus of DSA Re’s long term business fund and its general business account at or above a stress threshold percentage of its projected enhanced capital requirement in respect of the applicable fund, as defined under Bermuda law. As of March 31, 2018, the stress threshold percentage under this CMA was 125 percent. AIG Parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions. These financial institutions issue letters of credit from time to time to certain of our General Insurance companies for insurance regulatory and reinsurance collateral purposes or for capital support, and the total outstanding amount of issued letters of credit for these purposes was approximately $2.4 billion at March 31, 2018. Letters of credit issued in support of the Life and Retirement companies totaled approximately $906 million at March 31, 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, AIG Parent issued letters of credit in support of DSA Re that totaled $550 million at March 31, 2018. During 2016, we created a new Switzerland-domiciled international holding company, AIG International Holdings, GmbH (AIGIH), which is intended to be the ultimate holding company for all of our international entities. This international holding company structure is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify our organizational structure, and is expected to facilitate the optimization of our international capital strategy from both a regulatory and a tax perspective. Through May 2, 2018, substantially all of our international operations have been transferred to AIGIH. We will continue to monitor our international holding company structure in light of regulatory, tax and other developments, to ensure that this strategy continues to be effective. In the first quarter of 2018, our General Insurance companies paid approximately $310 million in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. government and government-sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. In the first quarter of 2018, our Life and Retirement companies collectively paid a total of $386 million in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash to AIG Parent.  Credit Facilities We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2022. As of March 31, 2018, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Facility. Our ability to utilize the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to utilize the Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.    132 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:    March 31, 2018           Payments due by Period              Total   Remainder of       2019 -       2021 -                     (in millions)       Payments        2018       2020       2022       2023       Thereafter     Insurance operations                                                     Loss reserves   $   80,019   $   18,155   $   22,970   $   12,837   $   4,195   $   21,862     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       242,309       12,871       30,140       28,273       13,005       158,020     Borrowings       995       -       122       231       -       642     Interest payments on borrowings       878       26       99       99       50       604     Other long-term obligations       -       -       -       -       -       -     Total   $   324,201   $   31,052   $   53,331   $   41,440   $   17,250   $   181,128     Other                                                      Borrowings   $   25,858   $   990   $   2,637   $   3,250   $   1,838   $   17,143     Interest payments on borrowings       16,546       1,030       2,110       1,836       838       10,732     Other long-term obligations       440       68       177       161       -       34     Total   $   42,844   $   2,088   $   4,924   $   5,247   $   2,676   $   27,909     Consolidated                                                     Loss reserves   $   80,019   $   18,155   $   22,970   $   12,837   $   4,195   $   21,862     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       242,309       12,871       30,140       28,273       13,005       158,020     Borrowings       26,853       990       2,759       3,481       1,838       17,785     Interest payments on borrowings       17,424       1,056       2,209       1,935       888       11,336     Other long-term obligations(a)       440       68       177       161       -       34     Total(b)   $   367,045   $   33,140   $   58,255   $   46,687   $   19,926   $   209,037    (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (b) Does not reflect obligations in connection with the agreement to purchase Validus Holdings, Ltd., which was entered into on January 21, 2018 and is expected to close mid-2018 subject to obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Also does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.7 billion. See Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss Reserves Loss reserves relate to our General Insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our General Insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life and Retirement companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life and Retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life and Retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.    AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Borrowings Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. For further information on indemnification obligations see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities. (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.   134 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     (e) Includes a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $200 million between AerCap Ireland Capital Designated Activity Company, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility) scheduled to mature in October 2019. The AerCap Credit Facility permits loans for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility. (f) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining annual pension contribution for 2018 is expected to be approximately $44 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Tax Matters If the settlement agreements in principle are concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. Although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.3 billion. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. There remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payments, which are not likely to be made before sometime in 2019. For additional information regarding this matter see Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities  We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.  For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

Collateral posted to third parties was $2.0 billion at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties. (b) Primarily represents adjustments to the fair value of debt. (c) Includes primarily borrowings with Federal Home Loan Banks by our U.S. insurance companies. These borrowings are short term in nature and related activity is presented net of issuances and maturities and repayments.

They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.   138 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock  On February 8, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018. On May 2, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2018. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, as discussed further in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase of $2.5 billion to the share repurchase authorization. As of May 2, 2018, approximately $2.0 billion remained under the authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $298 million pursuant to this authorization.

For a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report.    Enterprise Risk Management  Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2017 Annual Report. Credit Risk Management Overview Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.  For further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures see Investments – Available-for-Sale Securities.   140 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Our credit risk management framework incorporates the following elements:     Risk Identification   including the ongoing capture and monitoring of all existing, contingent, potential and emerging credit risk exposures, whether funded or unfunded     Risk Measurement   comprising risk ratings, default probabilities, loss given default and expected loss parameters, exposure calculations, stress testing and other risk analytics     Risk Limits   including, but not limited to, a system of single obligor or risk group-based AIG-wide house limits and sub-limits for corporates, financial institutions, sovereigns and sub-sovereigns when appropriate and a defined process for identifying, evaluating, documenting and approving, if appropriate, breaches of and exceptions to such limits     Risk Delegations   a comprehensive credit risk delegation framework from the Chief Credit Officer (CCO) to authorized credit professionals throughout the company     Risk Evaluation, Monitoring and Reporting   including the ongoing analysis and assessment of credit risks, trending of those risks and reporting of other key risk metrics and limits to the CCO and senior management, as may be required     Credit Reserving   including but not limited to development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and (ii) other-than-temporary impairments for securities portfolios    Market Risk Management Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The Risk Officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Many of our market risk exposures related to interest rates and equity returns are associated with our Life and Retirement companies and relate to both asset and liability exposures. In addition, these exposures are long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. These interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 141       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Identification Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.  Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:     Equity prices   We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.     Residential and commercial real estate values   Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.     Interest rates   Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.     Credit spreads   Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.     Foreign exchange (FX) rates   We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.     Commodity prices   Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.     Inflation   Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.      142 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Measurement  Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis. In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.  We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:             Examples include:     Sensitivity analysis   measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input   • a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,  • a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and  • a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.     Scenario analysis   uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures   • a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, or  • a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets.

Excluded were $8.7 billion of loans. In addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2017, the analysis covered $276.8 billion of $289.6 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.2 billion of loans. In addition, $4.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. (b) At March 31, 2018, the analysis excluded $6.7 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $80 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $353 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. At December 31, 2017, the analysis excluded $6.0 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $190 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $334 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. (c) The balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under “Interest rate sensitive liabilities” above, and are not additive. (d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above. We use duration and convexity metrics to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes for interest rate sensitive assets excluding derivatives and long-term debt. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity of a derivative is calculated as change in its value with respect to plus a 100 basis point change in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value of the derivative under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.  We evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which could produce different results.  We evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset-based fees, changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing DAC, or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products. In addition, this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy. Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.  Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at March 31, 2018, decreased by $226 million compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $237 million decrease in our euro position primarily due to an increase in reserves. For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.  AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 145       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Identification  The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.     Market/Monetization Risk   Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.     Cash Flow Mismatch Risk   Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.     Event Funding Risk   Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.     Financing Risk   We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.    Risk Measurement Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.  We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:     Minimum Liquidity Limits   Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.     Coverage Ratios   Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.     Cash Flow Forecasts   Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.     Stress Testing   Asset liquidity and Coverage Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.    Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.     146 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    Regulatory Environment   Overview Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. We expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. For updated information on the impact of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and the related regulatory developments regarding a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services, see Executive Summary – AIG’s Outlook – Industry and Economic Factors – Standard of Care – Regulatory Developments. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report.     AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 147       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Glossary  Accident year  The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs and certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting.  Additional premium represents a premium on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium imposed at the beginning of the policy. An additional premium may be assessed if the insured’s risk is found to have increased significantly. Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Assets under administration include assets under management and Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement mutual fund assets that we sell or administer.  Assets under management include assets in the general and separate accounts of our subsidiaries that support liabilities and surplus related to our life and annuity insurance products and the notional value of stable value wrap contracts. Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book value per common share excluding AOCI is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels. CVA Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in AIGFP's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only, without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk in the fair value measurement of all derivative net liability positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business.   148 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments  An adjustment to DAC and Reserves for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC and Unearned Revenue amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. An adjustment to benefit reserves for investment-oriented products is also recognized to reflect the application of the benefit ratio to the accumulated assessments that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (collectively referred to as “shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments”). For long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. General operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses. GIC/GIA Guaranteed Investment Contract/Guaranteed Investment Agreement A contract whereby the seller provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. G-SII Global Systemically Important Insurer An insurer that is deemed globally systemically important (that is, of such size, market importance and global interconnectedness that the distress or failure of the insurer would cause significant dislocation in the global financial system and adverse economic consequences across a range of countries) by the Financial Stability Board, in consultation with and based on a methodology developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.  Loss Ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.  Loss reserve development  The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to prior years as a result of the re-estimation of loss reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. Natural catastrophe and man-made losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period, while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period.   AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 149       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Noncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. Policy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses. Pool  A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage.  Premiums and deposits – Life and Retirement include direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and group benefit policies, and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, FHLB funding agreements and mutual funds. Prior year development See Loss reserve development. RBC Risk-Based Capital A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. Reinstatement premium Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. Retroactive Reinsurance  S ee Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance. Return on equity – Adjusted after-tax income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Return on equity) is a non-GAAP measure and is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. Adjusted Return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity.  Return premium represents amounts given back to the insured in the case of a cancellation, an adjustment to the rate or an overpayment of an advance premium. Salvage  The amount that can be recovered by an insurer for the sale of damaged goods for which a policyholder has been indemnified (and to which title was transferred). Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophic individual first-party losses, surety and trade credit losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance and salvage and subrogation. SIA Sales Inducement Asset Represents enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on certain annuity and investment contract products that meet the criteria to be deferred and amortized over the life of the contract. Solvency II  Legislation in the European Union which reforms the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) was adopted on November 25, 2009 and became effective on January 1, 2016. Subrogation  The amount of recovery for claims we have paid our policyholders, generally from a negligent third party or such party’s insurer.  Surrender charge A charge levied against an investor for the early withdrawal of funds from a life insurance or annuity contract, or for the cancellation of the agreement.

ITEM 4 | Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.     152 AIG | First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS        Part II – Other Information  ITEM 1 | Legal Proceedings For a discussion of legal proceedings see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
