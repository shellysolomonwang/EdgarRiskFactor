Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “generally accepted accounting principles” in the United States. The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Book value per common share excluding AOCI, is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Return on equity – After-tax operating income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted return on equity. Adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity. The reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. After-tax operating income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the tax effected pre-tax operating income (PTOI) adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG: • deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges; and • uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance. General operating expenses, operating basis is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses: include (i) certain loss adjustment expenses, reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and (ii) certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income, and exclude (i) advisory fee expenses, (ii) non-deferrable insurance commissions, (iii) direct marketing and acquisition expenses, net of deferrals, (iv) non-operating litigation reserves and (v) other expense related to an asbestos retroactive reinsurance agreement. We use General operating expenses, operating basis, because we believe it provides a more meaningful indication of our ordinary course of business operating costs, regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within our segment results. The majority of these expenses are employee-related costs. For example, Other acquisition expenses and Losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee-related costs in the underwriting and claims functions, respectively. Excluded from this measure are non-operating expenses (such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves), direct marketing expenses, insurance company assessments and non-deferrable commissions.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 73      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Measures     We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this MD&A. Operating revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Operating revenues is a GAAP measure for our operating segments. Pre-tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our modules (including geography). These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. PTOI is a GAAP measure for our operating segments.    • changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits; • changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; • loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • non‑qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital gains and losses;  • income or loss from discontinued operations; • net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);   • pension expense related to a one-time lump sum payment to former employees; • income and loss from divested businesses;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; • reserve development related to non-operating run-off insurance business;  • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization; and • the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain.    · Commercial Insurance: Liability and Financial Lines, Property and Special Risks; Consumer Insurance: Personal Insurance – Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for Commercial Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. – Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each. Catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. We believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results. · Consumer Insurance: Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, and Life Insurance; Other Operations: Institutional Markets – Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts and mutual funds. Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 74      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Critical Accounting Estimates       Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:     · loss reserves; · reinsurance assets; · valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; · valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; · estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; · impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment; · liability for legal contingencies; · fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; and · income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax assets.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, you should read Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2016 Annual Report.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 75      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary      Executive Summary  Overview This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in our securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2016 Annual Report, in their entirety for a more detailed description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.   AIG’S OPERATING MODEL  Our Core businesses include Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, as well as Other Operations. Commercial Insurance includes two modules – Liability and Financial Lines and Property and Special Risks. Consumer Insurance is comprised of four modules – Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Personal Insurance. As we continue to focus on operating improvement, we are exiting certain lines of business and market regions that we consider non-core and unprofitable while still maintaining a global presence for our Core businesses. The Legacy Portfolio consists of our run-off insurance lines and legacy investments. Other Operations consists of businesses and items not attributed to our Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance modules or our Legacy Portfolio.  Our multinational capabilities provide a diverse mix of businesses through our global offices and branches in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions. Accordingly, we also review and assess the performance of our Core business through the broad locations of our insurance operations across three key geographic modules: the United States, Europe, and Japan. Our disclosure of geography is based on the significant legal entity insurance companies (including branches) operating in those geographic areas. The other geography includes AIG Parent, United Guaranty Corporation (United Guaranty), AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Fuji Life), our insurance operations in remaining geographies around the globe and certain legal entities not deemed significant in the key geographic areas. Geography disclosures exclude our Legacy Portfolio. On September 25, 2017, we announced prospective changes to our organizational structure, which will become effective during the fourth quarter. Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments are expected to transition to General Insurance and Life and Retirement, respectively. General Insurance and Life and Retirement will each have distinct business units that reflect how business is marketed and underwritten. General Insurance is expected to include U.S. and International results for Commercial Insurance and Personal Insurance. Life and Retirement is expected to include Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets.  Other Operations is expected to include AIG Parent and our new technology-focused subsidiary, Blackboard, formerly operating as Hamilton USA, which was acquired on October 2, 2017. Our Legacy Portfolio will continue to consist of our run-off insurance lines and legacy investments. When the new operating structure is finalized in the fourth quarter, the presentation of our segment results will be modified and prior periods’ presentation will be revised to conform to the new structure.

AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q  77      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary     Financial Performance Summary      Net Income (Loss) Attributable To AIG Three Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions)        2017 and 2016 Quarterly Comparison Decreased due to lower income from insurance operations, reflecting aggregate pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3.0 billion, which included losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the earthquake in Mexico, compared to catastrophe losses of $282 million in the same period in the prior year; an increase in unfavorable prior year loss reserve development driven by higher than expected loss emergence mainly in Liability and Financial Lines primarily related to accident year 2016; lower net investment income; and higher net realized capital losses. These decreases were partially offset by lower general operating and other expenses and a net positive adjustment from the update of actuarial assumptions compared to a net negative adjustment in the same period in the prior year.         Net Income Attributable To AIG Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions)        2017 and 2016 Year-to-Date Comparison Decreased due to lower income from insurance operations, reflecting higher catastrophe losses, an increase in unfavorable prior year loss reserve development driven by higher than expected loss emergence mainly in Liability and Financial Lines primarily related to accident year 2016, a loss on sale of divested businesses due to the sale of Fuji Life in 2017 compared to a gain on sale of divested businesses due to the sale of AIG Advisor Group Inc. (AIG Advisor Group) and NSM Insurance Group LLC (NSM) in 2016 and higher net realized capital losses. These decreases were partially offset by lower general operating and other expenses, a net positive adjustment from the update of actuarial assumptions compared to a net negative adjustment in the same period in the prior year and fair value gains on derivative positions in the Legacy Portfolio, as well as higher net investment income due to increased income from alternative investments and higher appreciation on assets for which the fair value option was elected.

In keeping with our broad and ongoing efforts to transform for long-term competitiveness, general operating and other expenses for the third quarters of 2017 and 2016 included approximately $31 million and $210 million of pre-tax restructuring and other costs, respectively, which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges.     General Operating Expenses, Operating Basis*              Nine Months Ended September 30, ($ in millions) General Operating and Other Expenses        2017 and 2016 Year-to-Date Comparison Declined due to lower employee-related expenses and professional fee reductions related to our ongoing efficiency program and divestitures of businesses, including United Guaranty, AIG Advisor Group, Fuji Life and NSM, and a favorable foreign exchange impact of $19 million. General operating and other expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 included approximately $259 million and $488 million of pre-tax restructuring and other costs, respectively, which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges. We continue to execute initiatives focused on organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization, which are expected to result in aggregate pre-tax restructuring and other costs of approximately $1.5 billion (of which approximately $1.45 billion has been recognized since the third quarter of 2015) as well as generate pre-tax annualized savings of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion when fully implemented by 2018.

AIG’s Outlook – Industry and economic factors Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first nine months of 2017, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, the Department of Labor’s (the DOL) final fiduciary duty rule (the DOL Fiduciary Rule), volatile energy markets, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the formal commencement of the United Kingdom’s (the UK) withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time. Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment Interest rates decreased marginally in the first nine months of 2017 and have remained at historically low levels. Certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities. Annuity Sales and Surrenders The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 82      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Reinvestment and Spread Management We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments. For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. For example, competitors including private equity-held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates. As a result, the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields, which could reduce our spreads and future profitability. Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 73 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at September 30, 2017. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 70 percent at both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at September 30, 2017.

Assumption Updates and Loss Recognition Spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize DAC and related reserves for investment-oriented products. If future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate DAC and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. In addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment.  See Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Update of Actuarial Assumptions for discussion of such adjustments recorded in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 in our Consumer Insurance and Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines. Commercial Insurance The impact of low interest rates on our Commercial Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. We do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 84      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    In addition, for our Commercial Insurance segment and run-off insurance lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.  Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense. Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, related exemption amendments, and subsequent interpretative guidance and bulletins. Overall, the DOL Fiduciary Rule, as currently promulgated, would result in increased compliance costs and may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. Following the extension of the applicability dates of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related exemptions announced by the DOL in April 2017, the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the DOL Fiduciary Rule became applicable on June 9, 2017, with the remaining provisions of the rule scheduled to become applicable on January 1, 2018. In late August 2017, the DOL issued a proposed rule to further extend the applicability date of all remaining elements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related exemptions from January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2019. The comment period for this proposed rule ended on September 15, 2017. The delay announced in April 2017 and the current proposed delay in the applicability of the DOL Fiduciary Rule followed a February 3, 2017 presidential memorandum that directed the DOL to review the rule and determine whether the DOL Fiduciary Rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access retirement information and financial advice. Continued uncertainties in the annuity market around the impact and implementation of this rule, including potential delays and possible modifications, have continued to significantly affect distributors, negatively impacting industry sales of annuity products, including those offered by Individual Retirement. We believe, based on our understanding of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, that we have implemented the adjustments necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of the rule. In addition to the re-examination of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, other federal and state-level authorities have also initiated efforts to evaluate standards of conduct for investment advice and to impose fiduciary duties on financial advisers who give such advice. While we cannot yet predict what impact these developments will have on our businesses, we are closely following the DOL’s ongoing review and assessment of the DOL Fiduciary Rule as well as these other federal and state-level developments. Impact of Currency Volatility Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability. Liability and Financial Lines, Property and Special Risks, International Life Insurance and Personal Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the Major Currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses:         Three Months Ended                   Nine Months Ended                     September 30,       Percentage           September 30,       Percentage         Rate for 1 USD   2017   2016       Change           2017   2016       Change         Currency:                                                 JPY   110.99   103.53       7   %       112.51   110.72       2   %     EUR   0.87   0.90       (3)   %       0.91   0.90       1   %     GBP   0.77   0.74       4   %       0.79   0.71       11   %    Unless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the Major Currencies included in the preceding table.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q  85      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    Other Industry Developments On September 7, 2017, the UK Ministry of Justice announced, a proposal to increase the Ogden rate from negative 0.75 percent to between zero and one percent. This proposal has to be passed by Parliament. We will continue to monitor the progress with this potential change. In early October 2017, a series of wildfires spread across Northern California causing significant property damage, business interruption and loss of lives. As of November 2, 2017, our preliminary estimate of the amount of pre-tax losses from these wildfires is approximately $500 million, net of reinsurance, impacting both our Commercial Insurance and Personal Insurance businesses. These losses will be reflected in our fourth quarter 2017 results. This preliminary estimate involves the exercise of considerable judgment. Due to the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate losses associated with these events will not differ from this estimate, perhaps materially.

AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q  89      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations    quarterly pre-tax income (loss) Comparison for 2017 and 2016 Pre-tax results decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to: • higher aggregate pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3.0 billion, which included losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the earthquake in Mexico, compared to catastrophe losses of $282 million in the same period in the prior year; • an increase in unfavorable prior year loss reserve development driven by higher than expected loss emergence mainly in Liability and Financial Lines primarily related to accident year 2016;  • a decrease in net investment income due to lower invested assets, lower income on our hedge fund portfolio, and blended investment yields on new investments that were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called; • an increase in net realized capital losses reflecting: – higher derivative losses from variable annuity GMWB, net of hedges, including losses from guaranteed living benefit embedded derivatives, net of hedging, primarily due to a higher net negative adjustment from updates of actuarial assumptions, movement in the non-performance or “own credit” spread adjustment (NPA), driven by tightening credit spreads and lower expected GMWB payments due to higher equity markets; and – higher impairments on investments in life settlements. Partially offset by: – foreign exchange gains in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to foreign exchange losses in the same period in the prior year due to $528 million of remeasurement losses for a short-term intercompany balance in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by: • lower general operating and other expenses reflecting strategic actions to reduce expenses; and • a net positive adjustment from the update of actuarial assumptions compared to a net negative adjustment in the same period in the prior year. year-to-date pre-tax income Comparison for 2017 and 2016 Pre-tax results decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to: • higher aggregate pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3.4 billion, which included losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the earthquake in Mexico, compared to catastrophe losses of $947 million in the same period in the prior year; • an increase in unfavorable prior year loss reserve development driven by higher than expected loss emergence mainly in Liability and Financial Lines primarily related to accident year 2016;  • a loss on sale of divested businesses due to the sale of Fuji Life in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to a gain on sale from divested businesses on the sale of AIG Advisor Group and NSM in the same period in the prior year; • an increase in net realized capital losses reflecting: – higher derivative losses from variable annuity GMWB, net of hedges, including losses from guaranteed living benefit embedded derivatives, net of hedging, primarily due to a higher net negative adjustment from updates of actuarial assumptions, movement in the NPA, driven by tightening credit spreads and lower expected GMWB payments due to higher equity markets; and – gains in the same period in the prior year on the sale of a portion of our investment in People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited and PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (collectively, our PICC Investment). Partially offset by: – foreign exchange gains in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to foreign exchange losses in the same period in the prior year due to $906 million of remeasurement losses for a short-term intercompany balance in 2016; and – lower other-than-temporary impairments. These decreases were partially offset by: • lower general operating and other expenses reflecting strategic actions to reduce expenses;  • a net positive adjustment from the update of actuarial assumptions compared to a net negative adjustment in the same period in the prior year; • higher Legacy Portfolio fair value gains on certain investments; and  • an increase in net investment income due to higher income on alternative investments, primarily in our hedge fund portfolio.       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 90      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations    Income Tax expense analysis For the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 38.9 percent. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt income and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, partially offset by tax charges related to losses in our European operations taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was not meaningful, due to a tax benefit on pre-tax income. The tax benefit was primarily due to tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement in accordance with ASU 2016-09, partially offset by tax charges related to increases in uncertain tax positions associated with the impact of settlement discussions with the IRS related to certain open tax issues and losses in our European operations taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 41.2 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to foreign exchange losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries related to the weakening of the British pound following the Brexit vote taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent, partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 34.6 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income, the impact of an agreement reached with the IRS related to certain tax issues under audit and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, partially offset by a tax charge and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions and foreign exchange losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries related to the weakening of the British pound following the Brexit vote taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent.

BUSINESS STRATEGY   Customer: We provide commercial insurance solutions to the full spectrum of enterprises — from large, multinational, and mid-sized companies to small businesses, entrepreneurs, and non-profit organizations across the globe. We  expect that investments in underwriting, claims services,  client risk services, science and data will continue to differentiate us from our peers and drive a superior client experience.  Sharpen Commercial Focus: Create a leaner, more focused, and more profitable Commercial Insurance organization. Deliver a more competitive return on equity across our businesses primarily through improvements in our loss ratio.

Exit or remediate targeted sub-segments of underperforming portfolios or non-core businesses that do not meet our risk acceptance or profitability objectives. Maintain and grow profitable accounts and deliver a better client experience. Invest to Grow: Grow our higher-value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities, continuing initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure, advancing our engineering capabilities, innovating new products and client risk solutions and delivering a better client experience.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 93      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Commercial Insurance     COMPETITION and challenges  Operating in a highly competitive industry,  Commercial Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign  insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. Commercial Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service. We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis — from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise. Our challenges include:  • information technology infrastructure modernization, which puts pressure on our efforts to reduce operating expenses;  • long-tail exposures that create added challenges to pricing and risk management; • over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;  • tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and • volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific business:  Liability and Financial Lines  The Liability and Financial Lines markets remain challenging, with excess capacity continuing to negatively impact the rate environment. Despite this, we continue to achieve rate increases in challenged areas of the portfolio, particularly for directors and officers liability (D&O) within U.S. Financial lines, and more broadly across U.S. Casualty Lines. Within U.S. Casualty, we expect continued execution of our risk selection strategy alongside disciplined underwriting to allow us to achieve rate increases through the remainder of 2017. We have continued to observe higher loss cost trends, which are impacting not only the primary books, but also having a leveraged impact on excess layers. Liability and Financial Lines has large international exposures within the Commercial Insurance portfolio and will therefore remain sensitive to volatility in foreign currencies.  Property and Special Risks  In the first nine months of 2017, Property and Special Risks experienced growth in certain of our targeted lines of business, including Middle Markets; however, we faced certain challenges in other lines driven by the competitive market environment. Rates in more commoditized lines of business such as U.S. excess and surplus continue to be unsatisfactory and we intend to continue to reduce our net premiums written in these areas. Property premiums declined in the first nine months of 2017, primarily due to reductions in the portfolio driven by actions to address accounts with inadequate prices and unfavorable terms and conditions. Overall, Property and Special Risks experienced rate pressure in the first nine months of 2017; however, recent hurricane and earthquake activity is expected to positively impact market pricing. Property and Special Risks continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint, diverse product offering, risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience.

(b) The catastrophe losses resulted from commercial auto physical damage claims related to hurricane activity in the third quarter of 2017.   Business and Financial Highlights Liability and Financial Lines pre-tax operating income decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, due to higher unfavorable prior year loss reserve development, mainly in U.S. and European Casualty and Financial Lines, primarily in accident year 2016. These decreases were partially offset by the amortization of the deferred gain from National Indemnity Company (NICO) reinsurance agreement. The decrease was also driven by higher current accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, primarily in U.S. Casualty Lines. Net premiums written decreased primarily due to continued execution of strategic portfolio optimization actions across the U.S. businesses as well as disciplined underwriting in challenging market conditions. General operating expenses continued to decrease due to expense saving initiatives.  Net investment income reflected lower interest and dividends in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, due to lower invested assets resulting from the first quarter 2017 funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, the lower net investment income was partially offset by higher income on alternative investments and gains on securities where we elected the fair value option.

This decrease was partially offset by: • lower acquisition expenses driven by lower insurance taxes, licenses and fees; and  • lower general operating expenses driven by continued strategic actions to reduce operating expenses.         Liability and Financial Lines Pre-Tax Operating Income Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  Pre-tax operating income decreased due to:  • higher unfavorable prior year loss reserve development, partially offset by the net losses ceded under the NICO reinsurance agreement and the amortization of the deferred gain from the NICO reinsurance agreement; • higher current accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, mainly in U.S. Casualty Lines, driven by an increase in loss estimates as a result of 2016 year-end and second and third quarter 2017 detailed reserve valuation reviews; and • lower net investment income reflecting lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from funding of the NICO reinsurance agreement, partially offset by higher income on alternative investments and gains on securities where we elected the fair value option.

The increase in the loss ratio was due to:  • an increase in prior year unfavorable loss reserve development largely in reaction to early unfavorable loss emergence in U.S. Casualty and Financial Lines in accident year 2016, and an increased number of large claims in European Casualty and Financial Lines primarily in accident year 2016; and  • higher current accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, in certain U.S. Casualty Lines, driven by an increase in loss estimates as a result of 2016 year-end and second and third quarter 2017 detailed reserve valuation reviews. This increase was slightly offset by a decrease in the expense ratio due to a lower general operating expense ratio that was almost entirely offset by a higher acquisition ratio.     * Excludes adjustment for ceded premiums under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years.    Liability and Financial Lines Combined Ratios Nine Months Ended September 30,        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  The increase in combined ratio reflected an increase in both the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The increase in the loss ratio was due to:  • an increase in prior year unfavorable loss reserve development largely in reaction to early unfavorable loss emergence in U.S. Casualty and Financial Lines in accident year 2016, and an increased number of large claims in European Casualty and Financial Lines primarily in accident year 2016; and  • higher current accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, in certain U.S. Casualty Lines, driven by an increase in loss estimates as a result of 2016 year-end and second and third quarter of 2017 detailed reserve valuation reviews. The increase in the expense ratio reflected a higher general operating expense ratio due to a decrease in net premiums earned reflecting portfolio optimization, which more than offset expense reductions.    * Excludes adjustment for ceded premiums under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years.

Business and Financial Highlights Property and Special Risks pre-tax operating income decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to higher catastrophe and severe losses, and an elevated current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, primarily in U.S. and Europe commercial property. Property and Special Risks net premiums written decreased mainly in U.S. and Europe commercial property and in U.S. programs due to portfolio optimization and continued challenging market conditions. The sale of our interest in the Ascot business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the changes made to our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program, specifically the large North American catastrophe reinsurance cover, also resulted in a decline in net premiums written. General operating expenses continued to decrease due to expense savings initiatives. Net investment income reflected higher year-to-date income from alternative investments and gains on securities where we elected the fair value option compared to the prior year, which was partially offset in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 by lower interest and dividends due to portfolio rebalancing.

AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 106      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance     COMPETITION and challenges  Consumer Insurance operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the U.S. and select international markets and competes against various financial services companies, including mutual funds, banks and other life and property casualty insurance companies. Competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business. Consumer Insurance remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service, multi-national capabilities and strong financial ratings. Our primary challenges include:  • a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields; • increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and increased competition for auto and homeowners’ insurance in Japan; • increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements have created uncertainty that is affecting industry growth; and • investments to upgrade our technology and underwriting processes challenge our management of general operating expenses.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific modules:  Individual Retirement  Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates. Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.  For additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our Individual Retirement business see Executive Summary – AIG’s Outlook – Industry and Economic Factors – Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment.  Individual Retirement provides products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.  For additional information on the DOL Fiduciary Rule see Executive Summary – AIG’s Outlook – Industry and Economic Factors – Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule.  Group Retirement  Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the VALIC  brand. VALIC  is a leading retirement  plan provider in the  U.S. for  K-12  schools  and school  districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for  both plan  sponsors and individual participants.  To  meet  this  challenge,  VALIC  is investing  in a  client-focused  technology  platform  to support  improved compliance  and self-service functionality. VALIC’s  service model  pairs self-service  tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.

Group Retirement provides products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.  For additional information on the DOL Fiduciary Rule see Executive Summary – AIG’s Outlook – Industry and Economic Factors – Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule.   Life Insurance  Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, as well as to supplement retirement income.  In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio has been evolving. We implemented a strategy to de-emphasize products with long-duration interest rate guarantees and placed a stronger focus on indexed universal life products.  For additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our Life Insurance business see Executive Summary – AIG’s Outlook –Industry and Economic Factors – Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment.  As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the United States, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally-enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.   Personal Insurance  The need  for full  life cycle  products and  coverage, increases in personal  wealth  accumulation,  and awareness of  insurance  protection and risk management  continue  to  support  the  growth  of the  Personal  Insurance  industry.  Personal Insurance  focuses  on group and corporate clients,  together  with  individual customers  within national markets. We expect  the demand for  multinational  cross-border  coverage  and  services to  increase due to  the  internationalization  of clients  and customers.  We believe our  global presence provides Personal Insurance  a  distinct competitive advantage. In Japan, the competition for auto insurance has intensified, in part driven by a decline in new car sales and the existence of fewer  but larger insurers.  In addition,  the overall  market size in  homeowners insurance contracted after the  duration restriction on long-term fire insurance became effective  in October 2015. In the U.S., we compete in the high net worth market  and will  continue to  expand  our  innovative  products and services to  distribution partners and  clients. Outside  of Japan  and  the U.S., Personal  Insurance  continues  to  invest selectively in  markets that we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.  Recent Developments  In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and Louisiana causing widespread flooding and property damage in various southern counties within the region. Certain business modules in our Consumer Insurance segment have operations in Houston, Texas and have been directly impacted by the storm. As of September 30, 2017, we have incurred approximately $27 million of storm-related costs. We continue to assess the full financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and its impact to our business operations.

Our insurance companies generate significant revenues from investment activities. As a result, the modules in Consumer Insurance are subject to variances in net investment income on the asset portfolios that support insurance liabilities and surplus.  For additional information on our investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested asset composition see Investments.  The Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Life Insurance modules review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for investment-oriented products, as well as other actuarial assumptions, at least annually. As a result, the pre-tax operating earnings of these businesses include adjustments to policy fees, policyholder benefits, interest credited and DAC amortization to reflect such assumption updates, which may be significant.  For the amount of adjustments recorded to reflect such assumption updates by product line and financial statement line item and for related discussion of the assumption changes that resulted in these adjustments see Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Update of Actuarial Assumptions.

As a result, deposits in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 were lower than the same periods in the prior year in most product lines. Net investment income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 included lower alternative investment income primarily due to a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, net investment income included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and higher returns from alternative investments, partially offset by a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio. Pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each period to update actuarial assumptions, particularly from updates to assumptions for lapses, spreads, and separate account long-term asset growth rate. Fixed Annuities base net investment spread decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower reinvestment yields, accretion income and commercial mortgage loan prepayments, partially mitigated by disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, base net investment spread was comparable to the same period in the prior year, as the impact of lower reinvestment yields, accretion income and prepayments on commercial mortgage loans was mostly mitigated by disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 110      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance        Individual Retirement Pre-Tax Operating Income Three Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2017 and 2016 Comparison  Pre-tax operating income decreased primarily due to:  • lower net positive adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions, which was $242 million compared to $369 million in the prior year;  • lower net investment income from alternative investments due to continued impact of the reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected; • lower base net investment spread in Fixed Annuities primarily due to lower reinvestment yields, accretion income and commercial mortgage loan prepayments, partially mitigated by disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management; • higher policyholder benefit expense primarily due to growth in Index Annuities and lower benefit expense in the prior year driven by reductions in variable annuity reserves; and • higher commission expense primarily due to growth in account values from improvements in the equity markets and an allocation of life reinsurance risk charges, as all U.S. life segments benefited from the reduction in required statutory capital resulting from a reinsurance agreement entered into in 2016 involving certain whole life, term life and universal life businesses (Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions); Partially offsetting these decreases were:  • higher policy fee and advisory fee income, net of expenses, primarily due to growth in account values from improvements in the equity markets; and  • higher base net investment spread in Variable and Index Annuities primarily due to growth in invested assets, higher commercial mortgage loan prepayments, and disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management.         AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 111      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance        Individual Retirement Pre-Tax Operating Income Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  Pre-tax operating income increased primarily due to: • net investment income, which included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and higher returns on alternative investments, partially offset by a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio; • higher base net investment spread in Variable and Index Annuities primarily due to growth in invested assets, and disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage loan prepayments and accretion income; • lower policyholder benefit expense primarily due to a reduction in immediate annuity reserves, partially offset by growth in Index Annuities and lower benefit expense in the prior year driven by reductions in variable annuity reserves; • excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption updates, lower DAC amortization primarily due to improved equity market performance; and • higher policy fee and advisory fee income, net of expenses, due to growth in annuity account values from improvement in the equity markets. Partially offsetting these increases were: • lower net positive adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions as discussed above;  • higher commission expense primarily due to growth in account values from improvements in the equity markets and the allocation of reinsurance risk charges from Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions; and • the sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016, which drove the decreases in advisory fee income, advisory expenses and general operating expenses, and resulted in a net $14 million decrease in pre-tax operating income.       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 112      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance      Individual Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Individual Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to stronger sales of immediate annuities in the prior-year periods, in which higher equity market volatility made immediate annuities more attractive to customers seeking less volatile returns.  Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds under administration.  Net flows for annuity products in Individual Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals.

For Variable and Index Annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charges at September 30, 2017 has decreased compared to December 31, 2016 due to normal aging of the business and slower sales, which were due in part to uncertainty around the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. The increase in reserves with no surrender charge contributed to the increase in the surrender rate in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in the prior year.       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 113      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance     A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows:    Individual Retirement Premiums and Deposits (P&D) and Net Flows Three Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2017 and 2016 Comparison  • Fixed Annuities premiums and deposits were slightly higher than the prior-year period primarily due to strategic crediting rate enhancements for certain products. Net flows continued to be negative but improved compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to lower surrenders, in addition to higher premiums and deposits. • Variable and Index Annuities premiums and deposits and net flows declined, primarily due to lower sales of variable annuities, due in part to continued uncertainty in the annuity market around the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. Lower sales combined with higher surrenders compared to the prior-year period resulted in lower net flows. • Retail Mutual Funds had negative net flows in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to positive net flows in the same period in the prior year, reflecting lower deposits due to negative industry trends in U.S. equity actively managed funds and uncertainty surrounding the DOL Fiduciary Rule.         Individual Retirement Premiums and Deposits (P&D) and Net Flows Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  • Fixed Annuities premiums and deposits were lower than the prior-year period, and net flows continued to be negative, primarily due to disciplined pricing in the continued low interest rate environment and higher equity market volatility in the prior-year period, which made fixed annuities more attractive to customers seeking less volatile returns.  • Variable and Index Annuities premiums and deposits and net flows declined, reflecting lower sales of index annuities, along with a continued decrease in variable annuity industry sales due in part to uncertainty around the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. Lower sales combined with higher surrenders compared to the prior-year period resulted in a decrease in net flows for the index annuity product line and negative net flows compared to positive net flows in the prior-year period for the variable annuity product line. • Retail Mutual Funds had negative net flows in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to positive net flows in the same period in the prior year, reflecting lower deposits due to negative industry trends in U.S. equity actively managed funds and uncertainty surrounding the DOL Fiduciary Rule.

The increase in premiums and deposits was primarily driven by higher deposits from group acquisitions, which, along with lower surrenders, drove the improvement in net flows in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017. Net flows in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 declined and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders reflecting continued pressure from the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in our target markets.  Low base net investment yields and lower commercial mortgage loan prepayments in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 continued to pressure investment spreads, partially mitigated by crediting rate management. Net investment income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 included lower alternative investment income primarily due to a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, net investment income included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and higher returns from alternative investments, partially offset by a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio. Pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each period to update actuarial assumptions, particularly from updates to separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption.

Partially offsetting these increases were:  • lower base net investment spread primarily due to lower reinvestment yields and commercial mortgage loan prepayments, partially mitigated by effective crediting rate management;  • lower net investment income from alternative investments due to continued impact of the reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio; and  • higher commission expense primarily due to the allocation of reinsurance risk charges from Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions.         Group Retirement Pre-Tax Operating Income Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  Pre-tax operating income increased primarily due to: • a net positive adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions compared to a net negative adjustment in the prior year as discussed above; • net investment income, which included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and higher returns on alternative investments, partially offset by a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio;  • higher policy fee income due to growth in account values from improvement in the equity markets; and • lower general operating expenses primarily due to lower legal expenses, partially offset by higher spending for implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. Partially offsetting these increases were: • lower base net investment spread primarily due to lower reinvestment yields and commercial mortgage loan prepayments, partially mitigated by effective crediting rate management; and  • higher commission expense primarily due to the allocation of reinsurance risk charges from Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions.

Premiums in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, which primarily represent immediate annuities, were comparable to the same periods in the prior year.  Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds under administration.   Net flows for annuity products included in Group Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals.

(b) Group Retirement amounts in this category include reserves of approximately $6.3 billion, at both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which are subject to 20 percent annual withdrawal limitations. Group Retirement annuities are typically subject to a five- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. The increase in the amount and proportion of Group Retirement annuity reserves that have no surrender charge at September 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to normal aging of this book of business, withdrawal limitations on certain plan assets and lower than expected surrenders of older contracts with higher minimum interest rates on fixed account balances that have continued to be attractive to the contract holders in the low interest rate environment.

Life Insurance is focused on selling profitable new products through strategic channels to enhance future returns. General operating expenses decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the strategic decision to refocus the group benefits business. Pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each period to update actuarial assumptions, which was a net positive adjustment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 compared to a net negative adjustment in the same periods in the prior year.

Partially offsetting these increases was lower net investment income from alternative investments due to continued impact of the reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio and lower income from yield enhancements, partially offset by higher commercial mortgage loan prepayments.

AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 120      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance      Life Insurance GAAP Premiums and Premiums and Deposits Premiums for Life Insurance represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, primarily term life, and group benefit policies. Premiums increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily due to assumed premiums related to business distributed by Laya Healthcare and growth in term life and international life and health, partially offset by lower premiums on group benefits policies. Premiums and deposits for Life Insurance is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance. The following table presents a reconciliation of Life Insurance premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended         September 30,       September 30,     (in millions)       2017       2016           2017       2016     Premiums   $   384   $   349       $   1,168   $   1,068     Deposits       371       355           1,120       1,050     Other       180       176           504       490     Premiums and deposits   $   935   $   880       $   2,792   $   2,608    A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits follows:    Life Insurance Premiums and Deposits  Three Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Premiums and deposits grew by six percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, principally driven by assumed premiums related to business distributed by Laya Healthcare and growth in universal life, term life and international life and health, partially offset by lower premiums on group benefits policies.         Life Insurance Premiums and Deposits  Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Premiums and deposits grew by eight percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, principally driven by assumed premiums related to business distributed by Laya Healthcare and growth in universal life, term life and international life and health, partially offset by lower premiums on group benefits policies.

This presentation follows our geography modules. For further discussion on our geography modules see MD&A – Executive Summary.  (b) Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each. Catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. (c) Flooding events reported in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 are a subset of windstorm events.

Business and Financial Highlights Personal Insurance operating results decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016, driven by multiple catastrophe events in the current quarter. Personal Insurance continued its execution of strategic and portfolio actions while implementing underwriting actions and maintaining pricing discipline. Although market competition in the Personal Insurance industry has intensified, the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, continued to reflect the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of short-tailed risk in our Personal Insurance book.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 123      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Consumer Insurance        Personal Insurance Pre-Tax Operating Income (Loss) Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions)        Quarterly 2017 and 2016 Comparison  Pre-tax operating income decreased due to:  • higher catastrophe losses driven by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as other catastrophes including the recent Mexico earthquake; and • lower net favorable prior year loss reserve development. Partially offsetting these decreases were: • lower accident year losses; and • higher net investment income from alternative investments partially offset by lower interest and dividends due to portfolio rebalancing.          Personal Insurance Pre-Tax Operating Income Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  Pre-tax operating income decreased due to:  • higher catastrophe losses;  • a lower earned premium base; and • lower net favorable prior year loss reserve development. Partially offsetting these decreases were: • lower accident year losses;  • strategic actions to reduce expenses; and • higher net investment income on alternative investments.

These decreases were partially offset by higher production growth in the AIG private client group business, Accident and Health, and warranty service programs.         Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison Net premiums written decreased, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflecting the following: • decreased production in Accident and Health including increased reinsurance purchases on certain blocks of business to manage aggregate exposure; • lower automobile and personal property production in our Japan business; and  • higher ceded premiums due to the lower attachment point and the additional layer of coverage on our catastrophe reinsurance programs.  These decreases were partially offset by production growth in the AIG private client group business.

The higher loss ratio was driven by: • higher losses arising from multiple catastrophe events; and • lower net favorable prior year loss reserve development.  The loss ratio increase was partially offset by improved accident year losses. The expense ratio remained flat due to a higher general operating expense ratio almost entirely offset by a lower acquisition ratio.           Personal Insurance Combined Ratios Nine Months Ended September 30,        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison  The increase in combined ratio reflected a higher loss ratio, partially offset by improvement in expense ratio.  The increase in loss ratio was driven by: • higher catastrophe losses; and • lower net favorable prior year loss reserve development.  The loss ratio increase was partially offset by improved accident year losses. The improvement in expense ratio reflected continued strategic actions to reduce expenses.

Institutional Markets pre-tax operating income increased due to favorable mortality experience. Parent and Other pre-tax operating loss was flat compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher gains on securities where we elected the fair value option, offset by higher corporate general operating expenses.  year-to-date 2017 and 2016 Comparison Pre-tax operating loss increased primarily due to the sale of United Guaranty during the fourth quarter of 2016.  Institutional Markets pre-tax operating income increased due to higher net spreads driven by growth in business. Parent and Other pre-tax operating loss decreased as a result of gains on securities where we elected the fair value option, partially offset by higher general operating expenses related to one time payments for recent executive leadership changes.  Fuji Life pre-tax operating results increased primarily as a result of increases in underwriting income as a result of new products launched during 2016 as well as growth within existing product lines. Fuji Life was sold on April 30, 2017.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 127      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Legacy Portfolio      Legacy Portfolio          Legacy Insurance Lines represent exited or discontinued product lines, policy forms or distribution channels. Legacy Property and Casualty Run-Off Insurance Lines — consists of asbestos and environmental exposures and other exposures within certain Property and Casualty profit centers no longer written, including excess workers’ compensation, environmental impairment liability, public entity liability, accident & health, physicians and surgeons professional liability, and various other workers’ compensation and general liability exposures. Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines — include whole life, long term care and exited accident & health product lines. Also includes certain structured settlement, terminal funding and single premium immediate annuities written prior to April 2012. Legacy Investments — include investment classes that we have placed into run-off (life settlements, Legacy Global Real Estate and the Direct Investment book) and equity-like securities with high yield, high-risk characteristics.  BUSINESS STRATEGY   For Legacy Insurance Lines, securing the interests of our policyholders and insureds is paramount. We have considered and continue to evaluate the following strategies for these lines: • Third party and affiliated reinsurance and retrocessions to improve capital efficiency • Commutations of assumed reinsurance and direct policy buy-backs • Enhance insured policyholder options and claims resolution strategies • Enhanced asset liability management and expense management For Legacy Investments, our business strategy is to maximize liquidity to AIG Parent and minimize book value impairments while sourcing for our insurance companies attractive assets for their portfolios. Where the asset is under our sole control, we expect to achieve this through a combination of unaffiliated and affiliated sales and securitizations. Where the asset is not under our sole control, there are fewer options as we may, for example, have fiduciary duty obligations to joint venture partners (such as in our Legacy Global Real Estate book).

The majority of the consideration received was used to pay down intercompany loans and notes with affiliated insurance companies. In addition, the Legacy Investment portfolio returned approximately $1.0 billion of cash proceeds to AIG Parent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, including $191 million from the sale of an AIG-sponsored fund that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.  On September 26, 2017, we signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell the remaining life settlements contracts. The sale was completed on November 1, 2017. As a result, an impairment charge of $273 million was recorded in net realized capital losses in the third quarter of 2017 to write down the contracts to their fair market value.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 129      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Legacy Portfolio       Legacy Portfolio Pre-Tax Operating Income (Loss)  Three Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Quarterly 2017 and 2016 Comparison Pre-tax operating income increased due to higher Legacy Life pre-tax operating income due to significantly lower loss recognition on certain payout annuities from the update of actuarial assumptions in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. Partially offsetting the increase was lower Legacy Investment pre-tax operating income driven primarily by lower gains on portfolios for which the fair value option was elected, and lower income on the life settlements portfolio as a result of partial sales.     Legacy Portfolio Pre-Tax Operating Income (Loss)  Nine Months Ended September 30,  (in millions)        Year-to-Date 2017 and 2016 Comparison Pre-tax operating income increased due to:  • significantly lower loss recognition on certain payout annuities from the update of actuarial assumptions in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year; • increased Legacy Investment pre-tax operating income in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher fair value gains on portfolios for which the fair value option was elected; and • increased Legacy Property and Casualty pre-tax operating income due to unfavorable prior year development in the prior year.       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 130      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments      Investments  Overview Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business modules and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.    Investment Highlights during the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017     • A decrease in interest rates and narrowing credit spreads resulted in a net unrealized gain in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $14.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 from approximately $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2016. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • During the first quarter of 2017, we funded the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO. The approximate $10.2 billion funding of this agreement was the primary reason for the decrease in the invested asset portfolio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. • During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately $1.8 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. Our hedge fund portfolio experienced above average returns in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 due to higher equity market performance. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  • Other-than-temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our structured securities and corporate bond portfolios. • During the second quarter of 2017, partial sale of our investment in Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Arch), which we received as part of the consideration for selling United Guaranty to Arch in 2016.     Investment Strategies  Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Property Casualty Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Property Casualty Insurance Companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  • While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.  • AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 131      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    The following table presents the components of Net Investment Income:            Three Months Ended           Nine Months Ended             September 30,           September 30,     (in millions)       2017       2016           2017       2016     Interest and dividends   $   2,960   $   3,213       $   9,037   $   9,698     Alternative investments(a)       355       365           1,174       309     Other investment income(b)       237       320           894       810     Total investment income       3,552       3,898           11,105       10,817     Investment expenses       136       115           390       338     Total net investment income   $   3,416   $   3,783       $   10,715   $   10,479    (a) Includes income from hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships. Hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date. Other hedge funds are generally reported on a one-month lag, while private equity funds are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. (b) Primarily includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and income on life settlements. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $138 million and $98 million, respectively, and on life settlements was $55 million and $161 million, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $479 million and $370 million, respectively, and on life settlements was $256 million and $360 million, respectively.  Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 was lower than the same period in the prior year due to lower invested assets, lower income on our hedge fund portfolio, and blended investment yields on new investments that were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called partially offset by higher gains on assets for which we elected the fair value option. Net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 was higher than the same period in the prior year as higher income on our alternative investments, primarily in our hedge fund portfolio, and higher gains on assets for which we elected the fair value option, more than offset lower invested assets and blended investment yields on new investments that were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called. Attribution of Net Investment Income to Operating Modules Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses. For Commercial Insurance — Liability and Financial Lines, Property and Special Risks and Consumer Insurance — Personal Insurance and Legacy Property Casualty Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies to modules is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each module. For Consumer Insurance — Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, and Life Insurance, Other Operations — Institutional Markets and Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life Insurance Companies. All invested assets of the Life Insurance Companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each module. Asset Liability Measurement For the Property Casualty Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Property Casualty Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The Property Casualty Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, the Property Casualty Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 132      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    Fixed maturity securities of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.1 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the Property Casualty Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.4 years. The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life Insurance Companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.  The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies, we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.2 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 20.6 years. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade.  The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.  For a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings see Investments – Credit Ratings.

Credit Ratings At September 30, 2017, approximately 91 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2017, approximately 23 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 39 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 134      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    Composite AIG Credit Ratings With respect to our fixed maturity securities, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity securities), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments To determine other-than-temporary impairments, we use fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 141      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $147 million and $187 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $523 million and $645 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary. Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $4.4 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, due primarily to a decrease in rates and a narrowing of credit spreads.

Net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 were higher than the net realized capital losses in the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher hedge accounting losses, higher impairments on investments in life settlements, and lower gains on the sales of securities, which more than offset foreign exchange gains versus losses in the prior year. Net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 were primarily related to hedge accounting losses and impairments. Net realized capital losses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher hedge accounting losses and lower gains on the sales of securities, which more than offset foreign exchange gains versus losses in the prior year and lower other-than-temporary impairments. Net realized capital losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 consisted primarily of hedge accounting losses and impairments, which were partially offset by gains on the sales of securities and foreign exchange gains.  Derivative and hedge accounting losses were primarily a result of the fair value changes in derivative instruments used to economically hedge market risk from variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), which were impacted by interest rates and equity market performance in the first nine months of 2017, and changes in actuarial assumptions in our variable annuity program.  For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs in the 2016 Annual Report. For more information on the economic hedging target and the impact to pre-tax income of this program see Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results in this MD&A. Net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 were primarily due to foreign exchange losses related to British pound weakening following the Brexit vote, hedge accounting losses, and other-than-temporary-impairment charges, which more than offset gains on the sale of securities. Net realized capital losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were primarily related to foreign exchange losses and impairments, which were higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were primarily due to $528 million and $906 million of remeasurement losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, for a short term intercompany balance that was matched with available for sale investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in the same foreign currencies.

Consistent with our definition of PTOI, the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 exclude the portion of unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under the NICO reinsurance agreement of $3 million and $287 million, respectively, and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain of $13 million and $30 million, respectively. Net Loss Development In the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $836 million. This unfavorable development was primarily a result of the following:  • Higher than expected losses for European Casualty and Financial Lines – We observed a significant increase in large claims activity in our European long-tail business, primarily emanating from accident years 2015 and 2016; • Unfavorable development in U.S. Other Casualty – Commercial auto loss experience for accident year 2016 has been emerging higher than expected, driven by an increase in the frequency of large claims. While we observed this trend in loss severity for several quarters, the rate of growth continues to exceed our revised expectations. We have similarly strengthened our estimate for primary general liability in consideration of similar underlying severity trends; • Unfavorable development in U.S. Excess Casualty – This was driven by emerging loss experience in accident year 2016. The loss frequency and severity to date has exceeded initial expectations and is coinciding with increased loss severity in the underlying primary auto and general liability segments;  • Higher than expected losses in Property and Special Risks – We have observed unfavorable results in U.S. programs commercial auto business in accident years 2015 and 2016 primarily from terminated programs, along with some individual severe loss experience in aviation and surety. This was partially offset by favorable development in commercial property. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $902 million, primarily due to the impact of the factors noted above in the third quarter. In addition, during the second quarter we observed unfavorable claim experience in the U.S. primary general liability and U.S. excess casualty segments, notably due to construction defects and multi-year construction projects that cover all contractors on the site (“wrap business”). The majority of this activity came from accident years 2015 and prior, including a significant proportion from accident years 2006 and prior. We also observed higher than expected losses in property and special risks driven by unexpected development on several large international claims including aviation, marine and trade credit primarily from accident year 2016. In addition, in the first quarter of 2017, we increased our loss reserves by $102 million as a result of the decision made by the UK Ministry of Justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump-sum bodily injury payouts, known as the Ogden rate, to negative 0.75 percent. Our carried reserves at December 31, 2016 were estimated using our assumption that the Ogden rate would decline to 1.0 percent. This discount rate change primarily impacted the Europe casualty and financial lines.  These prior year loss reserve increases were partially offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO of $62 million and $165 million in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Our analyses and conclusions about prior year reserves also help inform our judgments about the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratios we select. We increased our selections in the second and third quarter resulting in approximately $188 million and $212 million increase in net losses incurred in the three- and nine month periods ended September, 30 2017.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 145      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $274 million and $214 million, respectively, primarily in U.S. programs business and U.S. worker’s compensation. The U.S. programs unfavorable prior year development was driven by higher than expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year emanating from terminated programs. The increase in our U.S. workers’ compensation loss reserves of approximately $100 million resulted from two separate rulings issued by the Florida Supreme Court that increased the potential liability for workers’ compensation claims in that state by reversing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003. Also in the second quarter of 2016, the Florida Court of Appeals issued the Miles decision, declaring unconstitutional certain restrictions on claimant-paid attorney fees. We are continuing to monitor the impact of these decisions and may adjust our estimate as new facts and data emerge. This development was partially offset by favorable development from U.S. property, excluding catastrophes, and consumer personal insurance.  The following tables summarize incurred (favorable) or unfavorable prior year development net of reinsurance, by accident year groupings:    Three Months Ended September 30, 2017                                             (in millions)       Total       2016       2015-2011       2010-2006       2005 & Prior     Liability and Financial Lines   $   760   $   666   $   21   $   28   $   45     Property and Special Risks       77       31       19       5       22     Consumer Personal Insurance       -       8       (6)       -       (2)     Legacy Portfolio - Property and Casualty Run-off                                             Insurance Lines       (1)       -       -       (15)       14     Total   $   836   $   705   $   34   $   18   $   79                                                   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016                                             (in millions)       Total       2015       2014-2011       2010-2006       2005 & Prior     Liability and Financial Lines   $   (5)   $   1   $   (38)   $   36   $   (4)     Property and Special Risks       322       100       223       (12)       11     Consumer Personal Insurance       (33)       (18)       (14)       1       (2)     Legacy Portfolio - Property and Casualty Run-off                                             Insurance Lines       6       -       -       -       6     Other Operations       (16)       (5)       (3)       (7)       (1)     Total   $   274   $   78   $   168   $   18   $   10                                                   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017                                             (in millions)       Total       2016       2015-2011       2010-2006       2005 & Prior     Liability and Financial Lines   $   839   $   681   $   (8)   $   60   $   106     Property and Special Risks       83       49       (2)       3       33     Consumer Personal Insurance       (3)       (15)       (2)       12       2     Legacy Portfolio - Property and Casualty Run-off                                             Insurance Lines       (17)       29       (26)       (27)       7     Total   $   902   $   744   $   (38)   $   48   $   148                                                   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016                                             (in millions)       Total       2015       2014-2011       2010-2006       2005 & Prior     Liability and Financial Lines   $   69   $   20   $   (61)   $   99   $   11     Property and Special Risks       268       (25)       309       (9)       (7)     Consumer Personal Insurance       (120)       (42)       (71)       (1)       (6)     Legacy Portfolio - Property and Casualty Run-off                                             Insurance Lines       31       -       -       11       20     Other Operations       (34)       (9)       (17)       (7)       (1)     Total   $   214   $   (56)   $   160   $   93   $   17    For certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above. This may affect the comparability of the data presented in our tables.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 146      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     Significant Reinsurance Agreements Effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a two-year reinsurance arrangement with the Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, under which we ceded a proportional share of our new and renewal U.S. Casualty portfolio in order to reduce the concentration of casualty business in our portfolio. Our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses and Japan cover to protect against losses in Japan. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is $1.5 billion for North America losses (down from $3.0 billion in 2016) and varies for the Japan cover, and through September 8, 2017 provided up to $3.2 billion of coverage on a per event basis, with approximately $525 million of coverage provided via reinsurance purchased from catastrophe bond issuers. Effective September 8, 2017, we added approximately an additional $1.3 billion of coverage to the North American cover, making our total coverage $4.5 billion for the remainder of 2017.  In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire, under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. At NICO’s 80 percent share, NICO’s limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion. The covered losses ceded to NICO were $13.1 billion and the unexpired limit was $6.9 billion at September 30, 2017. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. We paid total consideration, including interest, of $10.2 billion. The consideration was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations, and Berkshire has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of NICO under the agreement. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred.

(b) Represents amortization of the deferred gain recognized in PTOI. The lines of business subject to this agreement have been the source of substantially all of the prior year adverse development charges over the past several years. The agreement resulted in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Under U.S. GAAP, any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred; however, the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period. However, consistent with our definition of PTOI, we exclude the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain. In addition, amortization of the deferred gain is recognized in PTOI based on the original amortization schedule at the time we entered into the agreement. For a summary of significant reinsurers see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Reinsurance Activities – Reinsurance Recoverable in our 2016 Annual Report.  LIFE AND ANNUITY reserves and dac The following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs. Update of Actuarial Assumptions The Life Insurance Companies review and update estimated gross profit projections used to amortize DAC and related items for investment-oriented products at least annually. Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.  The Life Insurance Companies also review assumptions related to their respective GMWB living benefits which are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions. Various assumptions were updated, including the following effective September 30, 2017:  • we reduced our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance by 50 basis points to 7.0 percent and increased our reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) to 3.74 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Group Retirement; and • we lowered our ultimate projected yields on invested assets by approximately five to 10 basis points. Projected yields are graded from a weighted average net GAAP book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the asset to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period. The grading period is three years for annuity products and five years for life insurance products.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 148      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     For long-duration traditional products, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. Underlying assumptions are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate. The net increases (decreases) to pre-tax operating income and pre-tax income as a result of the update of actuarial assumptions for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the following tables. The following table presents the increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income resulting from the update of actuarial assumptions for the domestic life insurance companies, by segment and product line:    Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30,                     (in millions)       2017       2016     Consumer Insurance:                     Individual Retirement                     Fixed Annuities   $   130   $   330     Variable and Indexed Annuities       112       39     Total Individual Retirement       242       369     Group Retirement       13       (47)     Life Insurance       29       (92)     Total Consumer Insurance       284       230     Other:                     Institutional Markets       -       -     Legacy Life Run-off       (14)       (614)     Total increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income from update of assumptions   $   270   $   (384)    The following table presents the increase (decrease) in pre-tax income resulting from the update of actuarial assumptions in the domestic life insurance companies, by line item as reported in Results of Operations:    Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30,                     (in millions)       2017       2016     Policy fees   $   (2)   $   (54)     Interest credited to policyholder account balances       49       65     Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       184       325     Policyholder benefits and losses incurred       39       (720)     Increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income       270       (384)     Change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses)       44       13     Net realized capital gains (losses)       (246)       (56)     Increase (decrease) in pre-tax income   $   68   $   (427)    In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, pre-tax operating income included a net positive adjustment of $270 million, primarily driven by lower lapse assumptions in Fixed Annuities, improved mortality assumptions in Life Insurance, and an increase in the reversion to the mean rates in Variable Annuities. The positive adjustments were partially offset by lower spread assumptions in Fixed Annuities and a loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, pre-tax operating income included a net negative adjustment of $384 million, primarily driven by $622 million of loss recognition reserves for pre-2010 payout annuities in the Legacy Portfolio, and an increase in Life Insurance reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees. These negative adjustments were partially offset by positive adjustments, primarily due to lower lapse assumptions in Fixed Annuities.  The adjustments related to the update of actuarial assumptions in each period are discussed by business module below.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 149      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     Update of Actuarial Assumptions by Business Module Individual Retirement The update of actuarial assumptions resulted in net positive adjustments to pre-tax operating income of Individual Retirement of $242 million and $369 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In Fixed Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $130 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, which reflected lower lapse assumptions, partially offset by lower spread assumptions. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, a net positive adjustment of $330 million reflected lower lapse assumptions, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates, as well as updates to spread assumptions. In Variable and Index Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $112 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in volatility assumptions. The net positive adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and a negative adjustment in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for Index Annuities.  In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $39 million primarily due to favorable updates to assumptions for volatility, lapses, mortality and policy expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The net positive adjustment included a net negative adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion.  Group Retirement In Group Retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $13 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in maintenance expense assumptions. The net positive adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and decreases in fixed annuity spread and separate account fee assumptions. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, a net negative adjustment of $47 million was primarily due to refinements in lapse and partial withdrawal assumptions and a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected).  Life Insurance In Life Insurance, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $29 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to improved mortality assumptions, partially offset by lower spread assumptions. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, a net negative adjustment of $92 million was primarily due to refinement to reserves for universal life insurance with secondary guarantees due to lower assumed surrender rates. The update to Life Insurance assumptions in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 also included lower spread assumptions. Legacy Portfolio The update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $14 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to $13 million of loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines resulting from model enhancements.  The update of actuarial assumptions resulted in $622 million of loss recognition expense in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 on payout annuities in the Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines. The loss recognition reflected the establishment of additional reserves primarily as a result of mortality experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten prior to 2010.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 150      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. The liabilities for GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors. In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.  For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs in our 2016 Annual Report.  Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following: • The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero; • The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and • The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life Insurance Companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include: • Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative; • Realized volatility versus implied volatility;  • Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and • Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge. The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:                                September 30,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2017       2016     Reconciliation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target:                                         Embedded derivative liability                       $   2,104   $   1,777     Exclude non-performance risk adjustment                           (2,425)       (3,148)     Embedded derivative liability, excluding NPA                           4,529       4,925     Adjustments for risk margins and differences in valuation                           (1,904)       (2,251)     Economic hedge target liability                       $   2,625   $   2,674      AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 151      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves      Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss) The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from pre-tax operating income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits. The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended         September 30,       September 30,     (in millions)       2017       2016           2017       2016*     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial                                         assumptions and NPA   $   284   $   25       $   856   $   (2,502)     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio:                                         Fixed maturity securities       26       17           117       270     Interest rate derivative contracts       (20)       27           10       1,411     Equity derivative contracts       (310)       (350)           (978)       (650)     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio       (304)       (306)           (851)       1,031     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives excluding update of actuarial assumptions                                         and NPA, net of hedging portfolio        (20)       (281)           5       (1,471)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to NPA spread       (82)       (68)           (485)       55     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to change in NPA volume       (114)       158           (238)       1,305     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to update of actuarial assumptions       (188)       (101)           (188)       (101)     Total change due to update of actuarial assumptions and NPA       (384)       (11)           (911)       1,259     Net impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   (404)   $   (292)       $   (906)   $   (212)    * The change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA includes revisions for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 from $(1,116) million to $(1,586) million and June 30, 2016 from $(885) million to $(941) million. The change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, net of hedging portfolio includes revisions for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 from $(270) million to $(740) million and June 30, 2016 from $(394) million to $(450) million. The change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to change in NPA volume includes revisions for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 from $203 million to $673 million and June 30, 2016 from $418 million to $474 million. The total change due to update of actuarial assumptions and NPA includes revisions for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 from $358 million to $828 million and June 30, 2016 from $386 million to $442 million. These changes had no impact on pre-tax income (loss) and are not considered material to previously issued financial statements.  The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and volatility assumptions, tightening credit spreads on the NPA spread and the impact on the NPA (volume) of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher equity markets. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and mortality assumptions and changes in interest rates, partially offset by the impact on the NPA (volume) of higher expected GMWB claims. The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 was substantially offset by the related hedging portfolio. However, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the change in fair value of the hedging portfolio were more than offset by losses from the change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, primarily due to changes in interest rates, which impacted the embedded derivative liability excluding NPA more than the related impact to the hedging portfolio. Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis, due to the NPA and other risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 152      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     Change in Economic Hedge Target The slight decrease in the economic hedge target liability at September 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to positive equity markets and increases in market interest rates, partially offset by tighter credit spreads and lower equity volatility. Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivatives, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio: • Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 reflected gains primarily due to tightening of credit spreads, while the nine-months period ended September 30, 2016 reflected higher gains primarily due to decreases in market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the hedging bonds in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were not significant. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the pre-tax operating income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in a loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 and smaller net gain in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to significant gains from interest rate declines in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The change in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was not significant. • The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, based on the relative change in equity market performance in the respective periods. DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC, including VOBA, within the life insurance companies, excluding DAC of Institutional Markets and Legacy Portfolio:     Nine Months Ended September 30,                     (in millions)       2017       2016     Balance, beginning of year   $   7,543   $   7,149     Acquisition costs deferred       693       782     Amortization expense:                     Update of assumptions included in pre-tax operating income       194       315     Related to realized capital gains and losses       190       5     All other operating amortization       (649)       (699)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange       49       (28)     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments       (494)       (948)     Other       -       -     Balance, end of period*   $   7,526   $   6,576    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $8.8 billion and $8.1 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 153      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). Shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC balance when market interest rates decline. Market interest rates decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. As a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the Life Insurance Companies that support the businesses at September 30, 2017 increased by $3.6 billion compared to December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in DAC to reflect the shadow DAC adjustment.

Resources       Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six-months under a liquidity stress scenario.  For additional information see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement in the 2016 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below.  Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources, as was the case in 2008. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 156      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ACTIVITY FOR the NINE-month period ended SEPTEMBER 30, 2017  Sources  AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, AIG Parent received $1.6 billion in dividends from subsidiaries. Of this amount, $350 million was dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Property Casualty Insurance Companies, $1.3 billion was dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies and $2 million was cash dividends from AIG Federal Savings Bank.  AIG Parent also received $3.4 billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, including $309 million of such payments in the third quarter of 2017. The tax sharing payments may be subject to adjustment in future periods. The dividends, loan repayments and tax sharing payments from our Life Insurance Companies resulted from and were funded, in part, by excess statutory capital released by Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions. For information regarding the Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions, see Business Segment Operations — Consumer Insurance. Debt Issuance In June 2017, we issued €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount ($1.1 billion at closing) of 1.875% Notes Due 2027. Legacy Investments During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, we generated approximately $1.0 billion in return of capital from Legacy Investments. Arch In June 2017, AIG Parent and National Union received gross proceeds of approximately $391 million and $261 million, respectively, from the sale of approximately four million and three million shares, respectively, of common stock of Arch Capital Group Ltd. by means of an underwritten public offering.  Uses  Debt Reduction On July 17, 2017, we redeemed $290 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 4.90% Callable Notes Due July 17, 2045.  On September 25, 2017, we redeemed $420 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 4.90% Callable Notes Due September 25, 2045. We also made other repurchases of and repayments on debt instruments of approximately $2.1 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $789 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. Dividend We paid a cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock during each of the first, second and third quarters of 2017 totaling $885 million.  Repurchase of Common Stock We repurchased approximately 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.3 billion.

The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $1.0 billion in both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. Excluding interest payments, AIG had operating cash outflows of $8.2 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to positive operating cash of $2.8 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The operating cash outflow in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to payment for the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 158      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Investing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash provided by investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 was $14.8 billion compared to investing cash inflows of $325 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 included sales of certain investments to fund the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO. Financing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash used in financing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 included: • approximately $884 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2017; • approximately $6.3 billion to repurchase approximately 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $346 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 included: • approximately $1.1 billion in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2016; • approximately $8.5 billion to repurchase approximately 153 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and  • $263 million to repurchase 15 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock. These items were partially offset by approximately $3.7 billion in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries AIG Parent As of September 30, 2017, AIG Parent had approximately $11.2 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales, repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management. In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 159      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   September 30, 2017   December 31, 2016     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   2,184   $   3,950     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       4,560       4,470     Total AIG Parent liquidity       6,744       8,420     Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(c)       4,500       4,500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   11,244   $   12,920    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. (c) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility see Credit Facilities below.  Insurance Companies We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investments and collateral requirements. Our Property Casualty Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. On January 20, 2017, certain of our Property Casualty Insurance Companies entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO under which they transferred to NICO 80 percent of reserve risk on substantially all of their U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, these Property Casualty Insurance Companies ceded to NICO 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. The total consideration paid, including interest, was $10.2 billion. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, as we saw in 2008, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. Property Casualty Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of approximately $556 million and $733 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The outstanding borrowings are being used primarily for interest rate risk management purposes in connection with certain reinsurance arrangements, and the related balances are expected to decline as underlying premiums are collected. Our U.S. Life Insurance Companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from the FHLBs at September 30, 2017, and aggregate borrowings in the form of cash advances of approximately $2 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, $606 million and $429 million were due to the FHLB of Dallas at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, under funding agreements issued by our Institutional Markets business, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 160      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Certain of our U.S. Life Insurance Companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life Insurance Companies had $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion of securities subject to these agreements at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. AIG Parent is party to a CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of AGC Life Insurance Company at or above a specified minimum percentage of its projected NAIC Company Action Level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). As of September 30, 2017, the specified minimum percentage under this CMA was 250 percent.  During 2016, we created a new Switzerland-domiciled international holding company, AIG International Holdings, GmbH (AIGIH), which is intended to be the ultimate holding company for all of our international entities. This international holding company structure is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify our organizational structure, and is expected to facilitate the optimization of our international capital strategy from both a regulatory and tax perspective. Through November 2, 2017, the following international operations have been transferred to AIGIH: Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, our Property Casualty Insurance Companies paid approximately $350 million in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. government and government-sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, the Life Insurance Companies collectively declared a total of $2.1 billion of dividends, return of capital and loan repayments. Of this amount, $867 million was paid in the form of cash, $387 million was paid in the form of fixed maturity securities, and $890 million was retained at an intermediate life insurance holding company to fund tax sharing payments to AIG Parent. The Life Insurance Companies made tax sharing payments to AIG Parent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 totaling $3.2 billion in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities, primarily as a result of the Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions. Fixed maturity securities used to fund dividends and tax sharing payments included U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. Credit Facilities We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2022. As of September 30, 2017, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

(b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.6 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Loss Reserves Loss reserves relate to our Property Casualty Insurance Companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our Property Casualty Insurance Companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life Insurance Companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life Insurance Companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life Insurance Companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 162      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Borrowings Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. For further information on indemnification obligations see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Includes a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $500 million between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility) scheduled to mature in May 2019. The AerCap Credit Facility permits loans for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 163      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     (f) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. There is no remaining annual pension contribution for 2017 for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities  We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.  For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

(d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.

Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock  On February 14, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on March 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2017. On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on June 28, 2017 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2017. On August 2, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on September 29, 2017 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2017. On November 2, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on December 22, 2017 to shareholders of record on December 8, 2017. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, as discussed further in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase of $2.5 billion to the share repurchase authorization. As of November 2, 2017, approximately $2.2 billion remained under the authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased approximately 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.3 billion pursuant to this authorization.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 167      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources      Dividend Restrictions  Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities.  For a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2016 Annual Report.    Enterprise Risk Management  Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring and reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2016 Annual Report. Credit Risk Management Overview Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.  For further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures see Investments – Available for Sale Securities.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 168      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Our credit risk management framework incorporates the following elements:     Risk Identification   including the ongoing capture and monitoring of all existing, contingent, potential and emerging credit risk exposures, whether funded or unfunded     Risk Measurement   comprising risk ratings, default probabilities, loss given default and expected loss parameters, exposure calculations, stress testing and other risk analytics     Risk Limits   including, but not limited to, a system of single obligor or risk group-based AIG-wide house limits and sub-limits for corporates, financial institutions, sovereigns and sub-sovereigns when appropriate and a defined process for identifying, evaluating, documenting and approving, if appropriate, breaches of and exceptions to such limits     Risk Delegations   a comprehensive credit risk delegation framework from the AIG Chief Credit Officer (CCO) to authorized credit professionals throughout the company     Risk Evaluation, Monitoring and Reporting   including the ongoing analysis and assessment of credit risks, trending of those risks and reporting of other key risk metrics and limits to the AIG CCO and senior management, as may be required     Credit Reserving   including but not limited to development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and (ii) other-than-temporary impairments for securities portfolios    Market Risk Management Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Risk Identification Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 169      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:     Equity prices   We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.     Residential and commercial real estate values   Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.     Interest rates   Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.     Credit spreads   Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long‑term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit‑worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.     Foreign exchange (FX) rates   We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.     Commodity Prices   Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.     Inflation   Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.    Risk Measurement  Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis. In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 170      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:             Examples include:     Sensitivity analysis   measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input   • a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,  • a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and  • a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.     Scenario analysis   uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures   • a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, or  • a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets.  Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.     Stress testing   a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome   • the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.

At December 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.9 billion of $292.5 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.  (b) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 171      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.  Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at September 30, 2017, decreased by $3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.4 billion decrease in our Japanese yen position primarily due to the sale of Fuji Life and a $1.1 billion decrease in our euro position primarily due to the issuance of €1.0 billion euro denominated debt.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.  AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements. Risk Identification  The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.     Market/Monetization Risk   Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.     Cash Flow Mismatch Risk   Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.     Event Funding Risk   Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.     Financing Risk   We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.          AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 172      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Risk Measurement Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.  We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:     Minimum Liquidity Limits   Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.     Coverage Ratios   Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.     Cash Flow Forecasts   Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.     Stress Testing   Asset liquidity and Coverage Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.    Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.  Regulatory Environment   Overview Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions in which they do business.  Regulatory developments On September 29, 2017, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) rescinded its determination that material financial distress at AIG could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability and as a result, AIG is no longer designated as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (nonbank SIFI). With the rescission of its designation as a nonbank SIFI, AIG is no longer subject to the consolidated supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) or subject to the enhanced prudential standards set forth in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) and its implementing regulations.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 173      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    U.S. REGULATION Dodd-Frank On July 21, 2010, Dodd-Frank, which brought about the most extensive changes to financial regulation in the United States in many years, was signed into law. Although the Council has rescinded its designation of AIG as a nonbank SIFI, certain provisions of Dodd-Frank remain relevant to insurance groups generally. · The Council has authority to determine, subject to certain statutory and regulatory standards, that any nonbank financial company be designated as a nonbank SIFI subject to supervision by the FRB and enhanced prudential standards. The Council may also recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.  · Title II of Dodd-Frank (Orderly Liquidation Authority) provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the Bankruptcy Code. That process is to be administered by the FDIC upon a determination that the company is: (i) in default or in danger of default, (ii) would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability were it to fail and be resolved, (iii) is not likely to attract private sector alternatives to default and (iv) is not suitable for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. Dodd-Frank authorizes possible assessments to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II. U.S. insurance subsidiaries of any such financial company, however, would be subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state insurance law.  · Title VII of Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions that have affected and, as additional regulations come into effect, could affect various activities of insurance and other financial services companies, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps and security-based swaps, (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated swap execution facilities for certain swaps and security-based swaps and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. Although the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees and regulates the U.S. swap, commodities and futures markets, has finalized most of its requirements, the SEC has yet to finalize the majority of rules comprising its security-based swap regulatory regime. Increased regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions could increase the cost of our trading and hedging activities, reduce liquidity and reduce the availability of customized hedging solutions and derivatives. · Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts should be included in the definition of "swap." If that study concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a swap for stable value contracts is appropriate and in the public interest. Certain of our affiliates participate in the stable value contract business. We cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the aforementioned study or be promulgated applicable to this business in the future. · Title V of Dodd-Frank authorizes the United States to enter into covered agreements with foreign governments or entities regarding the business of insurance and reinsurance and on September 22, 2017, the U.S. and EU entered into such an agreement. For additional information, see —International Regulation.  · Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity. The CFPB does have authority to regulate certain non-insurance consumer services. · The Federal Insurance Office (FIO), an office within the Department of the Treasury, itself is not a regulator but performs certain duties related to the business of insurance. Among other things, FIO is a non-voting member of the Council and has authority to collect information on the insurance industry, recommend prudential standards, participate in negotiations of international agreements affecting insurance, determine, after consulting with the relevant State and the United States Trade Representative, if certain regulations are preempted by covered agreements, and assist the Secretary in administering the Terrorism Insurance Program under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.   AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 174      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    On February 3, 2017, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order that directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with federal financial regulators, to assess all laws, rules and policies that regulate the U.S. financial system, including requirements put into place under Dodd-Frank since 2010, and to recommend necessary changes to make sure they conform to certain core principles. Treasury divided its review into four parts and has published three reports to date: Banks and Credit Unions (June 12, 2017), Capital Markets (October 6, 2017), and Asset Management and Insurance (October 26, 2017). A fourth report on other nonbank financial institutions, financial technology, and financial innovation is to appear later. In its report on insurance regulation, Treasury identified several areas for improvement at the federal and state levels and defined the role it intends for federal agencies. Among its recommendations, Treasury expressed support for an activities-based approach to regulating systemic risk in the insurance industry rather than designating individual entities; it recommended continued U.S. engagement in international standard setting forums and charged FIO with coordinating the efforts of the federal government, state regulators, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and other stakeholders on the issues within its scope, such as covered agreements, matters related to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, and standard setting at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), including discussions regarding capital and liquidity requirements; Treasury expressed support for robust liquidity risk management programs for insurers and encouraged regulators to continue work on addressing potential liquidity risk in the insurance sector; Treasury also supported the DOL in delaying full implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule until relevant issues are further evaluated and addressed by the DOL, SEC, and state insurance regulators working together. For additional information regarding the DOL Fiduciary Rule, see Executive Summary — AIG’s Outlook — Industry and Economic Factors — Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule. We will monitor developments resulting from these recommendations closely. Insurance Regulation Certain states and other jurisdictions require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such jurisdictions and are controlled by other entities. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the entity that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercompany transactions and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. This legislation also requires any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10 percent) of our outstanding voting securities to obtain regulatory approval prior to such purchase. Our subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those jurisdictions that have such requirements.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions in which they do business. The method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to a state insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers and their corporate conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including with respect to risk-based capital, the standards on transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates, including restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes and enterprise risk management and corporate governance requirements. Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to requirements on investments, which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments they can make. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the creditors or equity owners of these companies.  U.S. states have state insurance guaranty associations in which insurers doing business in the state are required by law to be members. Member insurers may be assessed by the associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess member insurers in amounts related to the member’s proportionate share of the business written by all members in the state. The protection afforded by a state’s guaranty association to policyholders of insolvent insurers varies from state to state.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 175      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    In the U.S., the NAIC is a standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The NAIC itself is not a regulator, but, with assistance from the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer review and coordinate regulatory oversight. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, and provides four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business and computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to various asset, premium, reserve and other financial statement items. These factors are developed to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk. The statutory surplus of each of our U.S. based insurance companies exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2016. If any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity. For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries — Insurance Companies. The NAIC’s Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs. See Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Annual Report for risks and additional information related to these statutory reserving requirements. In December 2012, the NAIC approved a new valuation manual containing a principle-based approach to life insurance company reserves. Principle-based reserving (PBR) is designed to tailor the reserving process to specific products in an effort to create a principle-based modeling approach to reserving rather than the factor-based approach historically employed. PBR became effective on January 1, 2017, after NAIC’s model Standard Valuation Law was enacted by the requisite number of states representing the required premium volume, replacing Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX with respect to new life insurance business issued after that date. Two of our domiciliary states (Missouri and Texas) have adopted the regulations necessary to implement PBR. We have up to three years after January 1, 2017 to implement PBR, and have currently elected to defer implementation. The NAIC has adopted revisions to the NAIC Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the Model Holding Company Act) and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation. The revised models include provisions authorizing NAIC commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups and participate in international supervisory colleges, and the requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer file an annual enterprise risk report with its lead state regulator identifying risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of its licensed insurers or the insurance holding company system as a whole. All of the states where AIG has domestic insurers have enacted a version of the revised Model Holding Company Act, including the enterprise risk reporting requirement. The NAIC has also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (ORSA). ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in normal and stressed environments. All of the states where AIG has domestic insurers have enacted a version of ORSA. ERISA Considerations  We provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code). Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. As a result, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. ERISA also provides for civil and criminal penalties and enforcement.  For additional information regarding the DOL Fiduciary Rule, see Executive Summary — AIG’s Outlook — Industry and Economic Factors — Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 176      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    Investment Adviser, Broker-Dealer and Investment Company Regulation Our investment products and services are subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including ERISA, and other laws and regulations. The SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, CFTC, state securities commissions, state insurance departments and the DOL are the principal U.S. regulators of these operations. The subsidiaries that manage the operations of our investment products are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are required to supervise the activities of their personnel. Our affiliates that offer interests in insurance company separate accounts, mutual funds and other pooled investment products, and that provide other financial services to customers, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC under the Exchange Act and with certain states, and are also members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Our broker-dealer subsidiaries and their personnel are subject to examination by the SEC, FINRA, and the states for compliance with law, and certain personnel of these broker-dealers are also required to pass qualification examinations. Sales to retirement accounts are subject to the DOL Fiduciary Rule. The investment products that are offered by our affiliates may be registered under the Securities Act, which regulates disclosure regarding the products, and/or the Investment Company of 1940, which imposes substantive regulation on the structure and governance of the products, as well as being subject to insurance regulation in the case of separate accounts. Some products may also be qualified for sale in various states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Consumer Protection and Cybersecurity We are subject to laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of sensitive consumer information and to notify their customers and other stakeholders of their policies and practices relating to the collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information. In addition, we must comply with international privacy laws and regulations concerning the cross border transfer or use of employee and customer personal information. These laws and regulations also (i) require specific safeguards around the use of sensitive information such as social security numbers and require notice to affected individuals and regulators in the case of a breach of security, (ii) require the adoption of processes to prevent and mitigate the effects of identity theft and (iii) establish permissible uses of protected personal and consumer information.  The NAIC has been developing an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which would require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, and oversee the data security practices of third-party vendors. It is not clear whether or not, or in what form, the Insurance Data Security Model Law will be adopted by states in which we have licensed insurers and other licensed subsidiaries.  In February 2017, the NY DFS announced the adoption of a new cybersecurity regulation requiring financial services institutions to implement a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data. The regulation includes specific technical safeguards as well as governance, incident planning, data management, system testing and regulator notification requirements. The regulation went into effect on March 1, 2017, providing for a 180 day transitional period with compliance required in stages thereafter. Thrift Regulator AIG Federal Savings Bank, our trust-only federal thrift subsidiary, is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. INTERNATIONAL REGULATION Insurance Regulation A substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements; licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and therefore these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.  Certain jurisdictions require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such jurisdictions and are controlled by other entities. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the entity that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercompany transactions and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary within the holding company system. Our subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those jurisdictions that have such requirements.     AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 177      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    In addition to these licensing and other requirements, our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including our subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.  Legislation in the EU could also affect our international insurance operations. The European Parliament issues Directives on a wide range of topics that impact financial services. Insurance companies operating in the EU are subject to the Solvency II framework. The Prudential Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom’s (UK’s) prudential regulator, is our lead EU prudential supervisor. For information on the UK’s pending withdrawal of its membership in the EU, see —Brexit. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has oversight of AIG’s operations for consumer protection and competition matters within the UK. In addition, financial companies that operate in the EU are subject to a range of regulations enforced by the national regulators in each member state in which that firm operates. The EU has also established a set of regulatory requirements under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) that include, among other things, risk mitigation, risk management, regulatory reporting and clearing requirements. Solvency II governs the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. In accordance with Solvency II, the European Commission is required to make a determination as to whether a supervisory regime outside of the EU is “equivalent.”  On September 22, 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, on behalf of the U.S., and the European Union signed the bilateral Covered Agreement, which is intended to address issues regarding the application of Solvency II requirements to U.S.-based insurance groups as well as other (re)insurance regulatory issues. While the signatures by both parties will allow for the provisional application of the agreement, the agreement is still subject to approval by the European Parliament before it enters into force. Other aspects of the agreement remain subject to an implementation timetable in the U.S. and the European Union, which may delay or even prevent the agreement from being fully implemented. In particular, the U.S. states will be given a period of five years to comply with the agreement’s reinsurance collateral provisions. After 42 months, FIO must begin evaluating a potential preemption determination with respect to any state law not in compliance with the aim of assuring full compliance within the five-year timeframe. The agreement may be terminated (following mandatory consultation) by notice from one party to the other effective in 180 days, or at such time as the parties may agree. The agreement provides that AIG will be supervised at the worldwide group level only by its relevant U.S. insurance supervisors, and that it will not have to satisfy EU Solvency II group capital, reporting and governance requirements for its worldwide group. The agreement, however, would permit the imposition of EU Solvency II group capital requirements if, after five years from the signing of the agreement, a U.S. insurer is not subject to a group capital assessment by its applicable state regulator. The NAIC is in the process of developing a group capital calculation that, once adopted by the states, is expected to satisfy this condition. The agreement further provides that if the summary risk reports submitted to the supervisory authority of a host jurisdiction expose any serious threat to policyholder protection or financial stability in such host state, the host supervisor may request further information from the insurance group and/or impose preventive or corrective measures with respect to the (re)insurer in its jurisdiction. The agreement also seeks to impose equal treatment of U.S. and EU-based reinsurers that meet certain qualifications. In the U.S., once fully implemented, the agreement requires U.S. states to lift reinsurance collateral requirements on qualifying EU-based reinsurers and provide them equal treatment with U.S. reinsurers or be subject to federal preemption. While this provision does not preclude AIG from continuing to request collateral from an EU reinsurer that is party to a bilateral reinsurance transaction, it is unclear how much collateral AIG will be able to obtain from EU reinsurers going forward. FSB and IAIS  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 countries. The FSB itself is not a regulator but is focused primarily on promoting international financial stability. It does so by coordinating the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies as well as developing and promoting the implementation of regulatory, supervisory and other financial policies. The FSB has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as systemic financial risk, financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 178      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Regulatory Environment    The IAIS represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions (including regions and states) in nearly 140 countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IAIS itself is not a regulator, but one of its activities is to develop insurance regulatory standards for use by local authorities across the globe. The FSB has charged the IAIS with developing a framework for measuring systemic risks posed by insurance groups and has directed the IAIS to create standards relative to many of the areas of focus of the FSB, which go beyond the IAIS’ basic Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). The IAIS is developing ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). ComFrame sets out qualitative and quantitative standards in order to assist supervisors in collectively addressing an IAIG’s activities and risks, identifying and avoiding regulatory gaps and coordinating supervisory activities. ComFrame is expected to include standards for group supervision, governance and internal controls, enterprise risk management, and recovery and resolution planning. Also in connection with ComFrame, the IAIS is in the process of developing a risk-based global insurance capital standard (ICS) applicable to IAIGs. We currently meet the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. ComFrame standards are expected to be finalized in 2019, and the IAIS is conducting field testing of ComFrame, including the ICS, ahead of that deadline. It is expected that the ComFrame and ICS standards finally adopted by the IAIS would be ready for adoption by implementing member jurisdictions beginning in 2020. Based on the IAIS’ assessment methodology for identifying global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), the FSB has identified nine G-SIIs, including us. The IAIS intends G-SIIs to be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning, enhanced group-wide supervision, enhanced liquidity and systemic risk management planning; and group-wide capital standards, including higher loss absorbency (HLA) capital. The IAIS’ basic capital requirement (BCR) was endorsed by the FSB in October 2014 and by the G20 countries in November 2014. The BCR covers all group activities, and we report our BCR ratios to supervisory authorities annually on a confidential basis. The BCR serves as the initial foundation for the application of HLA requirements. In October 2015, the IAIS announced that it had concluded initial development of the HLA requirements, according to which we reported on a confidential basis to supervisors in 2016. In February 2017, the IAIS announced the adoption of a three-year systemic risk assessment and policy workplan due to be finalized by year-end 2019. This initiative is comprised of a new macroprudential activities-based approach to regulating systemic risk which will be developed in conjunction with the IAIS’ previously announced work in finalizing ComFrame, including the global insurance capital standard, as well as any improvements to the existing G-SII methodology. Expected revisions to the HLA requirements will occur once the systemic risk assessment and policy workplan have been finalized and adopted. It is not known what effect the removal of AIG’s designation as a nonbank SIFI will have on its status as a G-SII or how any standards that might result from the IAIS’ initiatives might be implemented in the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world, or how they might apply to AIG.  The standards issued by the FSB and/or the IAIS are not binding on the United States or other jurisdictions around the world unless and until the appropriate local governmental bodies or regulators adopt appropriate laws and regulations. At this time, it is not known how the IAIS’ frameworks and/or standards might be implemented in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world, or how they might apply to us. Brexit On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which a majority voted for the UK to withdraw its membership in the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The terms of withdrawal are subject to a formal negotiation period which was initiated on March 29, 2017 through the invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Negotiations on Brexit could, by treaty, last up to two years. It is not clear at this stage (and may not be for some time) what form the UK’s future relationship with the remaining EU member states will take. We have significant operations and employees in the UK and other EU member states, including AIG Europe Ltd., which enjoys certain benefits based on the UK’s membership in the EU. In order to adapt to Brexit, on March 8, 2017, we announced plans to reorganize our operations and legal entity structure in the UK and the EU through the establishment of a new European subsidiary in Luxembourg. The reorganization is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals. Derivatives  Regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions have been proposed or adopted outside the United States. For instance, the EU has also established a set of new regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under EMIR. These requirements include, among other things, various risk mitigation, risk management, margin posting and regulatory reporting requirements that have already become effective and clearing requirements that were outlined in EU delegated legislation at the end of 2015 and are phased in over three years. These requirements could result in increased administrative costs with respect to our EU derivatives activities and overlapping or inconsistent regulation depending on the ultimate application of cross-border regulatory requirements between and among U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 179      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary       Glossary  Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs and certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting.  Additional premium Represents a premium on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium imposed at the beginning of the policy. An additional premium may be assessed if the insured’s risk is found to have increased significantly. Assets under administration include assets under management and Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement mutual fund assets that we sell or administer. Assets under management include assets in the general and separate accounts of our subsidiaries that support liabilities and surplus related to our life and annuity insurance products and the notional value of stable value wrap contracts. Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book value per common share excluding AOCI is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels. CVA Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in AIGFP's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only, without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk in the fair value measurement of all derivative net liability positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments An adjustment to DAC for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (also referred to as “shadow DAC”).       AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 180      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. General operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses. GIC/GIA Guaranteed Investment Contract/Guaranteed Investment Agreement A contract whereby the seller provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. G-SII Global Systemically Important Insurer An insurer that is deemed globally systemically important (that is, of such size, market importance and global interconnectedness that the distress or failure of the insurer would cause significant dislocation in the global financial system and adverse economic consequences across a range of countries) by the Financial Stability Board, in consultation with and based on a methodology developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.  Life Insurance Companies include the following major operating companies: American General, VALIC and U.S. Life. Loss Ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.  Loss reserve development The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to prior years as a result of the re-estimation of loss reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves  Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each. Catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. Net premiums written Represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period, while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. Noncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. Operating revenue excludes Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Policy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses. Pool  A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage.    AIG | Third Quarter 2017 Form 10-Q 181      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Premiums and deposits – Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Life Insurance include direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and group benefit policies, and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds.

RBC Risk-Based Capital  A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. Reinstatement premium Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. Retroactive Reinsurance S ee Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance. Return on equity – After-tax operating income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Return on Equity) is a non-GAAP measure and is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. Adjusted Return on Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity.  Return premium represents amounts given back to the insured in the case of a cancellation, an adjustment to the rate or an overpayment of an advance premium. Salvage The amount that can be recovered by an insurer for the sale of damaged goods for which a policyholder has been indemnified (and to which title was transferred). Severe losses Individual non-catastrophe first party losses and surety losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance and salvage and subrogation. Severe losses include claims related to satellite explosions, plane crashes, and shipwrecks. SIA Sales Inducement Asset Represents enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on certain annuity and investment contract products that meet the criteria to be deferred and amortized over the life of the contract. Solvency II  Legislation in the European Union which reforms the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards.

ITEM 4 | Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2017. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2017, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.

During the September 1-30 period, we also repurchased 70,000 warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, at an average purchase price per warrant of $18.24, for an aggregate purchase price of $1 million. (b) Reflects the purchase of 115,000 and 70,000 warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock in the August 1-31 and September 1-30 periods, respectively, which reduced the dollar value of the remaining repurchase authorization. (c) On May 3, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $2.5 billion to the share repurchase authorization. As of November 2, 2017, approximately $2.2 billion remained under the authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares of AIG Common Stock under this authorization for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $275 million. We also repurchased 185,000 warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million.
