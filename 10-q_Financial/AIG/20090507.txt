Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 (as amended, the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K). AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     In addition to reviewing AIG’s results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect developments in or affecting AIG’s business to date during 2009. Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Statutory underwriting profit (loss) is presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. AIG also uses cross-references to additional information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject.     Overview     Operations     AIG identifies its operating segments by product line, consistent with its management structure. These segments are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions.     AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG’s Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals.     Consideration of AIG’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern     In the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, management disclosed the conditions and events that led management to conclude that AIG would have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG’s businesses, execute its asset disposition plan and repay its obligations for at least the next twelve months. At that time, the United States government issued the following statement referring to the March 2009 agreements in principle and other transactions they expected to undertake with AIG to strengthen its capital position, enhance its liquidity, reduce its borrowing costs and facilitate AIG’s asset disposition program.     “The steps announced today provide tangible evidence of the U.S. government’s commitment to the orderly restructuring of AIG over time in the face of continuing market dislocations and economic deterioration. Orderly restructuring is essential to AIG’s repayment of the support it has received from U.S. taxpayers and to preserving financial stability. The U.S. government is committed to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due.”     In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management assessed whether AIG had the ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In making this assessment, AIG considered:              •   The commitment of the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury to the orderly restructuring of AIG and their commitment to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due;      69    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   The liquidity events in the second half of 2008, including transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury;         •   AIG’s liquidity-related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the facility (the FRBNY Facility) provided by the FRBNY under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Agreement), between AIG and the FRBNY;         •   The level of AIG’s realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders’ equity and on the capital levels of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries;         •   The substantial resolution of the liquidity issues surrounding the multi-sector super senior credit default swap portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively AIGFP) and the U.S. securities lending program;         •   The additional capital provided to AIG by the Department of the Treasury;         •   Recently completed transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury;         •   The planned sales of significant subsidiaries;         •   The continuing liquidity issues in AIG’s businesses and AIG’s actions to address such issues; and         •   The substantial risks to which AIG is subject.       Each of these items is discussed in more detail below.     In considering these items, management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of AIG’s risks and uncertainties. Management also assessed other items and risks arising in AIG’s businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto. After consideration, management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG’s businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.     It is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management’s plans could be materially different or that one or more of management’s significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of the risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect or that the principal transactions discussed below are not consummated. If one or more of these possible outcomes is realized, AIG may need additional U.S. government support to meet its obligations as they come due.     Capital Resources and Liquidity     Liquidity     Liquidity Events in the Second Half of 2008     In the second half of 2008, AIG experienced an unprecedented strain on liquidity. The two principal causes of the liquidity strain were demands for the return of cash collateral under the U.S. securities lending program and collateral calls on AIGFP’s super senior multi-sector collateralized debt obligation (CDO) credit default swap portfolio. Both of these liquidity strains were significantly exacerbated by the downgrades of AIG’s long-term debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) on September 15, 2008. This strain led to a series of transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury. See the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of these agreements, which are outlined below.              •   FRBNY Credit Agreement         •   Issuance of AIG’s Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series D Preferred Stock)         •   Termination of $62 billion of credit default swaps         •   Resolution of U.S. Securities Lending Program         •   AIG Affiliates’ Participation in FRBNY’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)      70    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   Issuance of AIG’s Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series C Preferred Stock). See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the issuance of the AIG Series C Preferred Stock.       2009 Completed and Proposed Transactions     Exchange of AIG Series D Preferred Stock for AIG Series E Preferred Stock     On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the Series E Exchange Agreement) with the Department of the Treasury pursuant to which, among other things, the Department of the Treasury exchanged 4,000,000 shares of AIG Series D Preferred Stock for 400,000 shares of AIG’s Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series E Preferred Stock), with an aggregate liquidation preference of $41,604,576,000, which represents the issuance-date aggregate liquidation preference of the AIG Series D Preferred Stock surrendered plus accumulated but unpaid dividends thereon. The terms of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock are substantially the same as those of the AIG Series D Preferred Stock, except that the dividends are not cumulative, the liquidation preferences per share differ, and the AIG Series E Preferred Stock is subject to a replacement capital covenant. Concurrently with the exchange of the shares of AIG Series D Preferred Stock for shares of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock, AIG entered into a replacement capital covenant in favor of the holders of a series of AIG debt, pursuant to which AIG agreed that prior to the third anniversary of the issuance of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock, AIG will not redeem or purchase, and no subsidiary of AIG will purchase, all or any part of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock except with the proceeds obtained from the issuance by AIG or any subsidiary of AIG of certain capital securities.     The Series E Exchange Agreement also permits the Department of the Treasury, under certain circumstances, to exchange the warrant received in connection with the issuance of the AIG Series D Preferred Stock (AIG Series D Warrant) for 53,798,766 shares of the AIG Series C Preferred Stock.     Issuance of AIG Series F Preferred Stock and Entry into $29.835 billion Department of the Treasury Commitment     On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Series F Purchase Agreement) with the Department of the Treasury pursuant to which, among other things, AIG issued to the Department of the Treasury (i) 300,000 shares of AIG’s Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series F Preferred Stock), and (ii) a warrant (AIG Series F Warrant) to purchase 3,000 shares of AIG’s common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock).     Pursuant to the Series F Purchase Agreement, the Department of the Treasury has committed for five years to provide immediately available funds (the Department of the Treasury Commitment) in an amount up to $29.835 billion (the Available Amount) so long as:              •   AIG is not a debtor in a pending case under Title 11 of the United States Code; and         •   the Trust (or any successor entity established for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury) and the Department of the Treasury, in the aggregate, “beneficially owns” more than 50 percent of the aggregate voting power of AIG’s voting securities.       The Available Amount will be decreased by the aggregate amount of financial assistance that the Department of the Treasury provides to AIG, its subsidiaries or any special purpose vehicle established by or for the benefit of AIG or any of its subsidiaries after the issuance of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock and the AIG Series F Warrant, unless otherwise specified by the Department of the Treasury, in its sole discretion, under the terms of such financial assistance.     The Series E Exchange Agreement and the Series F Purchase Agreement restrict AIG’s ability to repurchase capital stock and require AIG to continue to maintain policies limiting corporate expenses, lobbying activities and executive compensation.     The terms of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock are substantially the same as the AIG Series E Preferred Stock, except that the liquidation preferences per share differ and the AIG Series F Preferred Stock is not subject to a    71    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     replacement capital covenant. The liquidation preference of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock is initially $0 per share and will be increased pro rata by the amount of each drawdown of the Department of the Treasury Commitment.     The AIG Series F Warrant is exercisable, at any time, at an initial exercise price of $0.000001 per share. The AIG Series F Warrant will not be subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer other than such as are necessary to ensure compliance with U.S. federal and state securities laws. The Department of the Treasury has agreed that it will not exercise any voting rights with respect to the AIG Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Series F Warrant.     Modification to the FRBNY Facility     On April 17, 2009, AIG and the FRBNY entered into Amendment No. 3 to the FRBNY Credit Agreement. The FRBNY Credit Agreement was amended, among other things, to:              •   remove the minimum 3.5 percent LIBOR borrowing rate floor; and         •   permit the issuance by AIG of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock, the AIG Series F Preferred Stock and the AIG Series F Warrant to the Department of the Treasury.       Repayment of the FRBNY Facility with Subsidiary Preferred Equity     On March 2, 2009, AIG and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced their intent to enter into transactions pursuant to which AIG will transfer to the FRBNY preferred equity interests in newly formed special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Each SPV will hold (directly or indirectly) 100 percent of the common stock of an AIG operating subsidiary (American International Assurance Company, Limited, together with American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited (AIA) in one case and American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) in the other). In exchange for the preferred equity interests received by the FRBNY, there would be a concurrent substantial reduction in the outstanding balance and maximum available amount to be borrowed under the FRBNY Facility.     Securitizations     On March 2, 2009, AIG and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced their intent to enter into a transaction pursuant to which AIG will issue to the FRBNY senior certificates in one or more newly-formed SPVs to be repaid with the net cash flows from designated blocks of existing life insurance policies in settlement of a portion of the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility. The amount of the FRBNY Facility reduction will be based on the proceeds received. The SPVs are expected to be consolidated by AIG.     Liquidity Position     At April 29, 2009, AIG had outstanding borrowings under the FRBNY Facility of $42.6 billion, with a remaining borrowing capacity of $17.4 billion, and accrued compounding interest and fees totaled $4.3 billion. At April 30, 2009, AIG had not drawn any amounts under the Department of the Treasury Commitment, and therefore had additional capacity to draw up to $29.835 billion thereunder.    72    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Net borrowings outstanding and remaining available amount that can be borrowed under the FRBNY Facility were as follows:                                                      Inception Through                 December 31,        March 31,        Increase            2008       2009       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Net borrowings:                               Loans to AIGFP for collateral postings, GIA and other debt maturities      $   46,997       $   51,347       $   4,350        AIGFP repayments to AIG        (4,093   )       (7,304   )       (3,211   )      Capital contributions and loans to insurance companies(a)        20,850         23,041         2,191        Repayment of obligations to securities lending program        3,160         3,160         —        Repayment of intercompany loans        1,528         1,528         —        Contributions to AIGCFG subsidiaries        1,672         1,694         22        Loans to ILFC        —         1,700         1,700        Debt payments        2,109         2,869         760        Funding of equity interest in ML III        5,000         5,000         —        Repayment from the proceeds of the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock and common stock warrant        (40,000   )       (40,000   )       —        Other(b)        (423   )       65         488                                    Net borrowings        36,800         43,100         6,300                                    Total FRBNY Facility        60,000         60,000         —                                    Remaining available amount        23,200         16,900         (6,300   )                                  Net borrowings        36,800         43,100         6,300        Accrued compounding interest and fees(c)        3,631         4,305         674                                    Total balance outstanding      $   40,431       $   47,405       $   6,974                                                 (a)    Includes securities lending activities.

AIG’s Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of AIG’s Obligations as They Come Due     Future Cash Requirements     The following table shows the maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                                                              Second        Third        Fourth        First                  Quarter        Quarter        Quarter        Quarter                  2009       2009       2009       2010       Total           (In millions)            AIG      $   116       $   4       $   1,000       $   888       $   2,008        AIG MIP        1,151         —         —         500         1,651        AIGFP        655         2,001         1,025         1,147         4,828        ILFC(a)        1,104         1,161         2,992         700         5,957        AGF(b)        931         3,209         1,662         659         6,461        Other subsidiaries        345         112         273         59         789                                                    Total      $   4,302       $   6,487       $   6,952       $   3,953       $   21,694                                                                 (a)    International Lease Finance Corporation.      (b)    American General Finance, Inc.      In addition, at April 29, 2009, AIG affiliates had $12.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding under the CPFF, including $4.9 billion issued by AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), with the majority of maturities in July 2009. If AIG’s short-term ratings are downgraded, AIG Funding may lose access to the CPFF and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper.     AIG expects to meet these obligations primarily through borrowings from the FRBNY Facility and the cash flows, including from dispositions, of assets supporting these obligations. Debt maturities for the Matched Investment Program (MIP) are expected to be funded through cash flows generated by the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program. Approximately $3.4 billion of AIGFP’s debt maturities through March 31, 2010 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities. It is expected that American General Finance, Inc. (AGF) and International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) will require support from AIG, in addition to their cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales and securitizations, to meet their existing obligations. AIG intends to provide such support through May 15, 2010.     In the first three months of 2009, AIG made capital contributions of $1.25 billion to certain of its Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies. If a substantial portion of the Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services bond portfolio diminishes significantly in value or suffers credit events, AIG may need to provide additional capital support for these operations.     In addition, AIG made capital contributions of $641 million to its Domestic General Insurance companies in the first three months of 2009. AIG does not anticipate making additional capital contributions to the Domestic General Insurance companies.     AIG has developed certain plans (described below), some of which have already been implemented, to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the FRBNY Facility; other plans are still being formulated.     Asset Disposition Plan     Since October 2008, when AIG originally announced a restructuring plan under which AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations and certain other businesses would be divested in whole or in part, AIG has sold certain businesses and assets and has entered into contracts to sell others. However, global market conditions have continued to deteriorate, posing risks to AIG’s ability to divest assets at acceptable values. As announced on March 2, 2009, AIG’s restructuring plan has evolved in response to these market conditions. Specifically, AIG’s    74    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     current plans involve transactions between AIG and the FRBNY with respect to AIA and ALICO. Additionally, AIG announced its plans to create an independent entity by transferring AIG’s U.S. property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses into a special purpose vehicle in preparation for the potential sale of a minority stake.     AIG believes that these current plans are necessary to maximize the value of its businesses over a longer time frame. Therefore, some businesses that have previously been prepared for sale will be divested, some will be held for later divestiture, and some businesses will be prepared for potential offerings to the public. Dispositions of certain businesses will be subject to regulatory approval. Proceeds from these dispositions, to the extent they do not represent required capital of AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries, are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the FRBNY Facility as mandatory prepayments.     In connection with AIG’s asset disposition plan, through April 30, 2009, AIG had sold, or entered into contracts to sell, the following operations:              •   On November 26, 2008, AIG closed the sale of its 50 percent stake in the Brazilian joint venture Unibanco AIG Seguros S.A. to AIG’s joint-venture partner Unibanco-União de Bancos Brasileiros S.A.         •   On December 18, 2008, AIG closed the sale of the assets of its Taiwan Finance business to Taiwan Acceptance Corporation.         •   On March 12, 2009, AIG closed the sale of AIG PhilAm Savings Bank, PhilAm Auto Financing and Leasing, and PFL Holdings to EastWest Banking Corporation.         •   On March 31, 2009, AIG closed the sale of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB), the parent company of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, to Munich Re Group.         •   On April 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of AIG Life Insurance Company of Canada to BMO Financial Group.         •   On April 8, 2009, AIG closed the sale of AIG Retail Bank Public Company Limited and AIG Card (Thailand) to Bank of Ayudhya.         •   On April 16, 2009, AIG closed the sale of AIG Private Bank Ltd. to Aabar Investments PJSC.         •   On April 16, 2009, AIG entered into a contract to sell 21st Century Insurance Group to Farmers Group, Inc. This sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2009.         •   On April 24, 2009, AIG closed the sale of Deutsche Versicherungs-und Rückversicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft (Darag), a German general insurance subsidiary of AIG subsidiary Württembergische und Badische Versicherungs-AG(WüBa) in Germany, to Augur.       These nine operations had total assets and liabilities with carrying values of approximately $19.7 billion and $15.9 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2009. Aggregate total proceeds from the sale of these nine businesses, including proceeds applied to repay intercompany loan facilities, are expected to be $4.6 billion. These nine transactions are expected to generate $2.2 billion of net cash proceeds.     AIG expects to divest its Institutional Asset Management businesses consisting of investment services that are offered to external clients. These businesses offered for sale exclude those providing traditional fixed income and shorter duration asset and liability management for AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries as well as proprietary real estate and private equity investments and the MIP. The separation of these asset management businesses will require the establishment of shared service arrangements between the remaining asset management businesses and those that are sold as well as the establishment of new asset management contracts, which will be determined in conjunction with the buyers of these businesses. AIG expects to continue relationships with the divested businesses for other investment management services used by certain AIG subsidiaries.     AIGFP is engaged in a multi-step process of unwinding its businesses and portfolios. In connection with that process, certain assets have been sold, or are under contract to be sold. The proceeds from these sales will be used to fund AIGFP’s wind-down and are not included in the amounts above. The FRBNY has waived the requirement under the FRBNY Credit Agreement that the proceeds of these specific pending sales be applied as a mandatory    75    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     prepayment under the FRBNY Facility, which would result in a permanent reduction of the FRBNY’s commitment to lend to AIG. Instead, the FRBNY has given AIGFP permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales, and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the FRBNY Facility, with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the FRBNY Facility. With the consent of the FRBNY, AIGFP is also opportunistically terminating contracts. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with AIG’s affiliated businesses. Due to the long-term duration of AIGFP’s derivative contracts and the complexity of AIGFP’s portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down of AIGFP will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG’s control, including market conditions, AIGFP’s access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.     AIG continually evaluates overall market conditions, performance of businesses that are for sale, and market and business performance of competitors and likely bidders for their assets. This evaluation informs decision-making about the timing and process of putting businesses up for sale. Depending on market and business conditions, as noted above, AIG can modify its sales approach to maximize value for AIG and the U.S. taxpayers in the disposition process. Such a modification could result in the sale of additional or other assets.     Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries     AIG (Parent Company)     At April 29, 2009, AIG parent had the following sources of liquidity:              •   $17.4 billion of available borrowings under the FRBNY Facility;         •   $1.94 billion of available commercial paper borrowings under the CPFF;         •   $445 million of cash and short-term investments; and         •   $29.835 billion of available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment.       As a result, AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that AIG’s cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls at AIGFP, a further downgrade of AIG’s credit ratings or unexpected capital or liquidity needs of AIG’s subsidiaries may result in significant additional cash needs. For a further discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Since the fourth quarter of 2008, AIG has not had access to its traditional sources of long-term or short-term financing through the public debt markets. Further, in light of AIG’s current common stock price, AIG does not expect to be able to issue equity securities in the public markets in the foreseeable future.     Historically AIG depended on dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. In light of AIG’s current financial situation, many of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG (see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K). As a result, AIG has been dependent on the FRBNY Facility, the CPFF and other transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury as its primary sources of liquidity. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, AIG parent collected $281 million in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries (primarily from insurance company subsidiaries), and retired $381 million of debt, excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. Excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt, AIG parent made interest payments totaling $366 million, and made $2.51 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries.     AIG parent funds a portion of its short-term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. Since October 2008, all commercial paper issuance for AIG Funding has been through the CPFF program. As of March 31, 2009, AIG Funding had $5.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 27 days, of which $14 million were non-CPFF borrowings.    76    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIG’s liquidity could also be further impaired by unforeseen significant outflows of cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may be unable to control, such as a further reduction in asset values, a worsening of the current recession or the requirements of subsidiaries to replace capital as a consequence of catastrophe claims. Regulatory and other legal restrictions would likely limit AIG’s ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.     AIG’s long-term unsecured debt and Equity Units have been trading at levels significantly below their face value. AIG continuously evaluates the possibility of repurchasing its long-term unsecured debt and Equity Units and may engage, with the consent of the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury, in public or privately negotiated debt or Equity Unit repurchases in the future.     General Insurance     AIG currently expects that its General Insurance subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. One or more large catastrophes, however, may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected General Insurance operations. In addition, further downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries. A downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect these companies’ ability to meet their own obligations and require that AIG provide capital or liquidity support to them. For a discussion of AIG’s potential inability to support its subsidiaries, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     At March 31, 2009, General Insurance had liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments of $12.1 billion. These are consolidated cash and short-term investments for a number of legal entities within General Insurance. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, there are generally sufficient cash and short-term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs. In the event additional liquidity is required, management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities. Government and corporate bonds represented 96.3 percent of General Insurance total fixed income investments at March 31, 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG’s General Insurance investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. AIG’s asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of AIG’s General Insurance investments and the payment of claims.     Life Insurance & Retirement Services     At March 31, 2009, Life Insurance & Retirement Services had liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments of $33.4 billion. These are consolidated cash and short-term investments for a number of legal entities within Life Insurance & Retirement Services. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, there are generally sufficient cash and short-term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs. In the event additional liquidity is required, management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities. Government and corporate bonds represented 85.6 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services total fixed income investments at March 31, 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. The Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries have been able to meet liquidity needs, even during the period of higher surrenders which was experienced from mid-September 2008 through March 31, 2009, and expect to be able to do so in the foreseeable future.     However, due to the significant decline in the value of the bond portfolio of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries, AIG has provided capital to support to these operations. A significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, which could be triggered by a variety of factors, including AIG-specific concerns, could result in a substantial liquidity strain. Other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic    77    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     collapse of a nation or region significant to Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other economic or political upheaval.     Foreign Life Insurance Companies     AIG’s Foreign Life Insurance companies (including ALICO) had significant capital needs following publicity of AIG parent’s liquidity issues, related credit ratings downgrades and the decline in the equity markets. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, AIG provided funding of $300 million to the Foreign Life Insurance companies.     AIG believes that its Foreign Life Insurance subsidiaries have adequate capital to support their business plans through 2009. However, to the extent the investment portfolios of the Foreign Life Insurance companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions, AIG may need to lend or contribute additional capital to these companies. For a discussion of AIG’s potential inability to support its subsidiaries, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services Companies     During the three months ended March 31, 2009, AIG contributed capital totaling $1.25 billion to certain of its Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services subsidiaries to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses (primarily resulting from other-than-temporary impairment charges). Further capital contributions will be required to maintain desired levels of capital to the extent the investment portfolios of the Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions.     The most significant potential liquidity need of AIG’s Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies is the funding of surrenders. A substantial increase in surrender activity could place stress on the liquidity of these companies and require asset sales or contributions from AIG. At the current rate of surrenders, AIG believes that its Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies will have sufficient resources to meet these obligations. However, AIG may need to inject additional capital to offset statutory other-than-temporary impairment charges for the Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies. For a discussion of AIG’s potential inability to support its subsidiaries, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Financial Services     AIG’s major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of ILFC, AIGFP, AGF and AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). Traditional sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available. These sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), issuance of long-and short-term debt, issuance of commercial paper, bank loans and bank credit facilities. However, ILFC has been able to finance Airbus aircraft purchases under its 2004 Export Credit Agency (ECA) Facility and AIGCFG has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits, providing a measure of liquidity.     ILFC     Prior to September 2008, ILFC’s traditional sources of liquidity had been collections of aircraft lease payments, borrowing in the public debt markets and under its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities to fund aircraft purchases and to satisfy maturing debt, proceeds of aircraft sales and income from third parties for fleet management services.     During the first quarter of 2009, ILFC was unable to borrow in the public debt markets and, due to downgrades in its short-term credit rating, lost access to the CPFF and therefore borrowed $1.7 billion from AIG Funding to repay its maturing debt and other contractual obligations. ILFC is pursuing secured financings from banks and manufacturers. ILFC has the capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing of approximately $5.0 billion (or more through subsidiaries that qualify as non-restricted subsidiaries under ILFC’s    78    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     indentures, subject to the receipt of any required consents under the FRBNY Facility and under its bank facilities and terms loans). If ILFC does not receive sufficient secured financing, AIG expects that ILFC’s current borrowings and future cash flows from operations, which may include aircraft sales, will be inadequate to permit ILFC to meet its existing obligations. Therefore, AIG intends to provide support to ILFC through May 15, 2010.     As a result of Moody’s downgrade of ILFC’s long-term debt rating to Baa2 on March 17, 2009, ILFC needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 ECA Facility before it can fund Airbus purchases under the facility. ILFC financed eight aircraft under the facility during the first quarter of 2009, two of which required written consent, which was obtained. ILFC’s current credit ratings also require segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves related to aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts. At March 31, 2009, ILFC had segregated approximately $265 million of deposits and maintenance reserves. The amount of funds segregated fluctuates with changes in the related deposits, maintenance reserves and debt maturities. Further downgrades would impose additional restrictions under the 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities, including the requirement to segregate rental payments and to receive prior consent to withdraw funds from the segregated accounts.     AIGFP     Prior to September 2008, AIGFP had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds, GIA borrowings, other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements.     In the second half of 2008, AIGFP’s access to its traditional sources of liquidity was significantly reduced and it relied on AIG parent to meet most of its liquidity needs. AIGFP’s asset backed commercial paper conduit, Curzon Funding LLC, was accepted into the CPFF with a total borrowing limit of $7.2 billion, and had approximately $6.3 billion outstanding at April 29, 2009. Separately, a structured investment vehicle sponsored, but not consolidated, by AIGFP, Nightingale Finance LLC, was also accepted into the CPFF with a borrowing limit of $1.1 billion. As of April 29, 2009, this vehicle had issued approximately $1.1 billion under the CPFF.     The following table presents a roll forward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP:                                                                  Collateral              Collateral        Collateral        For the Three Months Ended      Posted as of        Additional        Returned by        Posted as of         March 31, 2009      December 31, 2008       Postings       Counterparties       March 31, 2009           (In millions)            Collateralized GIAs and other borrowings      $   9,401       $   124       $   1,736       $   7,789        Derivatives (including super senior credit default swaps)        22,791         3,611         1,626         24,776                                            Total      $   32,192       $   3,735       $   3,362       $   32,565                                               AGF     Prior to September 2008, AGF’s traditional source of liquidity has been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets.     AGF anticipates that, going forward, its primary source of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections. In order to improve cash flow from operations, AGF has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses. In addition, AGF is considering potential sales or securitization of its finance receivables. AIG intends to provide support to AGF through May 15, 2010. With AIG’s continued support, AIG believes that AGF will have adequate funds to meet its debt and other obligations payable during the next twelve months.     AIGCFG     AIG believes that the funding needs of AIGCFG have stabilized, but it is possible that renewed customer and counterparty concerns could substantially increase AIGCFG’s liquidity needs in 2009. Through April 15, 2009, AIG has completed the sale of certain AIGCFG businesses in Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines.    79    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Asset Management     Asset Management’s principal cash requirements are to fund general working capital needs, investment commitments related to proprietary investments in private equity and real estate as well as any liquidity mismatches in the Spread-Based Investment business. Cash requirements related to Institutional Asset Management are funded through general operating cash flows from management and performance fees, proceeds from events in underlying funds (capital calls to third parties, sale of portfolio companies, etc.) as well as intercompany funding provided by AIG. Consequently, Institutional Asset Management’s ability to fund certain of its needs may depend on advances from AIG under various intercompany borrowing facilities. Restrictions on these facilities would have adverse consequences on the ability of the business to satisfy its obligations. With respect to the Global Real Estate business, investing activities are also funded through third-party financing arrangements which are secured by the relevant properties.     The Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) and MIP programs are in run-off. AIG expects to fund its obligations under these programs through cash flows generated from invested assets (principal and interest) as well as sales of investments, primarily fixed maturity securities. However, market illiquidity and diminished values within the investment portfolios may impair AIG’s ability to sell the related program assets or sell such assets for a price adequate to settle the corresponding liabilities when they come due. In such a case, AIG parent would need to fund the obligations.    80    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Debt     Total debt was as follows:                                          March 31,        December 31,            2009       2008           (In millions)            Debt issued by AIG:                       FRBNY Facility (secured)      $   47,405       $   40,431        Notes and bonds payable        11,221         11,756        Junior subordinated debt        11,520         11,685        Junior subordinated debt attributable to equity units        5,880         5,880        Loans and mortgages payable        370         416        MIP matched notes and bonds payable        13,953         14,446        Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable        4,296         4,660                            Total AIG debt        94,645         89,274                            Debt guaranteed by AIG:                       AIGFP, at fair value                       Commercial paper(a)        6,747         6,802        GIAs        10,716         13,860        Notes and bonds payable        3,538         5,250        Loans and mortgages payable        1,981         2,175        Hybrid financial instrument liabilities        1,257         2,113                            Total AIGFP debt        24,239         30,200                            AIG Funding commercial paper(a)        5,509         6,856                            AIGLH notes and bonds payable        798         798                            Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock        1,299         1,415                            Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG        126,490         128,543                            Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                       ILFC                       Commercial paper(a)        2         1,748        Junior subordinated debt        999         999        Notes and bonds payable, ECA Facilities and bank financings(b)        29,343         30,047                            Total ILFC debt        30,344         32,794                            AGF                       Commercial paper and extendible commercial notes        58         188        Junior subordinated debt        349         349        Notes and bonds payable        22,129         23,089                            Total AGF debt        22,536         23,626                            AIGCFG                       Commercial paper        122         124        Loans and mortgages payable        1,270         1,596                            Total AIGCFG debt        1,392         1,720                            Other subsidiaries        639         670                            Debt of consolidated investments held through:                       AIG Investments        1,312         1,300        AIG Global Real Estate Investment        4,485         4,545        AIG SunAmerica        5         5                            Total debt of consolidated investments        5,802         5,850                            Total debt not guaranteed by AIG        60,713         64,660                            Total debt:                       Total commercial paper and extendible commercial notes        196         613        Federal Reserve Bank of New York commercial paper funding facility        12,242         15,105        Total long-term debt        174,765         177,485                            Total debt      $   187,203       $   193,203                                         (a)    Includes borrowings of $6.7 billion and $5.5 billion for AIGFP (through Curzon Funding LLC, AIGFP’s asset-backed commercial paper conduit) and AIG Funding, respectively, under the CPFF at March 31, 2009 and $6.8 billion, $6.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, for AIGFP (through Curzon Funding LLC, AIGFP’s asset-backed commercial paper conduit), AIG Funding and ILFC, respectively, under the CPFF at December 31, 2008.

(b)    Reflects future minimum payment for ILFC’s borrowings under the 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities.      AIG (Parent Company)     AIG historically issued debt securities from time to time to meet its financing needs and those of certain of its subsidiaries, as well as to opportunistically fund the MIP. The maturities of the debt securities issued by AIG to fund the MIP are generally expected to be paid using the cash flows of assets held by AIG as part of the MIP portfolio. However, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows of the MIP, as well as shortfalls due to impairments of MIP assets, would need to be funded by AIG parent.     As of March 31, 2009, approximately $7.3 billion principal amount of senior notes were outstanding under AIG’s medium-term note program, of which $3.2 billion was used for AIG’s general corporate purposes, $714 million was used by AIGFP (included within “Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable” in the preceding tables) and $3.4 billion was used to fund the MIP. The maturity dates of these notes range from 2009 to    83    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     2052. To the extent considered appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.     As of March 31, 2009, the equivalent of $11.1 billion of notes were outstanding under AIG’s Euro medium-term note program, of which $9.2 billion were used to fund the MIP and the remainder was used for AIG’s general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount outstanding includes a $47 million gain resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars, including a $112 million gain related to notes issued by AIG for general corporate purposes and a $65 million loss related to notes issued to fund the MIP. AIG has economically hedged the currency exposure arising from its foreign currency denominated notes.     AIGFP      Approximately $3.4 billion of AIGFP’s debt maturing through March 31, 2010 is fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities. However, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and AIGFP’s ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG parent.     ILFC      ILFC has a $4.3 billion 1999 ECA Facility that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.77 percent to 5.86 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At March 31, 2009, ILFC had 50 loans with a remaining principal balance of $312 million outstanding under this facility. Thirteen of these loans with a remaining principal balance of $26 million were paid off on April 1, 2009. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility.     ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 ECA Facility for up to a maximum of $3.6 billion to fund Airbus aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2009. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a forward-looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 1.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 4.20 percent to 4.71 percent. At March 31, 2009, ILFC had $2.3 billion outstanding under this facility. At March 31, 2009, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 1.73 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC’s notes and bonds payable in the preceding table of borrowings.     At March 31, 2009, the total funded amount of ILFC’s bank financings was $7.6 billion, which includes $6.5 billion of revolving credit facilities (see Revolving Credit Facilities below). The fundings mature through February 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.63 percent. At March 31, 2009, the interest rates ranged from 1.52 percent to 2.88 percent. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.     AGF     As of March 31, 2009, notes and bonds aggregating $22.1 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from 0.30 percent to 9.00 percent. To the extent considered appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds.     AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF but has provided a capital support agreement for the benefit of AGF’s lenders under the AGF 364-Day Syndicated Facility. Under this support agreement, AIG has agreed to cause AGF to maintain (1) consolidated net worth of $2.2 billion and (2) an adjusted tangible leverage ratio of less than or equal to 8 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter.    84    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Revolving Credit Facilities     AIG, ILFC and AGF maintain committed, unsecured revolving credit facilities listed on the table below in order to support their respective commercial paper programs and for general corporate purposes. Some of the facilities, as noted below, contain a “term-out option” allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans.     Both ILFC and AGF have drawn the full amount available under their revolving credit facilities. AIG’s syndicated facilities contain a covenant requiring AIG to maintain total shareholders’ equity (calculated on a consolidated basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)) of at least $50 billion at all times. AIG calculates total shareholders’ equity for this purpose as the amount shown as Total equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with FAS 160. If AIG fails to maintain this level of total shareholders’ equity at any time, it will lose access to those facilities. Additionally, if an event of default occurs under those facilities, including AIG failing to maintain $50 billion of total shareholders’ equity at any time, which causes the banks to terminate either of those facilities, then AIG may be required to collateralize approximately $2.7 billion of letters of credit that AIG has obtained for the benefit of its insurance subsidiaries so that these subsidiaries may obtain statutory recognition of their intercompany reinsurance transactions.

Credit Ratings     The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of April 30, 2009.

These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.     “Ratings triggers” have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. “Ratings triggers” generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.     A significant portion of AIGFP’s GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require AIGFP, upon a downgrade of AIG’s long-term debt ratings, to post collateral or, with the consent of the counterparties, assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.     The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For the effect of a downgrade in AIG’s credit ratings, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    86    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Contractual Obligations     Contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity, are as follows:                                                                                                Payments Due by Period           Total        Remainder        2010 –        2012 –                     At March 31, 2009      Payments       of 2009       2011       2013       2014       Thereafter                       (In millions)                        Borrowings(a)      $   121,558       $   17,741       $   32,079       $   18,028       $   3,151       $   50,559        FRBNY Facility        47,405         —         —         47,405         —         —        Interest payments on borrowings        79,158         6,275         15,897         13,813         3,017         40,156        Loss reserves(b)        87,405         15,208         26,047         14,509         4,720         26,921        Insurance and investment contract liabilities(c)        621,685         20,192         38,257         41,892         21,088         500,256        GIC liabilities(d)        14,773         5,776         2,012         3,080         124         3,781        Aircraft purchase commitments        15,704         2,013         490         2,917         1,791         8,493        Other long-term obligations        507         192         290         11         1         13                                                            Total(e)(f)      $   988,195       $   67,397       $   115,072       $   141,655       $   33,892       $   630,179                                                                         (a)    Excludes commercial paper and borrowings incurred by consolidated investments and includes hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value.      (b)    Represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments.      (c)    Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of AIG’s control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on inforce policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the balance sheet.      (d)    Represents guaranteed maturities under GICs.      (e)    Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $3.4 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.      (f)    The majority of AIGFP’s credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At March 31, 2009, the fair value derivative liability was $6.7 billion relating to AIGFP’s super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, net of amounts realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, AIGFP has posted collateral of $6.2 billion with respect to these swaps (prior to offsets for other transactions).     87    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments     Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity were as follows:                                                                                                      Amount of Commitment Expiration           Total Amounts        Remainder        2010 –        2012 –                     At March 31, 2009      Committed       of 2009       2011       2013       2014       Thereafter           (In millions)            Guarantees:                                                       Liquidity facilities(a)      $   883       $   —       $   —       $   771       $   —       $   112        Standby letters of credit        1,441         1,258         34         18         —         131        Construction guarantees(b)        105         —         —         —         —         105        Guarantees of indebtedness        527         2         124         19         164         218        All other guarantees        2,297         48         46         188         51         1,964        Investment commitments(c)        8,931         2,349         2,937         2,058         1,247         340        Commitments to extend credit        478         125         299         52         —         2        Letters of credit        248         167         81         —         —         —        Other commercial commitments(d)        743         60         —         —         —         683                                                            Total(e)      $   15,653       $   4,009       $   3,521       $   3,106       $   1,462       $   3,555                                                                         (a)    Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.

(d)    Includes options to acquire aircraft. Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The annual pension contribution for 2009 is expected to be approximately $600 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.      (e)    Does not include guarantees or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.      Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities      AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business. AIG’s insurance companies are involved with VIEs primarily as passive investors in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. Through its Financial Services and Asset Management operations, AIG has participated in arrangements that included designing and structuring entities (including VIEs), warehousing and managing the collateral of the entities (including VIEs), entering into insurance transactions with VIEs. Interest holders in the VIEs generally have recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to AIG, except, in limited circumstances, when AIG has provided a guarantee to the VIEs’ interest holders.     Under FIN 46(R), AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the party that either (i) absorbs a majority of the VIE’s expected losses; (ii) receives a majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns; or (iii) both. For a further discussion of AIG’s involvement with VIEs, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Outlook     General disruptions in the global equity and credit markets and the liquidity issues at AIG have negatively affected the results of each of AIG’s operating segments as discussed below. As AIG implements the proposed transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and executes its plans for repaying the FRBNY Facility, AIG expects to incur significant additional restructuring-related charges, such as accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset and, potentially,    88    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     the write-off of intangible assets. Further, if AIG continues to incur losses in its businesses, AIG may need to write off material amounts of goodwill and deferred tax assets.     Almost all of AIG’s businesses were adversely affected in the first quarter of 2009 by the criticism and negative publicity that surrounded the payment of retention awards to employees of AIGFP. For a discussion of the effect that continued or renewed criticism or additional negative publicity may have on AIG, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     General Insurance     Although Commercial Insurance has been generally successful in retaining clients, some have reduced the number of lines or limits of coverage due in part to concerns over AIG’s financial strength. In addition, the number of new business opportunities has declined since September 2008 and the negative publicity concerning AIG has made soliciting new business more difficult. Senior management has spent considerable time since September 2008 meeting with policyholders and brokers explaining the financial strength of Commercial Insurance and the protections afforded policyholders by insurance regulations. Nevertheless, net premiums written declined 18 percent in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period of 2008. The retention of existing business continues to be moderately lower than in the comparable prior year period; however, retention levels have shown improvement since the end of the first quarter of 2009.     Overall, rates in Commercial Insurance were essentially flat in early 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. The stabilization of rates is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2008 and reflects the offsetting effects of downward pressure on premiums from the current recessionary environment and the recent introduction of new competitors in the marketplace, and the upward pressure on premiums from the combination of investment and underwriting losses suffered by the commercial insurance industry.     AIG expects that the current recessionary environment will continue to affect United Guaranty Corporation’s (UGC) operating results for the foreseeable future and will result in a significant operating loss for UGC in 2009.     For second quarter 2009, Foreign General Insurance expects to be able to maintain solid client retention rates and underwriting results. However, de-risking by some customers and the economic downturn will continue to adversely affect Foreign General’s net premiums written, primarily through a decline in new business production. Conversely, Foreign General should also benefit from the trend of customers de-risking from other providers. In the Far East operations, where April is the critical renewal period, the second quarter production is consistent with the first months of this year which was affected by the major deterioration in auto sales coupled with reduction in leisure travel. Although Foreign General continues to face challenges in commercial lines, particularly in the U.K./Ireland and Europe regions, due to increased competition and worldwide credit related insurance exposures, its traditional capabilities of servicing its customers, innovation and claims paying ability continue to attract new accounts. Foreign General remains committed to underwriting for profit and continues to examine all risk rating, coverage adequacy and rate improvement, particularly in the financial institutions sector.     On March 2, 2009, AIG announced that it intends to form a General Insurance holding company, including its Commercial Insurance Group, Foreign General unit, and other property and casualty operations (AIU Holdings), with a board of directors, management team and brand distinct from AIG. The establishment of this holding company will assist AIG in preparing for the potential sale of a minority stake in this business. On April 21, 2009, AIG announced that it will transfer this business to an SPV in return for preferred and common interests in the SPV. AIG also intends to purchase from AIU Holdings its equity interests in ILFC, UGC and Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), to clarify the businesses of AIU Holdings.     Life Insurance & Retirement Services     AIG expects that criticism and negative publicity about AIG during the first quarter of 2009 and AIG’s previously announced asset disposition plan will continue to adversely affect Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating results in 2009, specifically net investment income, deferred policy acquisition costs and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization and net realized capital gains (losses). In addition, AIG’s issues have affected certain operations through higher surrender activity, primarily in the U.S. domestic retirement fixed annuity business and    89    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     foreign investment-oriented and retirement products. While surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid-September of 2008, they continue to be higher than historic levels in certain products and countries. and AIG expects surrender activity to continue to be volatile.     These uncertainties, together with rating agency downgrades, have resulted in significantly reduced levels of new sales activity, particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical. Sales of investment-oriented and retirement services products have also declined due to the general decline in the equity markets. New sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels until the uncertainties relating to AIG are resolved.     On March 2, 2009, AIG and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced their intent to enter into transactions pursuant to which AIG will transfer to the FRBNY preferred equity interests in newly-formed SPVs. Each SPV will hold (directly or indirectly) 100 percent of the common stock of AIA in one case and ALICO in the other. In exchange for the preferred equity interests received by the FRBNY, there would be a concurrent substantial reduction in the outstanding balance and maximum available amount to be borrowed on the FRBNY Facility. AIG will hold the common interests in the SPVs. Divestiture options for AIA and ALICO are being reviewed.     Financial Services     AIGFP began unwinding its businesses and portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2008, and these activities are expected to continue beyond 2009. In connection with these activities, AIGFP has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate “books,” and has developed a plan for addressing each book, including each book’s risks, risk mitigation options, monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes. Each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of AIG. The plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve, and they contemplate, depending on the book in question, alternative strategies, including sales, assignments or other transfers of positions, terminations of positions, and/or run-offs of positions in accordance with existing terms. Execution of the plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving increasingly senior members of AIGFP’s and AIG’s respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences. Successful execution of the plans is subject, to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book, to market conditions and, in many circumstances, counterparty negotiation and agreement.     As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses. AIGFP has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio, including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs in connection with the Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) transaction, a sale of its commodity index business, termination of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker, and sale and other disposition of the large majority of its energy/infrastructure investment portfolio. Due to the long-term duration of many of AIGFP’s derivative contracts and to the complexity of AIGFP’s portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIGFP’s control, including market conditions, AIGFP’s access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.     Asset Management     Distressed global markets have caused a significant decline in the value of assets under management, translating to lower base management fees and reduced carried interest revenues for Asset Management operations. Tight credit markets have put pressure on the commercial and residential real estate markets, which has caused values in certain geographic locations to decline, resulting in impairment charges on real estate held for investment purposes. These market conditions have also adversely affected the ability to pay or refinance maturing debt obligations in the private equity and real estate portfolios.     The criticism and negative publicity about AIG following the events of September 2008 and challenging market conditions have contributed to the loss of institutional and retail clients as well as significant redemptions    90    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     from certain of AIG’s managed hedge and mutual funds. Client losses and redemptions have leveled off from the fourth quarter of 2008 as markets have begun to show signs of stabilization in the later part of the first quarter of 2009. AIG’s third party Institutional Asset Management business is not expected to launch any new funds or products prior to its divestiture from AIG.     Within the Spread-Based Investment business, distressed markets have resulted in continued loss of value of AIG’s invested assets.     Results of Operations     AIG identifies its operating segments by product line, consistent with its management structure. These segments are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG’s Other category consists of items not allocated to AIG’s operating segments.     AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG’s Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals.     Consolidated Results     AIG’s consolidated results of operations were as follows:                                                      Three Months Ended        Percentage            March 31,       Increase /            2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions, except per share data)            Revenues:                               Premiums and other considerations      $   18,820       $   20,672         (9   )%      Net investment income        2,283         4,954         (54   )      Net realized capital losses        (3,102   )       (6,089   )       —        Unrealized market valuation losses on AIGFP super senior credit default swap Portfolio        (452   )       (9,107   )       —        Other income        2,909         3,601         (19   )                                  Total revenues        20,458         14,031         46                                    Benefits, claims and expenses:                               Policyholder benefits and claims incurred        16,043         15,882         1        Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses        5,294         5,612         (6   )      Interest expense        2,845         1,272         124        Restructuring expenses and related asset impairment and other expenses        362         —         —        Other expenses        2,282         2,529         (10   )                                  Total benefits, claims and expenses        26,826         25,295         6                                    Loss before income tax benefit        (6,368   )       (11,264   )       —        Income tax benefit        (1,235   )       (3,537   )       —                                    Net loss        (5,133   )       (7,727   )       —        Less: Net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest        (780   )       78         —                                    Net loss attributable to AIG      $   (4,353   )     $   (7,805   )       —   %                                    91    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Premiums and Other Considerations     Premiums and other considerations decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:              •   A decrease of $456 million primarily due to declines in renewal rates and new business in Commercial Insurance and Personal Lines;         •   a decrease of $414 million in Foreign General Insurance mainly due to the sale of the Brazilian operations in the fourth quarter of 2008, a weaker U.S. dollar, production declines in the United Kingdom and Far East regions, and the global economic downturn;         •   a decrease in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services of $507 million primarily due to the sale of the Brazilian operations in the fourth quarter of 2008, a decline in lending activity, which negatively affected the credit business in Europe and equity market declines, which negatively affected the variable annuity business in the U.K. and the investment-oriented products, particularly in Asia; and         •   a decrease in Domestic Life Insurance of $405 million as negative AIG publicity continued to affect sales, particularly for payout annuities.       Net Investment Income     The components of consolidated net investment income were as follows:                                                                  Percentage                        Increase         Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Fixed maturities, including short-term investments      $   3,012       $   5,473         (45   )%      Equity securities        84         70         20        Interest on mortgage and other loans        403         378         7        Partnerships        (686   )       106         —        Mutual funds        (100   )       (145   )       —        Trading account losses        (38   )       (88   )       —        Other investments        149         199         (25   )                                  Total investment income before policyholder income and trading gains (losses)        2,824         5,993         (53   )      Policyholder investment income and trading losses        (307   )       (785   )       —                                    Total investment income        2,517         5,208         (52   )      Investment expenses        234         254         (8   )                                  Net investment income      $   2,283       $   4,954         (54   )%                                     Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to:              •   losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML III of approximately $1.9 billion in 2009, reported in fixed maturities and reflected in the Other category in AIG’s segment results;         •   losses from partnership investments reflecting significantly weaker market conditions in 2009 than in 2008;         •   lower levels of invested assets in 2009 compared to 2008; and         •   the lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments for liquidity purposes.       The decline was partially offset by lower policyholder investment income and trading losses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services (together, policyholder trading losses), which were $295 million for the three    92    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     months ended March 31, 2009 compared to $762 million for the same period last year. Policyholder trading losses are offset by a change in policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets, principally in Japan and Asia.     Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008           (In millions)            Sales of fixed maturity securities      $   (80   )     $   19        Sales of equity securities        (34   )       80        Sales of real estate and other assets        (40   )       153        Other-than-temporary impairments:                       Severity        (1,765   )       (4,105   )      Lack of intent to hold to recovery        (791   )       (779   )      Foreign currency declines        (166   )       (401   )      Issuer-specific credit events        (1,120   )       (171   )      Adverse projected cash flows on structured securities        (145   )       (137   )      Foreign exchange transactions        285         (664   )      Derivative instruments        754         (84   )                          Total      $   (3,102   )     $   (6,089   )                             Net realized capital losses decreased $3.0 billion in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.6 billion primarily related to certain residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and other structured securities as well as the favorable effect of foreign exchange transactions of $949 million.     See Investments — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.     Unrealized Market Valuation Losses on AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio     The unrealized market valuation losses on AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 largely because of the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 associated with the ML III transaction. Changes in fair value of AIG’s interest in ML III are recorded in Net investment income. See Financial Services Operations — Capital Markets Results; Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities; Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Other Income (Loss)     Other Income (loss) decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower partnership income related to the Spread-Based Investment Business and a decline in Institutional Asset Management revenues.     Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred     Policyholder benefits and claims incurred of $16.0 billion for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was essentially unchanged from the same period in 2008.     Policy Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses     Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a $294 million decrease in General Insurance expenses reflecting a decline in production levels. Life Insurance & Retirement Services policy acquisition and other    93    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     insurance expenses increased by $96 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to higher deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) unlockings of $377 million related to changes in the long-term separate account growth rate assumption for Domestic Retirement Services and restructuring costs, partially offset by a higher DAC benefit of $414 million related to net realized capital losses.     Interest Expense     Interest expense increased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to $1.53 billion of interest expense on the FRBNY Facility which was comprised of $822 million of amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset and $708 million of accrued compounding interest. These amounts are reflected in the Other category in AIG’s segment results.     Restructuring Expenses and Related Asset Impairment and Other Expenses     In the fourth quarter of 2008, AIG commenced an organization-wide restructuring plan under which some of its businesses will be divested, some will be held for later divestiture, and some businesses will be prepared for potential offerings to the public. In connection with activities under this plan, AIG recorded restructuring and separation expenses of $362 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, consisting of severance expenses of $38 million, contract termination expenses of $20 million, asset write-downs of $11 million, other exit expenses of $135 million and separation expenses of $158 million.     Other exit expenses primarily include consulting and other professional fees related to (i) asset disposition activities, (ii) AIG’s debt and capital restructuring program with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury and (iii) unwinding of AIGFP’s businesses and portfolios.     Severance and separation expenses described above include retention awards of $162 million to key employees to maintain ongoing business operations and facilitate the successful execution of the restructuring and asset disposition plan. The awards under these retention plans were granted in 2008 and are accrued ratably over the future service periods, which range from 2008 to 2011. The total amount expected to be incurred related to these 2008 retention plans is approximately $1.1 billion. AIG made payments to the employees under these plans in 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 and expects to make further payments for the remainder of 2009 through 2011. The ultimate amount paid could be less primarily due to the effect of forfeitures.     Amounts charged to expense, and expected to be charged to expense, and the total amounts expected to be incurred under the 2008 retention plans, by operating segment, are as follows:                                                                                          General        Life Insurance &        Financial        Asset                        Insurance       Retirement Services       Services       Management       Other       Total           (In millions)            Amounts charged to expense:                                                       Three months ended March 31, 2009      $   42       $   45       $   58       $   10       $   7       $   162        Cumulative incurred since inception        143         97         295         56         63         654                                                            Amounts expected to be incurred in future periods:                                                       Remainder of 2009        111         95         144         17         37         404        2010        —         17         —         —         2         19        2011        —         1         —         —         —         1        Total amounts expected to be incurred in future periods        111         113         144         17         39         424                                                            Total amounts expected to be incurred      $   254       $   210       $   439       $   73       $   102       $   1,078                                                               Total restructuring and separation expenses could have a material effect on future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.     See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses.    94    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Other Expenses     Other Expenses decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in compensation-related costs in the Financial Services and Asset Management segments as well as in the Parent company.     Income Taxes (Benefits)     The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was 19.4 percent. The effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to a $1.6 billion increase in the valuation allowance against a portion of AIG’s deferred tax assets, partially offset by $587 million of deferred tax benefits mainly attributable to the book to tax basis differences of AIG parent’s investment in subsidiaries and other discrete items.     Realization of the deferred tax asset depends on AIG’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating losses and deductible temporary differences were incurred. AIG assessed its ability to realize its deferred tax asset of $36.8 billion and concluded a $22.5 billion valuation allowance was required to reduce the deferred tax asset to $14.3 billion, which is an amount AIG believes is more likely than not to be realized. This compares to a net deferred tax asset of $11.0 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase in the net deferred tax asset of $3.3 billion includes $1.6 billion of deferred taxes attributable to Other comprehensive loss. The remaining increase results from the tax benefit of $3.3 billion on the operating loss offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $1.6 billion. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding deferred tax asset realization. For a discussion of the risks associated with the realization of AIG’s deferred tax assets, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2008 was 31.4 percent. The effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to $703 million of tax charges comprised of increases in the reserves for uncertain tax positions and other discrete period items.    95    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Segment Results                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008           (In millions)            Total Revenues(a)(b):                       General Insurance      $   10,692       $   12,289        Life Insurance & Retirement Services        8,857         8,752        Financial Services(c)(d)        1,273         (6,560   )      Asset Management        299         (149   )      Other        (40   )       (128   )      Consolidation and eliminations        (623   )       (173   )                          Total        20,458         14,031                            Net realized capital gains (losses)(a)(b):                       General Insurance        (447   )       (273   )      Life Insurance & Retirement Services        (3,108   )       (4,369   )      Financial Services(c)        (34   )       (151   )      Asset Management        (152   )       (1,405   )      Other        639         109                            Total        (3,102   )       (6,089   )                          Operating Income (loss)(a)(b):                       General Insurance        (1   )       1,337        Life Insurance & Retirement Services        (1,873   )       (1,831   )      Financial Services(c)(d)        (1,122   )       (8,772   )      Asset Management        (633   )       (1,251   )      Other        (2,348   )       (768   )      Consolidation and eliminations        (391   )       21                            Total      $   (6,368   )     $   (11,264   )                                       (a)    Includes gains (losses) from hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), including the related foreign exchange gains and losses.

General Insurance Operations     AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad.     Commercial Insurance writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Commercial Insurance the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Commercial Insurance without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit Commercial Insurance to accept a risk.    96    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Transatlantic subsidiaries offer reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis both in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk.     AIG’s Personal Lines operations provide automobile insurance through 21st Century Insurance Group, its direct marketing distribution channel, and the Agency Auto Division, its independent agent/broker distribution channel. Personal Lines also provides a broad range of coverages for high net worth individuals through the AIG Private Client Group (Private Client Group). Coverages for the Personal Lines operations are written predominantly in the United States. AIG has entered into a contract to sell 21st Century Insurance Group (excluding the Private Client Group) to the Farmers Group, Inc.     The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, that covers the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to four-family residences.     AIG’s Foreign General Insurance Group writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance which is primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General Insurance Group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries.    97    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       General Insurance Results     General Insurance operating income is comprised of statutory underwriting profit (loss), changes in DAC, net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses.

General Insurance reported an operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to operating income in the same period in 2008 due to an underwriting loss and a decline in net investment income as well as increased net realized capital losses. The combined ratio for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 increased to 102.0, an increase of 5.6 points compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the loss ratio of 6.2 points. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was 5.8 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the three-month period ended March 31, 2008. Increases in Mortgage Guaranty losses accounted for 4.5 points of the increase in the 2009 accident year loss ratio. The loss ratio also increased for other property and casualty lines due to premium rate decreases and changes in loss trends. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $64 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 and reduced incurred losses by $127 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2008. The net adverse development for 2009 includes $100 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies compared to $339 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies in the same period in 2008. The favorable development related to loss sensitive policies had no effect on underwriting profit as it was entirely offset by a reduction in earned premiums. However, given the reduction in earned premiums, there was an increase in the loss ratio of 0.6 points compared to the same period of 2008 related to loss sensitive policies.     General Insurance net premiums written declined $2.1 billion in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as the construction, environmental and transportation lines of business were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects, and workers’ compensation premiums also declined. Net premiums written were also adversely affected by the negative AIG publicity. Foreign General Insurance net premiums written declined mainly due to the sale of the Brazilian operations.    99    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results for further discussion on Net investment income and Realized capital gains (losses).     Commercial Insurance Results     Commercial Insurance operating income decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to significant declines in net investment income and underwriting results, as well as significantly greater net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009. The decline in underwriting results is also reflected in the combined ratio, which increased 3.7 points in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was 0.3 points higher than the loss ratio recorded in the three-month period ended March 31, 2008 for accident year 2008 recorded in 2008. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $148 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 and reduced incurred losses by $217 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2008. The net adverse development for 2009 includes the favorable development related to loss sensitive policies described above.     Commercial Insurance net premiums written declined in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to declines in workers’ compensation premiums and the construction, environmental and transportation lines of businesses as described above. Net premiums written were also adversely affected by the negative AIG publicity.     Mortgage Guaranty Results     Mortgage Guaranty operating losses increased for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to tightening credit markets, declining housing values and increasing mortgage foreclosures. The domestic first-lien operating loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 increased $239 million from the same period in 2008 to $404 million while the second-lien operating loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 of $37 million, which includes the release of the remaining $222 million premium deficiency reserve, decreased $154 million compared to the same period in 2008.     During 2008, UGC tightened underwriting guidelines and increased premium rates for its first-lien business, ceased insuring second-lien business as of September 30, 2008 and during the fourth quarter of 2008 ceased insuring new private student loan business and suspended insuring new business throughout its European operations. All of these actions were in response to the worsening conditions in the global housing markets and resulted in a significant decline in new business written during the second half of 2008 and the first three months of 2009.     Net premiums written declined in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. First-lien and international businesses net premiums written declined 6 percent and 29 percent, respectively, primarily due to tightening market conditions and underwriting standards in the first-lien business and the decision to suspend insuring new business throughout Europe in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, new insurance written, which is a measure of the amount of new insurance added to the portfolio, decreased 80 percent and 83 percent for first-lien and international business, respectively, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.     Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred increased $344 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to the continuing decline in the domestic housing market. Domestic first-lien losses incurred of $541 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 increased 63 percent compared to the same period in 2008, resulting in a first-lien loss ratio of 342 percent in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to a loss ratio of 204 percent for the same period in 2008. Second-lien losses incurred of $327 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 increased 79 percent compared to the same period in 2008. Increases in both domestic and international losses incurred resulted in an overall loss ratio for Mortgage Guaranty (excluding the second-lien business in run-off) of 294 percent for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to 178 percent for the same period in 2008.    100    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Historically, UGC included all mortgage insurance risks in a single premium deficiency test because the manner of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of all Mortgage Guaranty contracts was consistent. With the decision in 2008 to place the second-lien business in run-off, management no longer measures the profitability of the second-lien business in the same way as UGC’s ongoing businesses, and no longer reports loss ratio or expense ratio information for the second-lien business. As a result, UGC performs a separate premium deficiency calculation for the second-lien business.     At March 31, 2009, the present value of expected second-lien future premiums of $518 million and the already established liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense of $804 million exceeded the present value of expected second-lien future loss and expense payments (net of expected future recoveries) of $1.3 billion resulting in the release of the premium deficiency reserve of $222 million. The second-lien risk in force at March 31, 2009 totaled $2.9 billion compared to $3.7 billion of risk in force at March 31, 2008. The second-lien business is expected to run off over the next 10 to 12 years. Risk in force represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. UGC may record net losses on this business in future periods because the timing of future delinquencies may precede recognition of future premiums.     UGC’s domestic mortgage risk in force totaled $30.0 billion as of March 31, 2009 and the 60+−day delinquency ratio was 8.6 percent (based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice) compared to domestic mortgage risk in force of $31.5 billion and a delinquency ratio of 4.0 percent at March 31, 2008. Approximately 84 percent of the domestic mortgage risk is secured by first-lien, owner-occupied properties.     Foreign General Insurance Results     Foreign General Insurance operating income decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to a decrease in underwriting profit and a decrease in net investment income reflecting lower mutual fund and partnership income related to poor performance in the equity markets. (See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Net Investment Income for further discussion.)     Net premiums written decreased 18 percent (10 percent in original currency) in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, which reflects, in part, the sale of the Brazilian operations. The European region, largely comprised of commercial line business, maintained strong client and policy retention in their most significant renewal period. However, record low car sales in Japan and reduced numbers of overseas travelers worldwide have affected the consumer lines production.     The loss ratio in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 increased 3.8 points compared to the same period in 2008 due to:              •   The loss ratio recorded for accident year 2009 was 3.1 points higher than the loss ratio recorded for accident year 2008 primarily due to significant claim increases in the financial institutions professional indemnity book as a result of stock market declines, credit exposure and potential claims related to the Madoff fraud. Results for Japan were affected by higher claims frequency in accident and travel insurance.         •   Loss development on prior accident years increased the loss ratio by 0.7 points.       The expense ratio increased 3.1 points in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 principally due to additional separation costs.    101    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense     The following table presents the components of the General Insurance gross liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (loss reserves) by major lines of business on a statutory annual statement basis*:                                          March 31,        December 31,            2009       2008           (In millions)            Other liability occurrence      $   19,769       $   19,773        Workers’ compensation        14,639         15,170        Other liability claims made        12,801         13,189        International        11,557         11,786        Auto liability        5,422         5,593        Property        4,487         5,201        Mortgage Guaranty/Credit        4,114         3,137        Reinsurance        3,147         3,102        Products liability        2,276         2,400        Medical malpractice        2,100         2,210        Aircraft        1,504         1,693        Accident and health        1,577         1,451        Commercial multiple peril        1,068         1,163        Fidelity/surety        1,004         1,028        Other        1,940         2,362                            Total      $   87,405       $   89,258                                         *    Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.      AIG’s gross liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves (IBNR) and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are currently reflected in operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.     Estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based upon historical reporting trends. Mortgage Guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability (for each delinquent loan reported) that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency, cure rates, dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan. Because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events, such as changes in home price appreciation or depreciation, interest rates and unemployment, the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans. Consistent with industry practice, AIG does not establish a reserve for insured loans that are not currently delinquent, but that may become delinquent in future periods.     At March 31, 2009, General Insurance net loss reserves decreased $201 million from the prior year-end to $72.25 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.    102    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table classifies the components of the General Insurance net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense by business unit:                                          March 31,        December 31,            2009       2008           (In millions)            Commercial Insurance      $   48,234       $   48,789        Transatlantic        7,355         7,349        Personal Lines        2,352         2,460        Mortgage Guaranty        3,523         3,004        Foreign General Insurance        10,790         10,853                            Total net loss reserves      $   72,254       $   72,455                               Discounting of Reserves     At March 31, 2009, General Insurance net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.57 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in American International Reinsurance Company Limited (AIRCO) that was written by Commercial Insurance is discounted based on the yield of Department of the Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the Commercial Insurance payout pattern for this business. The discount is comprised of the following: $733 million — tabular discount for workers’ compensation in Commercial Insurance; $1.68 billion — non-tabular discount for workers’ compensation in Commercial Insurance; and, $160 million — non-tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO for Commercial Insurance business. Since 1998, AIRCO has assumed on a quota share basis certain general liability and products liability business written by Commercial Insurance, and the reserves for this business are carried on a discounted basis by AIRCO.     Quarterly Reserving Process     AIG believes that the General Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover General Insurance net losses and loss expenses as of March 31, 2009. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s loss reserves as of March 31, 2009. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.    103    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves:                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008           (In millions)            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year      $   72,455       $   69,288        Foreign exchange effect        (290   )       70        Acquisitions and dispositions        (287   )       —                            Losses and loss expenses incurred:                       Current year        7,866         8,021        Prior years, other than accretion of discount        64         (164   )      Prior years, accretion of discount        98         104                            Losses and loss expenses incurred        8,028         7,961                            Losses and loss expenses paid        7,652         6,812                            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period      $   72,254       $   70,507                               The following tables summarize development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years (other than accretion of discount):                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008           (In millions)            Prior Accident Year Development by Reporting Unit:                       Commercial Insurance      $   148       $   (217   )      Personal Lines        4         36        Mortgage Guaranty        (94   )       68        Foreign General Insurance        8         (17   )                          Subtotal        66         (130   )      Transatlantic        (2   )       3        Asbestos settlements        —         (37   )                          Prior years, other than accretion of discount      $   64       $   (164   )                                                                  Calendar Year           2009       2008           (In millions)            Prior Accident Year Development by Accident Year:                       Accident Year                       2008      $   (147   )              2007        115       $   (35   )      2006        (25   )       (178   )      2005        (83   )       (204   )      2004        5         (131   )      2003        4         (24   )      2002 and prior        195         408                            Prior years, other than accretion of discount      $   64       $   (164   )                             In determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center. For example, if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect    104    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the profit center’s reserves for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.     2009 Net Loss Development     In the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, net loss development from prior accident years was adverse by approximately $64 million excluding approximately $98 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. The overall adverse development of $64 million consisted of approximately $131 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2008 offset by approximately $195 million of adverse loss development from accident years 2002 and prior. The adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior was primarily related to excess casualty business and reinsurance, including commutations, within Commercial Insurance. Within Commercial Insurance, the overall adverse development of $148 million included approximately $170 million of adverse development relating to excess casualty business, approximately $80 million of adverse development relating to a surety claim in accident year 2007, approximately $80 million of adverse development relating to reinsurance, including commutations, and approximately $50 million of adverse development relating to property business. Partially offsetting these adverse developments were smaller amounts of favorable developments across other Commercial Insurance casualty profit centers including Lexington Insurance Company’s (Lexington) healthcare and CAT excess businesses, and D&O and related management liability classes of business within AIG Executive Liability. Also included in the Commercial Insurance prior accident year development is approximately $100 million of favorable development relating to loss sensitive business written by the Risk Management Group; however, this favorable development is offset by a corresponding reduction in net premiums earned and thus did not affect underwriting loss in the first quarter of 2009. Mortgage Guaranty reserves from prior accident years developed favorably by approximately $94 million in the first three months of 2009, primarily related to second lien business claims from accident year 2008. Mortgage Guaranty reserves reflect approximately $138 million of favorable development from accident year 2008, partially offset by approximately $44 million of adverse development from earlier accident years, primarily 2007.     2008 Net Loss Development      In the first three months of 2008, net loss development from prior accident years was favorable by approximately $164 million, including approximately $339 million of favorable development relating to loss sensitive business (which was offset by an equal amount of negative earned premium development), and excluding approximately $104 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. Excluding both the favorable development relating to loss sensitive business and accretion of loss reserve discount, net loss development from prior accident years in the first three months of 2008 was adverse by approximately $175 million. The overall favorable development of $164 million consisted of approximately $572 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2007 partially offset by approximately $408 million of adverse loss development from accident years 2002 and prior. Excluding the favorable development from loss sensitive business, the overall adverse development of $175 million consisted of approximately $269 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2007 offset by approximately $444 million of adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior. The adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior was primarily related to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance for the 2000 and prior accident years. The favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2007 included approximately $300 million in favorable development from loss sensitive business written by AIG Risk Management, and approximately $160 million in favorable development from business written by Lexington, including Healthcare, AIG CAT Excess, Casualty and Program business. AIG Executive Liability business contributed approximately $50 million to the favorable development from accident years 2004 and 2005, relating primarily to D&O. Accident year 2007 produced overall favorable development of approximately $35 million, which included approximately $76 million of adverse development from Mortgage    105    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     Guaranty and $18 million of adverse development from Personal Lines, offset by favorable development from most classes of business in Commercial Insurance and from Transatlantic.     Asbestos and Environmental Reserves     The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.     As described more fully in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG’s reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the table that follows. This development was primarily attributable to several large defendants.     A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined appears in the table below. The vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years. The current environmental policies that AIG underwrites on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the table below.                                                                  2009       2008        Three Months Ended March 31,      Gross       Net       Gross       Net           (In millions)            Asbestos:                                       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of period      $   3,443       $   1,200       $   3,864       $   1,454        Losses and loss expenses incurred*        27         12         (29   )       (33   )      Losses and loss expenses paid*        (140   )       (17   )       (237   )       (121   )                                          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period      $   3,330       $   1,195       $   3,598       $   1,300                                            Environmental:                                       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of period      $   417       $   194       $   515       $   237        Losses and loss expenses incurred*        3         —         (5   )       —        Losses and loss expenses paid*        (12   )       (12   )       (14   )       (10   )                                          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period      $   408       $   182       $   496       $   227                                            Combined:                                       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of period      $   3,860       $   1,394       $   4,379       $   1,691        Losses and loss expenses incurred*        30         12         (34   )       (33   )      Losses and loss expenses paid*        (152   )       (29   )       (251   )       (131   )                                          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period      $   3,738       $   1,377       $   4,094       $   1,527                                                         *    All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years, primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior years.     106    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The gross and net IBNR included in the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were estimated as follows:                                                                  2009       2008        Three Months Ended March 31,      Gross       Net       Gross       Net           (In millions)            Asbestos      $   2,246       $   929       $   2,409       $   1,052        Environmental        246         93         344         132                                            Combined      $   2,492       $   1,022       $   2,753       $   1,184                                               A summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity was as follows:                                                                                          2009       2008        Three Months Ended March 31,      Asbestos       Environmental       Combined       Asbestos       Environmental       Combined            Claims at beginning of year        5,780         6,674         12,454         6,563         7,652         14,215        Claims during year:                                                       Opened        232         181         413         198         321         519        Settled        (133   )       (38   )       (171   )       (30   )       (39   )       (69   )      Dismissed or otherwise resolved        (178   )       (289   )       (467   )       (344   )       (669   )       (1,013   )                                                          Claims at end of period        5,701         6,528         12,229         6,387         7,265         13,652                                                               Survival Ratios — Asbestos and Environmental     The following table presents AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at March 31, 2009 and 2008. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The March 31, 2009 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at March 31, 2008 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. In addition, AIG’s survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at March 31, 2009 by approximately 1.1 years and 2.3 years, respectively, and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at March 31, 2008 by approximately 1.6 years and 3.2 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG’s determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.    107    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three-year average payment and were as follows:                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      Gross       Net            2009                       Survival ratios:                       Asbestos        5.0         3.9        Environmental        4.4         3.2        Combined        4.9         3.8        2008                       Survival ratios:                       Asbestos        6.1         4.5        Environmental        4.8         3.6        Combined        5.9         4.3           Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations     AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad.

Total revenues increased slightly in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, due to lower levels of net realized capital losses, partially offset by lower premiums and other considerations and lower net investment income. See Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations, Net Investment Income and Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) for further discussion.     The operating loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 increased slightly compared to the same period in 2008. The operating loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 included DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $558 million in the Domestic Retirement Services operations resulting from a reduction in the separate account long-term growth rate assumption used to determine DAC amortization. In addition, losses on partnership investments, lower yield enhancements and overall lower investment margins resulting from de-risking activities and higher short-term liquidity contributed to the decline over the same period last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues and higher DAC and SIA benefits related to net realized capital losses. The operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 included DAC and SIA benefits of $696 million compared to benefits of $267 million in the same period in 2008.    110    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results     Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services results on a sub-product basis were as follows:                                                                              Premiums and        Net        Net Realized              Operating            Other        Investment        Capital Gains        Total        Income         Three Months Ended March 31,      Considerations       Income       (Losses)       Revenues       (Loss)           (In millions)            2009                                               Life insurance      $   4,344       $   1,187       $   (643   )     $   4,888       $   (58   )      Personal accident        1,775         96         (44   )       1,827         293        Group products        759         45         (67   )       737         16        Individual fixed annuities        10         581         (278   )       313         79        Individual variable annuities        52         (128   )       3         (73   )       4                                                     Total      $   6,940       $   1,781       $   (1,029   )     $   7,692       $   334                                                    2008                                               Life insurance      $   4,512       $   919       $   (567   )     $   4,864       $   231        Personal accident        1,691         92         (40   )       1,743         377        Group products        996         153         (30   )       1,119         89        Individual fixed annuities        129         569         (113   )       585         58        Individual variable annuities        119         (285   )       28         (138   )       (20   )                                                  Total      $   7,447       $   1,448       $   (722   )     $   8,173       $   735                                                    Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                               Life insurance        (4   )%       29   %       —   %       —   %       —   %      Personal accident        5         4         —         5         (22   )      Group products        (24   )       (71   )       —         (34   )       (82   )      Individual fixed annuities        (92   )       2         —         (46   )       36        Individual variable annuities        (56   )       —         —         —         —                                                    Total        (7   )%       23   %       —   %       (6   )%       (55   )%                                                     AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies and therefore premiums and other considerations reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and changes in foreign currency translation rates.     The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services premiums and other considerations:                                       Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008            Growth in original currency*        (7.3   )%       6.8   %      Foreign exchange effect        0.5         5.8                            Growth as reported in U.S. dollars        (6.8   )%       12.6   %                                       *    Computed using a constant exchange rate each period.      Total revenues for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 decreased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower premiums and other considerations, the effect of the sale of the Brazil operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 and higher net realized capital losses. See Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).     Operating income in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 decreased compared to the same period in 2008 due to:              •   higher net realized capital losses;      111    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   lower investment margins due to de-risking activities and higher short-term liquidity;         •   lower assets under management in the U.K., Japan and other investment-linked portfolios; and         •   higher expenses due to restructuring charges.       Partially offsetting these items were higher DAC and SIA benefits of $333 million related to the net realized capital losses.

First year premium sales in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 declined compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to decreases in life insurance and personal accident sales. Life insurance sales in Asia declined due to the effect of equity market performance on investment-linked products and the negative effect of foreign exchange. This decline more than offset the increase in Japan life insurance sales resulting from sales incentives and the positive effect of foreign exchange.     Single premium sales in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 declined significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower guaranteed income bond deposits in the U.K. resulting from poor market conditions and the effect of the adverse publicity surrounding AIG. Single premium sales also decreased in Asia as customers remained concerned about equity markets performance, particularly in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and sales decreased in Europe primarily due to declines in group credit business.     Annuity deposits decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the decline in individual variable annuity deposits. Investment-linked deposits in the U.K. decreased significantly in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 resulting from declines in the U.K. Premier Access Bond product following significant surrender activity as a result of the AIG issues. Adverse publicity surrounding AIG and the planned disposition of AIG’s Japan life operations continued to negatively affect deposits in Japan during the first quarter of 2009 due to the suspension of sales by banks. While some banks in Japan have resumed sales of annuity products, most have not. AIG has, therefore, increased its efforts to sell annuity deposits through agents.    112    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Domestic Life Insurance Results     Domestic Life Insurance results, presented on a sub-product basis, were as follows:                                                                              Premiums and        Net        Net Realized              Operating            Other        Investment        Capital Gains        Total        Income         Three Months Ended March 31,      Considerations       Income       (Losses)       Revenues       (Loss)           (In millions)            2009                                               Life insurance      $   634       $   190       $   (280   )     $   544       $   (255   )      Home service        183         136         (73   )       246         (22   )      Group life/health        201         53         (19   )       235         8        Payout annuities*        149         334         (88   )       395         (28   )      Individual fixed and runoff annuities        15         109         (29   )       95         (11   )                                                  Total      $   1,182       $   822       $   (489   )     $   1,515       $   (308   )                                                  2008                                               Life insurance      $   589       $   373       $   (1,055   )     $   (93   )     $   (839   )      Home service        188         153         (140   )       201         (62   )      Group life/health        204         47         (14   )       237         2        Payout annuities*        594         303         (22   )       875         38        Individual fixed and runoff annuities        12         108         (57   )       63         (9   )                                                  Total      $   1,587       $   984       $   (1,288   )     $   1,283       $   (870   )                                                  Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                               Life insurance        8   %       (49   )%       —   %       —   %       —   %      Home service        (3   )       (11   )       —         22         —        Group life/health        (1   )       13         —         (1   )       300        Payout annuities        (75   )       10         —         (55   )       —        Individual fixed and runoff annuities        25         1         —         51         —                                                    Total        (26   )%       (16   )%       —   %       18   %       —   %                                                               *    Premiums and other considerations include structured settlements, single premium immediate annuities and terminal funding annuities.      Total revenues for Domestic Life Insurance increased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses, partially offset by lower net investment income and lower premiums and other considerations. See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Losses and Investments.     Domestic Life Insurance reported a lower operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due principally to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments. Operating income was adversely affected by lower net investment income due to reduced overall investment yields from increased levels of short-term investments, partnership losses and a current period decline of $81 million in fair value of the economic interest in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II).    113    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Domestic Life Insurance Sales and Deposits(a)     Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits by product(b) were as follows:                                                                  Percentage                        Increase/         Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Life insurance                               Periodic premium by product:                               Universal life      $   14       $   47         (70   )%      Variable universal life        7         21         (67   )      Term life        23         49         (53   )      Whole life/other        —         1         —                                    Total periodic premiums by product        44         118         (63   )      Unscheduled and single deposits        33         55         (40   )                                  Total life insurance        77         173         (55   )                                  Home service                               Life insurance and accident and health        17         20         (15   )      Fixed annuities        56         29         93        Unscheduled and single deposits        4         5         (20   )                                  Total home service        77         54         43                                    Group life/health        34         37         (8   )      Payout annuities        208         573         (64   )      Individual fixed and runoff annuities        195         82         138                                    Total sales and deposits      $   591       $   919         (36   )%                                               (a)    Excludes divested operations.      (b)    Life insurance sales include periodic premium from new business expected to be collected over a one-year period and unscheduled and single premiums from new and existing policyholders. Sales of group accident and health insurance represent annualized first year premium from new policies. Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing policyholders.      Total Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower payout annuities and life insurance premiums, partially offset by an increase in individual fixed annuities sales. Payout annuities sales and life insurance premiums decreased primarily due to AIG’s lower ratings and negative publicity. Individual fixed annuities sales increased as a result of the interest rate environment as credited rates offered were more competitive with the rates offered by banks on certificates of deposit.    114    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Domestic Retirement Services Results     Domestic Retirement Services results, presented on a sub-product basis were as follows:                                                                              Premiums and        Net        Net Realized              Operating            Other        Investment        Capital Gains        Total        (Loss)/         Three Months Ended March 31,      Considerations       Income       (Losses)       Revenues       Income           (In millions)            2009                                               Group retirement products      $   72       $   372       $   (561   )     $   (117   )     $   (469   )      Individual fixed annuities        32         563         (870   )       (275   )       (808   )      Individual variable annuities        105         25         (55   )       75         (524   )      Individual annuities — runoff*        4         67         (104   )       (33   )       (98   )                                                   Total      $   213       $   1,027       $   (1,590   )     $   (350   )     $   (1,899   )                                                  2008                                               Group retirement products      $   107       $   494       $   (740   )     $   (139   )     $   (493   )      Individual fixed annuities        23         759         (1,246   )       (464   )       (956   )      Individual variable annuities        152         35         (252   )       (65   )       (137   )      Individual annuities — runoff*        2         83         (121   )       (36   )       (110   )                                                  Total      $   284       $   1,371       $   (2,359   )     $   (704   )     $   (1,696   )                                                  Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                               Group retirement products        (33   )%       (25   )%       —   %       —   %       —   %      Individual fixed annuities        39         (26   )       —         —         —        Individual variable annuities        (31   )       (29   )       —         —         —        Individual annuities — runoff        100         (19   )       —         —         —                                                    Total        (25   )%       (25   )%       —   %       —   %       —   %                                                               *    Primarily represents runoff annuity business sold through discontinued distribution relationships.      Domestic Retirement Services reported higher operating losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the following:              •   losses on partnership investments principally related to the private equity portfolio;         •   lower yield enhancement income including losses of $148 million related to AIG’s retained economic interest in ML II;         •   increased levels of short-term investments;         •   lower assets under management;         •   DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening due to deteriorating equity market conditions and a reduction in the long-term separate account growth rate assumptions resulting in charges for group retirement products and individual variable annuities of $78 million and $480 million, respectively; and         •   lower DAC and SIA benefits relating to net realized capital losses of $40 million for individual variable annuities.       These decreases were partially offset by lower net realized capital losses principally due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and a $192 million decline in losses from embedded policy derivative liability valuations, net of related economic hedges. In addition, for group retirement products and individual fixed annuities, DAC and SIA benefits relating to net realized capital losses were higher in the three-month period ended    115    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     March 31, 2009 by $109 million and $21 million, respectively, compared to the same period last year.

For individual variable annuities, the decrease is also attributable to the decline in equity markets since March 2008.     Surrender rates and other withdrawals increased for group retirement products and individual variable and fixed annuities in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the ratings downgrades and negative publicity about AIG. However, surrender rates and net flows have improved in all three product lines from the fourth quarter of 2008.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Sales Inducement Assets     DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period in accordance with FAS 60, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises”. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment-type products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts in accordance with FAS 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains from the Sale of Investments.” Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet with DAC and amortized over the life of the business similar to DAC. AIG offers sales inducements to   117    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contracts. Sales inducements are recognized as an asset (SIA) with a corresponding increase to the liability for policyholder contract deposits on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the life of the contract similar to DAC. The deferral of acquisition and sales inducement costs decreased $323 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to declines in new business production. The current year amortization includes a $696 million increase to operating income related to net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to $267 million in the same period in 2008. Current year amortization for Domestic Retirement Services also includes charges for DAC and SIA unlocking of $412 million related to a reduction in the long-term separate account growth rate assumption. Annualized amortization expense levels in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately 13 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of the opening DAC balance.     The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC/VOBA and SIA:                                                                                          2009       2008        Three Months Ended March 31,      DAC/VOBA       SIA       Total       DAC/VOBA       SIA       Total           (In millions)            Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services                                                       Balance at beginning of year      $   26,166       $    317       $   26,483       $   26,175       $   681       $   26,856        Acquisition costs deferred        1,231         12         1,243         1,344         33         1,377        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income        (799   )       (17   )       (816   )       (898   )       (28   )       (926   )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities        (276   )       —         (276   )       (86   )       (1   )       (87   )      Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange        (651   )       (7   )       (658   )       980         —         980        Other*        (11   )       1         (10   )       (1,145   )       (299   )       (1,444   )                                                          Balance at end of period      $   25,660       $    306       $   25,966       $   26,370       $   386       $   26,756                                                            Domestic Life Insurance                                                       Balance at beginning of year      $    7,236       $    66       $   7,302       $   6,432       $   53       $   6,485        Acquisition costs deferred        145         4         149         219         5         224        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income        (170   )       (3   )       (173   )       (133   )       (1   )       (134   )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities        (6   )       —         (6   )       94         —         94        Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange        (14   )       —         (14   )       (23   )       —         (23   )      Other        —         (2   )       (2   )       —         —         —                                                            Balance at end of period      $    7,191       $    65       $   7,256       $   6,589       $   57       $   6,646                                                            Domestic Retirement Services                                                       Balance at beginning of year      $    7,211       $   1,415       $   8,626       $   5,838       $   991       $   6,829        Acquisition costs deferred        137         41         178         239         53         292        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income        (293   )       (46   )       (339   )       —         —         —        Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities        (497   )       (98   )       (595   )       69         29         98        Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange        (1   )       —         (1   )       1         —         1                                                            Balance at end of period      $    6,557       $   1,312       $   7,869       $   6,147       $   1,073       $   7,220                                                            Total Life Insurance & Retirement Services                                                       Balance at beginning of year      $   40,613       $   1,798       $   42,411       $   38,445       $   1,725       $   40,170        Acquisition costs deferred        1,513         57         1,570         1,802         91         1,893        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income        (1,262   )       (66   )       (1,328   )       (1,031   )       (29   )       (1,060   )      118    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                                                                                          2009       2008        Three Months Ended March 31,      DAC/VOBA       SIA       Total       DAC/VOBA       SIA       Total           (In millions)            Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities        (779   )       (98   )       (877   )       77         28         105        Increase due to foreign exchange        (666   )       (7   )       (673   )       958         —         958        Other*        (11   )       (1   )       (12   )       (1,145   )       (299   )       (1,444   )                                                          Balance at end of period      $   39,408       $   1,683       $   41,091       $   39,106       $   1,516       $   40,622                                                                         *    In 2008, primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of FAS 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (FAS 159).      As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC, VOBA and SIA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.     DAC, VOBA and SIA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG’s DAC, VOBA and SIA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG’s results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.     Financial Services Operations     AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital markets, and consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations.     Aircraft Leasing     AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC’s own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.     Capital Markets     Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and engages in borrowing activities that involve issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into GIAs. Given the extreme market conditions experienced in 2008, downgrades of AIG’s credit ratings by the rating agencies and AIG’s intent to refocus on its core businesses, in late 2008 AIGFP began to unwind its businesses and portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities.     Historically, AIG’s Capital Markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. AIGFP has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. Revenues and operating income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities and by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the comparative period.   119    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Consumer Finance     AIG’s Consumer Finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives most of its revenues from finance charges assessed on real estate loans, secured and unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables.     AIG’s foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. AIGCFG has operations in Argentina, China, Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Taiwan, Thailand, India and Colombia. Through April 15, 2009, AIG has completed the sale of certain AIGCFG businesses in Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines.

The operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was partially offset by a gain of $1.8 billion representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities, including $106 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on the super senior credit default swaps. AGF’s operating income declined in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to increases in the provision for finance receivable losses of $186 million resulting from increases to the allowance for finance receivable losses in response to the higher levels of delinquencies on AGF’s finance receivable portfolio and higher net charge-offs.     ILFC generated strong operating income growth in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, driven to a large extent by a larger aircraft fleet and lower composite borrowing rates.     Capital Markets Results     AIGFP’s operating loss decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily related to a reduced valuation loss on its super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio and the positive effect related to credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. AIGFP’s results reflect the effects of its wind-down activities.    120    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $452 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to $9.1 billion in 2008, representing the change in fair value of its super senior credit default swap portfolio. The principal components of the valuation losses recognized were as follows:              •   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $809 million in the first quarter of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to $8.0 billion for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the unrealized market valuation loss on this portfolio was largely due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of CDS contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 in connection with the ML III transaction.         •   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $358 million in the first quarter of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $896 million for the same period in 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, the valuation of these contracts benefited from the narrowing of corporate credit spreads, while these spreads widened during the same period in 2008.       See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio.     During the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, AIGFP recognized a loss of $224 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio, compared to a net loss of $57 million in the same period of 2008.     The following table presents AIGFP’s credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) (excluding intercompany transactions):                                            Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets       AIG’s Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       (In millions)            Three Months Ended March 31, 2009                           Trading securities      $   (1,131   )     Term notes     $   644        Loans and other assets        (48   )     Hybrid term notes       604        Derivative assets        441       GIAs       451                   Other liabilities       104                   Derivative liabilities*       722                                Decrease in assets      $   (738   )     Decrease in liabilities     $   2,525                                Net pre-tax increase to other income      $   1,787                                            Three Months Ended March 31, 2008                           Trading securities      $   (2,148   )     Term notes     $   261        Loans and other assets        (24   )     Hybrid term notes       662        Derivative assets        (448   )     GIAs       1,156                   Other liabilities       30                   Derivative liabilities*       539                                Decrease in assets      $   (2,620   )     Decrease in liabilities     $   2,648                                Net pre-tax increase to other income      $   28                                                         *    Includes super senior credit default swap portfolio.      AIGFP’s operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 includes a gain of $1.8 billion representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities, including $106 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. The gain in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily the result of significant widening in AIG’s credit spreads since    121    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     December 31, 2008. This was partially offset by continued widening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant segment of AIGFP’s investment portfolio. Included in the first quarter 2008 net operating loss is the transition gain of $291 million related to the adoption of FAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” and FAS 159.     Included in AIGFP’s financial results for the first quarter of 2009 is $933 million of interest charges on intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation.     Historically, the most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses was compensation, which was approximately $143 million, or 77 percent of operating expense in the first three months of 2008. For 2009, however, compensation expense was approximately $27 million, or only 17 percent of operating expenses. In addition, AIGFP recognized $44 million in expenses related to pre-existing retention plans that were reported as part of restructuring expenses.     Asset Management Operations     AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products. These services and products are offered to individuals, pension funds and institutions (including AIG subsidiaries) globally through AIG’s Spread-Based Investment business, Institutional Asset Management, and Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds businesses. Also included in Asset Management operations are the results of certain SunAmerica sponsored partnership investments.     The revenues and operating income (loss) for this segment are affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets. In addition, net realized gains and carried interest are contingent upon investment maturity levels and market conditions. In the Institutional Asset Management business, carried interest, computed in accordance with each fund’s governing agreement, is based on the investment’s performance over the life of each fund. Unrealized carried interest is recognized based on each fund’s performance as of the balance sheet date. Future fund performance may negatively affect previously recognized carried interest.     AIG expects to divest its Institutional Asset Management businesses consisting of investment services that are offered to external party clients. The businesses offered for sale exclude those investment services providing traditional fixed income and shorter duration asset and liability management for AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries as well as proprietary real estate and private equity investments and the MIP. AIG expects to continue relationships with the divested businesses for other investment management services used by those insurance company subsidiaries.     See the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the Asset Management businesses.    122    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Asset Management Results     Asset Management results were as follows:                                                                  Percentage                        Increase         Three Months Ended March 31,      2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Revenues:                               Spread-Based Investment business      $   (115   )     $   (809   )       —   %      Institutional Asset Management        332         524         (37   )      Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds        46         74         (38   )      Other Asset Management        36         62         (42   )                                  Total      $   299       $   (149   )       —   %                                  Operating income (loss):                               Spread-Based Investment business      $   (359   )     $   (1,251   )       —   %      Institutional Asset Management        (310   )       (78   )       —        Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds        —         19         —        Other Asset Management        36         59         (39   )                                  Total      $   (633   )     $   (1,251   )       —   %                                     Asset Management recognized lower operating losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to higher foreign exchange gains on GIC liabilities; net gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting; and the positive effect of tightening corporate credit spreads on credit default swap investments. Offsetting these improvements were lower partnership income, higher equity losses due to impairments on real estate investments, lower unrealized net carried interest revenues, and an allowance for credit losses recognized on loan investments held by the MIP. Other-than temporary impairments for the Spread-Based Investment business increased marginally as increases in the MIP were offset by decreases in the GIC. Restructuring-related expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2009 for the Asset Management segment were $15 million.     The $633 million operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 includes approximately $600 million in net operating losses related to businesses which are expected to be retained by AIG, including the MIP and proprietary real estate and private equity investment strategies.     Spread-Based Investment Business Results     The Spread-Based Investment business reported significantly lower operating losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower net realized capital losses, accretion income on investments held in the MIP of $49 million and lower funding costs in the GIC business. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in income from partnership investments held in the GIC, which decreased $185 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to weaker market conditions in 2009.     Net realized capital losses, composed primarily of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed income securities, were $405 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2008. The decrease in net realized capital losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 primarily consists of an increase of approximately $615 million in net foreign exchange gains on foreign-denominated GIC reserves and MIP liabilities, fair value gains of $154 million on credit default swap investments held by the MIP due to the tightening of corporate credit spreads and fair value gains on interest rate and foreign exchange hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting treatments for both the GIC and MIP of $401 million. These increases were partially offset by an increased allowance for credit loss recorded on bank loan and commercial mortgage investments of the MIP and lower gains on the sales of securities.     AIG enters into derivative arrangements to hedge the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs. Some of    123    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     these hedging relationships do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore creates volatility in operating results despite being effective economic hedges.     The other-than-temporary impairment charges on fixed maturity securities held in the GIC declined during the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 due to the reduction in assets resulting from the termination of the U.S. securities lending program in December 2008. The other-than-temporary impairment charges on fixed maturity securities held in the MIP increased during the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 primarily due to credit losses and severity write-downs on structured fixed income investments. The decline in impairments in the GIC was largely offset by the increased impairments in the MIP. See Investments — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.     The GIC program is in runoff with no new GICs issued subsequent to 2005. The anticipated runoff of the domestic GIC portfolio was as follows:                                                                              Less Than        1-3        3 +−5        Over Five               At March 31, 2009      One Year       Years       Years       Years       Total           (In billions)            Domestic GICs      $   3.4       $   2.7       $   2.3       $   3.7       $   12.1           Contractual maturities of debt issued under the MIP was as follows:                                                                              Less Than        1-3        3 +−5        Over Five               At March 31, 2009      One Year       Years       Years       Years       Total           (In billions)            MIP liabilities      $   1.2       $   7.3       $   1.2       $   4.3       $   14.0           The GIC and MIP both invest in various fixed income asset classes which include corporate debt, both public and private, and structured fixed income consisting of RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and CDOs. The majority of these investments are currently rated investment grade. In addition, the GIC and the MIP invests in bank loans, commercial mortgage loans and single name credit default swaps. The GIC invests in limited partnership (or equivalent) interests in private equity and hedge funds, but the MIP does not.     Institutional Asset Management Results     Institutional Asset Management recognized an increased operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily resulting from:              •   impairments on proprietary real estate investments and losses on equity investments in real estate joint ventures of $292 million due to significant dislocation in the real estate markets in which properties are held;         •   lower unrealized carried interest revenues of $108 million reflecting declines in portfolio asset valuations, primarily in private equity;         •   lower base management fees from external clients of $41 million due to lower average assets under management;         •   $53 million of operating losses on consolidated private equity investments originally acquired for the purpose of transfer to third-party funds which were not able to be sold or otherwise divested as originally contemplated (such assets are now considered proprietary investments of the Institutional Asset Management business); and         •   $21 million in impairment charges recognized on strategic equity investments.       Offsetting these declines were net realized capital gains on written credit default swaps of $316 million. These net gains were due to the widening of AIG’s credit spreads.     AIG’s unaffiliated client assets under management, including retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, were $63.5 billion, $68.9 billion and $94.6 billion at March 31, 2009, December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2008, respectively. The decline from December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2008 reflects lower asset values due to the significant deterioration in the credit and equity markets during 2008 as well as the effect of net client outflows.    124    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds     Revenues and operating income related to Brokerage Services and Mutual Fund activities decreased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 from the same period in 2008 due to lower fee income as a result of a lower asset base and a decline in commission income resulting from difficult market conditions.     Other Asset Management Results     Revenues and operating income related to Other Asset Management activities declined in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 from the same period in 2008, due to changes in partnership income driven by weaker market conditions in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009.     Other Operations     Other operations operating loss in the three months ended March 31, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML III of $1.9 billion and increased interest expense on the FRBNY Facility, partially offset by interest income on intercompany loans.     Critical Accounting Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers that its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of AIG’s ability to continue as a going concern, liability for general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts, recoverability of DAC, estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products, the allowance for finance receivable losses, flight equipment recoverability, other-than-temporary impairments, goodwill impairment, estimates with respect to income taxes and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps and AIG’s economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III (Maiden Lane Interests). These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s results of operations would be directly affected.     The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below.              •   AIG’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern       When assessing AIG’s ability to continue as a going concern, management must make judgments and estimates about the following:              •   the marketability of assets to be disposed of and the timing and amount of related cash proceeds to be used to repay indebtedness;         •   the planned sales of significant subsidiaries;         •   plans to raise new funds or restructure debt;         •   projections of future profitability and the timing and amount of cash flows from operating activities;         •   the funding needs of regulated subsidiaries;         •   AIG’s ability to comply with debt covenants;         •   plans to reduce expenditures;         •   the effects of ratings agency actions on collateral requirements and other contractual conditions; and         •   the future regulatory, business, credit, and competitive environments in which AIG operates around the world.      125    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       These factors, individually and collectively, will have a significant effect on AIG’s ability to generate sufficient cash to repay indebtedness as it becomes due and profitably operate its businesses as it executes its restructuring initiatives.              •   Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses (General Insurance):                •   Loss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years.         •   Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2008 for the year-end 2008 loss reserve analysis. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years.         •   Loss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount.         •   Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses: the expected recoveries from reinsurers on losses that have not yet been reported and/or settled.       For discussion of sensitivity analysis on the reserve for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, see Results of Operations — Segment Results — General Insurance Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense.              •   Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):                •   Interest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products.         •   Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form, risk classification and distribution channel.       Periodically, the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) established for Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies are tested to ensure that, including consideration of future expected premium payments, they are adequate to provide for future policyholder benefit obligations. The assumptions used to perform the tests are current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, morbidity, terminations, company maintenance expenses and invested asset returns. For long duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. For business in-force outside of North America, 52 percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at March 31, 2009 resulted from traditional business where the lock-in principle applies. In most foreign locations, various guarantees are embedded in policies in force that may remain applicable for many decades into the future.     As experience changes over time, the best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes. Because of the long-term nature of many of AIG’s liabilities subject to the lock-in principle, small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy.              •   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):                •   Recoverability: based on current and future expected profitability, which is affected by interest rates, foreign exchange rates, mortality/morbidity experience, expenses, investment returns and policy persistency.                •   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General Insurance):                •   Recoverability: based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.                •   Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):                •   Estimated gross profits: to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (investment-oriented products), which affect the carrying value of DAC, unearned revenue liability, SIAs and associated      126    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                amortization patterns. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality and other expenses.                •   Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses (Financial Services):                •   Historical defaults and delinquency experience: utilizing factors, such as delinquency ratio, allowance ratio, charge-off ratio and charge-off coverage.         •   Portfolio characteristics: portfolio composition and consideration of the recent changes to underwriting criteria and portfolio seasoning.         •   External factors: consideration of current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.         •   Migration analysis: empirical technique measuring historical movement of similar finance receivables through various levels of repayment, delinquency, and loss categories to existing finance receivable pools.                •   Flight Equipment Recoverability (Financial Services):                •   Expected undiscounted future net cash flows: based upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and estimated terminal values of each aircraft based on expectations of market participants.                •   Other-Than-Temporary Impairments:       AIG evaluates its available for sale, equity method and cost method investments for impairment such that a security is considered a candidate for other-than-temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:              •   Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine consecutive months or longer);         •   The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or         •   AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.       The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. The above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline, such as that experienced in current credit markets, in which AIG could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary (severity losses). For further discussion, see Investments — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.     At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses. When AIG does not intend to hold or lacks the ability to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis, AIG records the unrealized loss in income. If a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to changes in circumstances, the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer existed.     In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for fixed maturity securities, which is not credit or foreign exchange related, AIG generally accretes into income the discount or amortizes the reduced premium resulting from the reduction in cost basis over the remaining life of the security. In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments,” (FSP FAS 115-2) and FSP FAS 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have    127    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,” (FSP FAS 157-4). See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on these FSPs.              •   Goodwill Impairment       Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. AIG performed goodwill impairment tests at March 31, 2009.     The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level or, when all reporting units that comprise an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, impairment is tested at the operating segment level.     Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG’s reporting units or operating segments and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit’s peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. As part of the impairment test, management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of AIG’s reporting units with AIG’s fully diluted common stock market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values.     If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in income to the extent of the excess.     Management observed a narrowing of the fair values over the carrying values of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services—Japan and Other and the Life Insurance & Retirement Services—Asia reporting units during the first quarter of 2009. AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.              •   Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets:       At March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, AIG recorded a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $14.3 billion and $11 billion, respectively. FAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” permits this asset to be recorded if the asset meets a more likely than not standard (i.e., more than 50 percent likely) that the asset will be realized. Realization of AIG’s net deferred tax asset depends on AIG’s ability to consummate the proposed AIA and ALICO debt for equity exchanges with the FRBNY and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred. Estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or its results of operations. Because the realization of the deferred tax asset relies on the completion of the proposed transactions and a projection of future taxable income, AIG views this as a critical accounting estimate.     AIG is relying upon producing taxable operating profits from the businesses to be retained, principally Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance. AIG has evaluated its forecasts of future operating income and determined that there will be sufficient operating income, inclusive of gains on the divestiture of businesses to realize the recorded net deferred tax asset.     When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at March 31, 2009, AIG considered all available evidence, including (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed through April 30, 2009 and additional actions expected to be completed during the    128    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     remainder of 2009, (iii) the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (iv) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving greater weight to discrete sources and to earlier future years in the forecast period, and (v) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate taxable amounts.     In assessing future GAAP taxable income, AIG considered its strong earnings history exclusive of the recent losses on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and from the securities lending program. AIG also considered the completed transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury, including (i) reduction of the interest rate payable on outstanding borrowing and undrawn amounts under the FRBNY Facility; (ii) the transfer of RMBS related to AIG’s U.S. securities lending program to ML II; (iii) the termination of substantially all multi-sector credit default swap transactions and sale of underlying CDO securities to ML III; (iv) the issuance of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for the AIG Series D Preferred Stock; and (v) the issuance of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock and the establishment of the Department of the Treasury Commitment.     In addition, AIG also considered the proposed transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury announced by AIG and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on March 2, 2009 which have not yet been consummated, including the AIA and ALICO debt for equity exchanges.     AIG’s profitability in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic conditions, catastrophes and other events around the world and, currently, AIG-specific events. Further, the results of operations in the first quarter of 2009 may not be indicative of the results expected for the full year because certain transactions proposed to be entered into with the Department of the Treasury and the FRBNY are not expected to be in place. However, AIG believes its forecasts are achievable.     There are many important factors that could significantly affect the attainment of AIG’s forecasted results. For a discussion of some of these factors, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.              •   U.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries:       Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes incurred on potential dispositions, as well as AIG’s reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.              •   Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview     AIG measures at fair value on a recurring basis financial instruments in its trading and available for sale securities portfolios, certain mortgage and other loans receivable, certain spot commodities, derivative assets and liabilities, securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), securities lending invested collateral, non-marketable equity investments included in other invested assets, certain policyholder contract deposits, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors, certain long-term debt, and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing, able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date.     The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other-than-active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. An other-than-active market is one in which there are few transactions, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued. Pricing observability is affected by a number    129    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions.     AIG management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. With respect to securities, AIG employs independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments. When AIG’s valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models.     Valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, currency rates, and other market-observable information, as applicable. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.     AIG employs specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of AIG’s financial assets and financial liabilities. AIG’s processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate, consistently applied, and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. AIG assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques. In addition, AIG may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from AIG’s valuation service providers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. AIG also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.     The fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination was as follows:                                          Fair        Percent         At March 31, 2009      Value       of Total           (In billions)            Fair value based on external sources(a)      $   379         94   %      Fair value based on internal sources        25         6                            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)      $   404         100   %                                       (a)    Includes $33.9 billion whose primary source is broker quotes.      (b)    Includes available for sale, trading and securities lending invested collateral securities.      See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG’s accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of the following financial assets and financial liabilities:              •   Fixed maturity securities;         •   Equity securities traded in active markets — trading and available for sale;         •   Non-traded equity investments — other invested assets;         •   Private limited partnership and hedge fund investments — other invested assets;      130    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   Separate account assets;         •   Freestanding derivatives;         •   Embedded policy derivatives;         •   AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio; and         •   Policyholder contract deposits.       Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     Under FAS 157, assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about fair value measurements.     At March 31, 2009, AIG classified $36.6 billion and $21.6 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.5 percent and 2.8 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, AIG classified $42.1 billion and $21.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.9 percent and 2.6 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.     In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.     Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     AIG values its assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3.     Private equity and real estate fund investments: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price, i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset. Subsequently, they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. AIG considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement.     Corporate bonds and private placement debt: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued using market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads), comparisons to benchmark derivative indices or movements in underlying credit spreads. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name credit default swap spreads and estimated recovery rates.     Certain RMBS and CMBS: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles, remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations, discounted cash flow techniques, and/or for RMBS option adjusted spread analyses.    131    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Certain Asset-Backed Securities — non-mortgage: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued based on external price/spread data. When position-specific external price data are not observable, the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities.     CDOs: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued based on external price/spread data from independent third parties, dealer quotations, matrix pricing, the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model or a combination thereof.     Interests in ML II and ML III: At their inception, AIG’s Maiden Lane Interests were valued at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. Subsequently, Maiden Lane Interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the Maiden Lane Interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool. The implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with AIG’s interests in the capital structure of the respective entities. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.     The fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in ML II and ML III will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of ML II and ML III. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.     See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests.     Increases in the discount rate or decreases in estimated future cash flows used in the valuation would decrease AIG’s estimate of the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests as shown in the table below.

In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.     The net notional amount, fair value of derivative liability and unrealized market valuation loss of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class were as follows:                                                                                                                  Unrealized Market                                    Valuation (Gain)                        Fair Value of        Loss Three Months            Net Notional Amount       Derivative Liability at       Ended March 31           March 31,        December 31,        March 31,        December 31,                        2009(a)       2008(a)       2009(b)       2008(b)       2009(c)       2008(c)           (In millions)            Regulatory Capital:                                                       Corporate loans      $   99,381       $   125,628       $   —       $   —       $   —       $   —        Prime residential mortgages        90,165         107,246         —         —         —         —        132    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                                                                                                                  Unrealized Market                                    Valuation (Gain)                        Fair Value of        Loss Three Months            Net Notional Amount       Derivative Liability at        Ended March 31           March 31,        December 31,        March 31,        December 31,                        2009(a)       2008(a)       2009(b)       2008(b)       2009(c)       2008(c)           (In millions)            Other(d)        3,008         1,575         393         379         14         —                                                            Total        192,554         234,449         393         379         14         —                                                            Arbitrage:                                                       Multi-sector CDOs(e)(f)        11,984         12,556         6,715         5,906         809         8,037        Corporate debt/CLOs(g)        49,601         50,495         2,196         2,554         (358   )       896                                                            Total        61,585         63,051         8,911         8,460         451         8,933                                                            Mezzanine tranches(h)        4,217         4,701         182         195         (13   )       174                                                            Total      $   258,356       $   302,201       $   9,486       $   9,034       $   452       $   9,107                                                                         (a)    Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

Through April 30, 2009, AIGFP has also received formal termination notices with respect to an additional $16.6 billion in net notional amount with effective termination dates in 2009. AIG expects that the counterparties in the remaining regulatory capital CDS transactions will terminate within the next 12 months the vast majority of transactions with AIGFP during the transition period of the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties.     During the first quarter of 2009, AIGFP reclassified one regulatory capital CDS transaction from Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans to Regulatory Capital — Other given the higher likelihood that it will not be terminated when the regulatory capital benefit expires for the counterparty. AIG does not believe that at this time the CDS provides significant risk transfer benefit to the counterparty; however, AIGFP will continue to monitor this transaction closely.     During April 2009, AIGFP effected the early termination of a CDS transaction written on a European RMBS security that was reported as part of Regulatory Capital — Other at March 31, 2009 at a level approximating its fair value at that time. Given its unique structure and concentrated exposure to high loan-to-value Spanish residential mortgages, this transaction had exposed AIGFP to a relatively higher level of liquidity and credit risk than any other regulatory capital CDS exposure, and AIG felt it prudent to terminate the transaction to avoid further deterioration.     In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 other than for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief.     AIG will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace. Given the significant deterioration in the credit markets and the risk that AIGFP’s expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize, there can be no assurance that AIG will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and, given its size, recognition   134    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     of even a small percentage decline in the fair value of this portfolio could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period or to AIG’s consolidated financial condition.

The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIG with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Further, in many cases of corporate loan transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of obligors are not disclosed. In addition, many of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets.     For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIG generally receives quarterly updates from the trustee for each such referenced pool detailing with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding, defaults, delinquencies, recoveries and realized losses. AIG also generally receives updated stratification tables for each pool incorporating remaining term, geography, property use and (for some pools) interest rates for the underlying residential mortgages. For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIG generally receives quarterly updates from the trustee for each such referenced pool detailing with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool the principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries and losses.     AIG also generally receives updated stratification tables for each pool incorporating remaining term, geography and the counterparty’s initial assessment of credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for many of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIG receives a notice detailing the identity and notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event. Where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies’ releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available.     Generally, the foregoing data with respect to each regulatory capital CDS transaction is received by AIG within a few weeks following the quarterly roll date of each deal. AIG analyzes all relevant data with respect to the underlying pools of assets required to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. While this data cannot be aggregated in a comparable way because of the limitations on and the nature of the data, it provides sufficient basis to evaluate the risks and determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.     Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and the expectation that counterparties will terminate these transactions prior to their maturity; AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief.    136    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents AIGFP’s regulatory capital — corporate loans portfolio by geographic location:                                                                                                                        Realized                                                Losses                              Net                    through        Weighted Average              At March 31, 2009      Notional        %        Current Average        March 31,        Maturity (Years)       Number of         Exposure Portfolio      Amount       of Total       Subordination(a)       2009(b)       To First Call       To Maturity       Transactions           (In billions)                                                Primarily Single Country Germany      $   7.10         7.10   %       17.30   %       0.10   %       3.50         9.90         3        Netherlands        3.30         3.30         21.10         —         1.00         44.70         1        Portugal        2.60         2.70         16.00         0.20         0.30         10.50         1        Australia        1.80         1.80         9.00         —         0.50         2.00         1        Finland        0.40         0.40         37.10         —         2.80         5.80         1                                                                    Subtotal Single Country      $   15.20         15.30   %       17.70   %               2.00         16.70         7                                                                    Regional                                                               Asia        2.10         2.10         16.10         —         0.80         3.00         1        Europe        60.20         60.60         19.20         —         0.50         5.60         11        North America        21.90         22.00         16.40         —         0.70         2.00         5                                                                    Subtotal Regional        84.20         84.70         18.40                 0.50         4.60         17                                                                    Total      $   99.40         100.00   %       18.30   %               0.80         6.30         24                                                                                 (a)    Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

In certain cases, simultaneously with the exercise of the 2a-7 Puts by AIGFP’s counterparties, AIGFP accessed financing arrangements previously entered into with such counterparties, pursuant to which the counterparties remained the legal owners of the underlying CDO securities. However, these securities were reported as part of AIGFP’s investment portfolio as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Most of these underlying CDO securities were later acquired by ML III from AIGFP’s counterparties. In a separate case, AIGFP extinguished its obligations with respect to one CDS by purchasing the protected CDO security.      (b)    The CDS in respect of the ML III transaction were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 based on the fair value of the underlying multi-sector CDOs at October 31, 2008, as mutually agreed between the FRBNY and AIG. AIGFP recognized the change in fair value of the CDS through that date.      The unrealized market valuation loss of the AIGFP super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swaps were as follows:                                                                  Three Months Ended March 31,       Year Ended December 31,             2009       2008       2008       2007           (In millions)            CDS — terminated in connection with ML III      $   —       $   6,754       $   20,365       $   9,680        CDS — underlying CDO purchased by AIGFP        —         311         854         141        CDS — all other        809         972         4,481         1,425                                            Total      $   809       $   8,037       $   25,700       $   11,246                                              139    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents, for each multi-sector CDO that is a reference obligation in a CDS written by AIGFP, the gross and net notional amounts at March 31, 2009, attachment points at inception and at March 31, 2009 and percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B-3 at March 31, 2009:                                                                                                      Percentage of Gross            Gross Notional        Net Notional                    Notional Amount Rated            Amount at        Amount at              Attachment Point        Less than B-/B-3 at            March 31,        March 31,        Attachment Point        at March 31,        March 31,         CDO      2009       2009       at Inception*       2009*       2009            1      $   1,646       $   1,406         12.00   %       14.58   %       18.59   %      2        630         364         27.00   %       42.25   %       25.60   %      3        1,046         798         20.00   %       23.68   %       17.75   %      4        1,256         475         40.00   %       62.18   %       43.31   %      5        431         224         36.00   %       48.01   %       31.58   %      6        697         326         53.00   %       53.20   %       14.20   %      7        1,000         470         53.00   %       53.00   %       50.13   %      8        1,402         355         76.00   %       74.66   %       61.94   %      9        1,109         4         10.83   %       11.28   %       17.46   %      10        352         200         39.33   %       43.33   %       75.51   %      11        1,161         1,049         12.27   %       9.60   %       7.61   %      12        1,219         853         25.24   %       24.96   %       10.73   %      13        1,477         1,350         10.00   %       8.64   %       20.38   %      14        546         328         33.00   %       39.97   %       65.71   %      15        559         257         33.25   %       31.75   %       68.03   %      16        2,410         1,664         16.50   %       17.84   %       0.00   %      17        457         240         32.00   %       47.40   %       41.35   %      18        660         501         24.49   %       24.08   %       66.21   %      19        721         438         32.90   %       39.31   %       73.24   %      20        360         209         34.51   %       41.83   %       77.45   %      21        4,869         473         9.72   %       10.53   %       35.03   %                                                  Total      $   24,008       $   11,984                                                                                         *    Expressed as a percentage of gross notional amount.      In a number of instances, the level of subordination with respect to individual CDOs has increased since inception relative to the overall size of the CDO. While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.     The gross transaction notional amount, percentage of the total CDO collateral pools, and ratings and vintage breakdown of collateral securities in the multi-sector CDOs, by asset-backed securities (ABS) category, were as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                          Gross                                                                                       At March 31, 2009      Transaction                                                                                      ABS      Notional        Percent        Ratings       Vintage        Category      Amount       of Total       AAA       AA       A       BBB       BB       <BB       NR       2009       2008       2007       2006       2005+P           (In millions)            RMBS PRIME      $   2,933         12.22   %       3.44   %       2.39   %       4.97   %       0.83   %       0.05   %       0.54   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.30   %       7.14   %       3.53   %       1.25   %                                                                                                                          RMBS ALT-A        3,453         14.38   %       1.31   %       0.19   %       0.21   %       1.48   %       0.55   %       10.64   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.65   %       3.79   %       5.14   %       4.80   %                                                                                                                          RMBS SUBPRIME        6,401         26.66   %       0.84   %       3.42   %       1.83   %       2.25   %       2.08   %       16.24   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       1.24   %       1.81   %       23.61   %                                                                                                                          CMBS        4,343         18.09   %       3.46   %       2.41   %       2.88   %       5.15   %       1.38   %       2.79   %       0.02   %       0.00   %       0.07   %       1.18   %       5.67   %       11.17   %                                                                                                                          CDO        3,058         12.74   %       0.97   %       1.28   %       1.31   %       1.64   %       0.59   %       6.90   %       0.05   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.61   %       1.72   %       10.41   %                                                                                                                          OTHER        3,820         15.91   %       4.21   %       3.88   %       5.00   %       2.22   %       0.23   %       0.37   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.39   %       0.69   %       3.77   %       11.06   %                                                                                                                          Total      $   24,008         100.00   %       14.23   %       13.57   %       16.20   %       13.57   %       4.88   %       37.48   %       0.07   %       0.00   %       1.41   %       14.65   %       21.64   %       62.30   %                                                                                                                            140    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Corporate Debt/CLOs     The corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of CDS written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the CDS.

These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.     Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions     As of March 31, 2009, 73.5 percent of AIGFP’s regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to a Credit Support Annex (CSA). In other transactions, which represent 1.0 percent of the total net notional amount of the outstanding regulatory capital relief transactions, AIGFP is obligated to put a CSA or alternative collateral arrangement in place if AIG’s ratings fall below certain levels (typically, A-/A3). At March 31, 2009, 25.5 percent of the regulatory capital relief portfolio is not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone Master Agreement or similar agreement, under which the aggregate Exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.     The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies from one counterparty to another, and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from varied negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.     Reference to Market Indices — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans, or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.     Market Value of Reference Obligation — Under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the difference between the net notional amount of a referenced RMBS security and the security’s market value.     Expected Loss Models — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.     Negotiated Amount — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.     The amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than AIGFP’s super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) were as follows (there were no collateral postings on this portfolio prior to March 31, 2008):                                                                                          March 31,        June 30,        September 30,        December 31,        March 31,        April 30,            2008       2008       2008       2008       2009       2009           (In millions)            Reference to market indices      $   212       $   177       $   157       $   667       $   598       $   372        Market value of referenced obligation        —         142         286         380         317         —        Expected loss models        —         —         —         5         24         24        Negotiated amount        —         —         —         235         225         223                                                            Total      $   212       $   319       $   443       $   1,287       $   1,164       $   619                                                               Collateral Calls     AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in    143    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.     The amount of collateral postings with respect to AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) were as follows:                                                                                          December 31,        March 31,        June 30,        September 30,        December 31,        March 31,            2007       2008       2008       2008       2008       2009           (In millions)            Regulatory capital      $   —       $   212       $   319       $   443       $   1,287       $   1,164        Arbitrage — multi-sector CDO        2,718         7,590         13,241         31,469         5,129         6,208        Arbitrage — corporate        161         368         259         902         2,349         1,995                                                            Total      $   2,879       $   8,170       $   13,819       $   32,814       $   8,765       $   9,367                                                               The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG’s credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the severe market disruption, lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it would be required to post in the future.     Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio     Multi-Sector CDOs     AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG’s calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average for any quarterly period during the past year, prices for CDOs declined between 6.14 percent and 11.93 percent of the notional amount outstanding. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current dislocated market conditions.     For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $12.0 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at March 31, 2009, a BET value is available for $8.4 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $3.6 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $8.4 billion.     As mentioned above, the most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities given their significantly depressed valuations. Given the current difficult market conditions, AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.    144    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at March 31, 2009 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                  Inputs Used at          Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability           March 31,          Entire        RMBS        RMBS        RMBS                              2009     Change     Portfolio       PRIME       ALT-A       Subprime       CMBS       CDOs       Other                   (Dollars in millions)            Bond prices      33 points     Increase of 5 points     $   (598   )     $   (19   )     $   (53   )     $   (258   )     $   (139   )     $   (97   )     $   (32   )             Decrease of 5 points       525         21         48         229         131         63         33                                                                                   Increase of 1 year       171         5         9         160         (11   )       5         3        Weighted average life      5.01 years     Decrease of 1 year       (382   )       (7   )       (8   )       (365   )       10         (4   )       (8   )                                                                          Recovery rates      21%     Increase of 10%       (69   )       (5   )       (6   )       (23   )       (27   )       (6   )       (2   )             Decrease of 10%       89         6         5         45         29         1         3                                                                            Diversity score(a)      16     Increase of 5       (6   )                                                             Decrease of 5       19                                                                                                                            Discount curve(b)      N/A     Increase of 100 bps       43                                                                                                                                         (a)    The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Investment Strategy     AIG’s investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Retirement Services and Asset Management’s Spread-Based Investment business. The primary objectives are liquidity, preservation of capital, growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products. Difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered AIG’s ability to achieve these objectives, and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future.     At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.     The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies, as well as in the GIC and MIP portfolios of the Asset Management segment, the fundamental investment strategy is to match, as nearly as is practicable, the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Commercial Insurance historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In light of AIG’s recent net operating losses, AIG changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax-exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries. Fixed maturity securities held by Foreign General Insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities.   147    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk, and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.     AIG records at fair value the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies pursuant to FAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and related accounting pronouncements. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on AIG’s balance sheet pursuant to SOP 03-01), AIG does not adjust the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG’s liabilities. Because AIG’s asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the fair value of its fixed maturity portfolio.     At March 31, 2009, approximately 54 percent of the fixed maturity securities were in domestic entities. Approximately 27 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately seven percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG’s investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspectives for consideration in the internal analysis.     A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody’s, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG’s Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2009, approximately 13 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG’s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated.

The decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of AIG’s management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the sale decision reflects management’s judgment that the risk-discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale.     AIG evaluates its investments for impairments in valuation as well as credit. The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments herein for further information.     After a security has been identified as other-than-temporarily impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that security’s contemporaneous fair value and recorded as a charge to earnings.    155    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       As a result of AIG’s periodic evaluation of its securities for other-than-temporary impairments in value, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $4.0 billion and $5.6 billion in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.     In light of the recent significant disruption in the U.S. residential mortgage and credit markets, AIG has recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge (severity loss) of $1.8 billion and $4.1 billion in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily related to mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateral securities, securities of financial institutions and other equity securities. Notwithstanding AIG’s intent and ability to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis, and despite structures that indicate that a substantial amount of the securities should continue to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.     Pricing of CMBS has been adversely affected by market perceptions that underlying mortgage defaults will increase. As a result, AIG recognized $55 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 on CMBS valued at a severe discount to cost, despite the absence of any meaningful deterioration in performance of the underlying credits, because AIG concluded that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment period was temporary. AIG recognized $97 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges due to issuer-specific credit events.     Certain high quality, highly rated securities in the CMBS portfolio experienced severe market price declines in late 2008 and to date in 2009. With respect to this portfolio, AIG has performed extensive internal fundamental credit risk analysis on a security-by-security basis, including consideration of credit enhancements and expected defaults on underlying collateral. In management’s view, this internal analysis, supplemented by relevant industry analyst reports and forecasts and other market available data, provides persuasive evidence sufficient to overcome the premise that such severe declines in fair value below amortized cost should be considered other than temporary. As a result, impairment charges were not taken on certain CMBS having fair values $1.9 billion below amortized cost in the first quarter of 2009.     In addition to the above severity losses, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 related to:              •   securities that AIG does not intend to hold until recovery;         •   declines due to foreign exchange rates;         •   issuer-specific credit events;         •   certain structured securities impaired under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,” and related interpretative guidance; and         •   other impairments, including equity securities and partnership investments.      156    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and

condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.06 percent of Total equity in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009.     In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for fixed maturity securities, that is not credit or foreign exchange related, AIG generally accretes into income the discount or amortizes the reduced premium resulting from the reduction in cost basis over the remaining life of the security. The amount of accretion recognized in earnings for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was $445 million.

(f)    Of this $12.4 billion, $4.2 billion relates to RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and ABS with unrealized losses greater than 25 percent; and $1.0 billion relates to RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and ABS with unrealized losses between 20 percent and 25 percent. The balance represents all other classes of fixed maturity securities.      (g)    Total bonds unrealized loss of $2.4 billion primarily represents corporate debt of financial institutions and CMBS not deemed other than temporarily impaired based on credit analysis.      Unrealized gains and losses     At March 31, 2009, the carrying value of AIG’s available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities aggregated $360.6 billion and the aggregate pre-tax unrealized gains for such securities were $13.8 billion ($9.0 billion after tax).     At March 31, 2009, the aggregate pre-tax gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were $25.8 billion ($16.8 billion after tax). Additional information about these securities is as follows:              •   These securities were valued, in the aggregate, at approximately 86 percent of their current amortized cost.         •   Approximately 25 percent of these securities had unrealized losses of less than or equal to 20 percent of their current cost, or amortized cost.      159    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   Approximately four percent of the fixed maturity securities had issuer credit ratings which were below investment grade.       AIG did not consider these securities in an unrealized loss position to be other-than-temporarily impaired at March 31, 2009 because management has the intent and ability to hold these investments until they recover their cost basis within a recovery period deemed to be temporary. In performing this evaluation, management considered the market recovery periods for securities in previous periods of broad market declines. In addition, for certain securities with more significant declines, management performed extended fundamental credit analysis on a security-by-security basis including consideration of credit enhancements, expected defaults on underlying collateral, review of relevant industry analyst reports and forecasts and other market available data. In management’s view this analysis provides persuasive evidence sufficient to conclude that such severe declines in fair value below amortized cost should not be considered other than temporary.     In the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, unrealized losses related to investment grade bonds increased $610 million ($397 million after tax), reflecting the widening of credit spreads, partially offset by the effects of a decline in risk-free interest rates.     The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position by contractual maturity were as follows:                                       At March 31, 2009      Amortized Cost       Fair Value           (In millions)            Due in one year or less      $   5,459       $   5,021        Due after one year through five years        37,624         33,593        Due after five years through ten years        47,535         41,369        Due after ten years        64,202         56,165        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized        31,170         24,680                            Total      $   185,990       $   160,828                               For the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, the pre-tax gross realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $434 million. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $4.8 billion, which was approximately 92 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately five months. See Risk Management — Credit Risk Management herein for an additional discussion of investment risks associated with AIG’s investment portfolio.     Risk Management     For a complete discussion of AIG’s risk management program, see Risk Management in the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Overview     The unprecedented market turmoil and the consequent unanticipated price declines and associated reduction of liquidity in 2008 exceeded the parameters historically used by AIG for purposes of its asset-liability and liquidity management processes. AIG has responded to these developments by enhancing its risk management processes and de-risking certain exposures, based upon enhanced scenario-related stress testing. De-risking plans have been implemented at both the business units and the corporate level in an effort to minimize the capital and liquidity needs of AIG’s local legal entities. However, the continuation of such market turmoil and associated price declines, limited liquidity in the markets and a decline in the number of counterparties willing to transact with AIG have severely constrained AIG’s ability to utilize techniques for mitigating its exposure to credit, market and liquidity risks.     AIG continues to reassess its risk management control environment and its enterprise risk management functions, both in its individual businesses as well as at the corporate level, in light of AIG’s current situation. AIG continues to invest in risk management systems and processes where those investments are consistent with AIG’s current liquidity, capital and disposition plans.    160    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Credit Risk Management     AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives, deposits and letters of credit (both in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.     The following table presents AIG’s largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity:                                        Credit Exposure        At March 31, 2009          as a Percentage of         Category      Risk Rating(a)     Total Equity            Investment Grade:                   10 largest combined      BBB+(b)       184.5   %(c)      Single largest non-sovereign (financial institution)      BBB−       17.2        Single largest corporate      AA       8.8        Single largest sovereign      AAA       34.9        Non-Investment Grade:                   Single largest sovereign      BB−       3.3        Single largest non-sovereign      BB       1.2                                     (a)    Reflects AIG’s internal risk ratings.      (b)    Four of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions, four are to investment-grade rated sovereigns and two are to government-sponsored entities. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB- or its equivalent.      (c)    Exposure to the ten largest combined as a percentage of Total equity was 150.7 percent at December 31, 2008.      AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG defines its cross-border exposure to include both cross-border credit exposures and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Nine countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 20 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2009. Based on AIG’s internal risk ratings, at that date, seven were rated AAA, one was rated AA and one was rated A.     In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG’s single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, comprised of banks, securities firms, life and non-life insurance companies, reinsurance companies, finance companies and government-sponsored entities.     The following table presents AIG’s largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity:                              Credit Exposure            as a Percentage of         At March 31, 2009      Total Equity            Industry Category:               Money Center / Global Bank Groups        158.4   %*      Government-Sponsored Entities        37.8        European Regional Financial Institutions        30.6        Global Life Insurance Companies        28.9        Global Reinsurance Companies        19.1        North American Based Regional Financial Institutions        15.0        Asian Regional Financial Institutions        14.6        Global Securities Companies        12.8        Non-Life Insurance Companies        10.1                                 *    Exposure to Money Center/Global Bank Groups as a percentage of Total equity was 138.7 percent at December 31, 2008.     161    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIG’s exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 64.6 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2009.     AIG’s exposure to global financial institutions includes $6.0 billion of preferred stock and Tier 1 securities, $1.1 billion of upper Tier 2 securities and $10.1 billion of lower Tier 2 securities. These securities can be subject to a higher risk of dividend or interest deferral and principal non-payment or non-redemption because they provide various levels of capital support to these institutions, and may be subject to regulatory and contractual restrictions. These securities are held by various AIG subsidiaries and are diversified by obligor and country. In addition, AIG’s financial institution exposures include other subordinated securities totaling $16.6 billion.     Market Risk Management     AIG’s market exposures can be categorized as follows:              •   Benchmark interest rates. Benchmark interest rates are also known as risk-free interest rates and are associated with either the government / treasury yield curve or the swap curve. The fair value of AIG’s significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change.         •   Credit spread or risk premium. Credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable-duration, default-free instrument.         •   Equity and alternative investment prices. AIG’s exposure to equity and alternative investment prices arises from direct investments in common stocks and mutual funds, from minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and from other equity-like investments, such as partnerships comprised of hedge funds and private equity funds, private equity investments, commercial real estate and real estate funds.         •   Foreign currency exchange rates. AIG is a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets, liabilities and capital denominated in a variety of currencies.       AIG uses a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify its market risk exposure, including:              •   Duration/key rate duration. Duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed-income instrument to the parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve.         •   Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macro-economic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets.         •   Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time with a specified level of statistical confidence. VaR measures not only the size of individual exposures but also the interaction between different market exposures, thereby providing a portfolio approach to measuring market risk. A key shortcoming of the VaR approach is its reliance on historical data, making VaR calculations essentially “backward looking.” This shortcoming was most evident during the current credit crisis.         •   Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis whereby the scenarios used are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome (for example, the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of RMBS or CMBS during 2008). Stress testing is often used to address VaR shortcomings and complement VaR calculations. Particularly in times of significant volatility in financial markets, using stress scenarios provides more pertinent and forward-looking information on market risk exposure than VaR results based upon historical data alone.       The magnitudes of volatilities of financial markets and degree of correlation among different markets, risks and asset classes in 2008 were unprecedented and rendered the VaR measure that is based on historical data analysis a much less reliable and indicative risk measure. As a result, AIG now uses sensitivities under specific scenarios to convey the magnitude of its exposures to various key market risk factors, such as yield curve, equity markets and alternative assets, and foreign currency exchange rates.    162    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Insurance Risk Management     Catastrophe Exposures     The nature of AIG’s business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year. In order to control this exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting aggregate limits in key business units, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections.     Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIG’s operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, like the Swine Flu Influenza A Virus (H1N1), could adversely affect AIG’s business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs.     Pandemic Influenza     On April 25, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that new lab studies confirm that the latest outbreak of Swine Flu is a new strain of a humanly transmissible influenza virus that has the potential to trigger an influenza pandemic. On April 29, 2009, the WHO raised its flu alert level to 5, the second highest level, which indicates a pandemic is imminent.     The swine flu virus has the potential to spread rapidly and has already spread from North America to Australia and Asia. If such a pandemic were to take place, early quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment. Although AIG continues to monitor the developing facts, current evidence suggests that a resulting pandemic would be of moderate severity with some chance that it could be severe. A significant global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates.     Utilizing a scenario-based approach and an industry standard model, AIG has analyzed its insurance risk associated with pandemic influenza. As previously reported, for a severe event, considered to be a recurrence of the 1918 Flu Epidemic, the analysis indicates AIG could incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $6.2 billion if this event were to recur. For a mild event, considered to be a recurrence of the influenza epidemic of 1968, the analysis indicates AIG could incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $0.6 billion if such an event were to recur. These analyses were based on 2007 policy data representing approximately 95 percent of AIG’s individual life, group life and credit life books of business, net of reinsurance at that point in time. These estimates do not include claims that could be made under other policies, such as business interruption or general liability policies, and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of AIG’s own business operations or asset valuation losses that may arise consequent to such a pandemic. These related losses may be significant and in some scenarios exceed the losses incurred from AIG’s life insurance coverages.     Although it is too early to be definitive about the likely dimensions of the aggregate life insurance loss, if there is a swift and effective response for its containment, some key features of the swine flu virus that place its likely impact toward the lower end of the range provided above are as follows:              •   Virulence: The mortality level of those infected is estimated to be significantly lower than that of the 2006-2007 “avian flu” (H5N1) virus but higher than that of a seasonal flu outbreak;         •   Infectiousness: The level of infectiousness, measured by the virus’s initial reproductive number is currently estimated to be below that of each of the last three pandemics;         •   Human Immunity: The swine flu is a strain of the H1N1 influenza virus and hence some of the population may have built up immunity to the virus;         •   Age profile of deaths to date: Although currently affecting a similar age profile to that of the 1918 pandemic flu, initial clinical reports are predominantly recording “severe pneumonia” symptoms, meaning that it may not be triggering the worst case scenario of a severe immune system reaction in the affected population like that in the 1918 Flu Epidemic.      163    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Recent Accounting Standards     Accounting Changes     In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations.”     In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.”     In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.”     In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-3, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase Financing Transactions.”     In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock.”     Future Application of Accounting Standards     In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employer’s Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.”     In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.”     In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than Temporary Impairments.”     In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly.”     For further discussion of these recent accounting standards and their application to AIG, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures       In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2009, AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.    164    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Part II — OTHER INFORMATION            ITEM 1.    Legal Proceedings       Included in Note 9(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.           ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors       The following supplements the important factors that may affect AIG’s business and operations described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part I of AIG’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Employees     A loss of key AIGFP employees could prevent an orderly wind-down of AIGFP’s businesses and portfolios, lead to potentially significant losses and could adversely affect AIG’s internal controls over financial reporting. In light of, among other things, the negative publicity surrounding the retention payments to AIGFP employees, a number of key employees have left AIGFP. While AIGFP continues to wind down its business in an orderly manner, the loss of additional key employees could adversely affect AIG’s ability to effectively wind down AIGFP and could adversely affect AIG’s internal controls over financial reporting. Although AIG views the large-market risk books at AIGFP as generally well hedged, with the exception of credit risk, maintaining the hedges requires continuous monitoring and adjustment. If AIGFP loses the key employees who are familiar with and know how to hedge these positions, gaps in hedging could result in significant losses to AIGFP. AIG relies upon the knowledge and experience of the AIGFP employees involved in the financial reporting process for the effective and timely preparation of required filings and financial statements and operation of internal controls. In addition, AIGFP’s portfolios contain a significant number of complex transactions that are difficult to understand and manage. It would not be practical to replace all the key AIGFP traders and risk managers who oversee these complex transactions if these employees were to leave AIGFP. Personal knowledge of these trades and the unique systems at AIGFP is critical to an effective wind-down of AIGFP’s businesses and portfolios. Furthermore, in the current economic environment, any perceived disruption in AIGFP’s ability to conduct business, such as one that would result from the departure of these key employees, could cause parties to limit or cease trading with AIGFP, which would further adversely affect AIGFP’s ability to cost-effectively hedge its positions and its effort to wind down its businesses and portfolios.     Employee departures may also have regulatory ramifications for AIGFP. As an example, the recent resignations (one of which was rescinded) of two senior managers of AIGFP’s Banque AIG S.A. (Banque AIG) subsidiary would have permitted the Commission Bancaire, the French banking regulator, to appoint its own designee to step in and manage Banque AIG if AIG had been unable to retain or replace these key employees to the satisfaction of the Commission Bancaire. Such an appointment by the Commission Bancaire would constitute an event of default under Banque AIG’s derivative and structured transactions, including the regulatory capital CDS portfolio, and potentially entail very substantial unwind costs, the amount of which is difficult to estimate.     Separation and Restructuring Plan     The complexity of executing AIG’s disposition plan, combined with the challenges of operating AIG’s business in the current environment, could place further stress on AIG’s internal controls, increase AIG’s costs and divert the attention of AIG management and employees from their normal duties. The execution of AIG’s restructuring plan is introducing a large number of complex and non-standard transactions which are placing a strain on existing resources, systems and communication channels. Furthermore, AIG’s employees are operating in an environment where the frequency and uncertainty of developments could decrease the attention devoted to transactions and critical management review controls. Although AIG is taking steps to mitigate these risks, including through the use of third party consultants and advance planning, it is possible that these risks could prevent AIG from making required filings, preparing financial statements and otherwise adversely affect AIG’s internal controls.     Also, increased costs will result from the creation and maintenance of this new operating infrastructure.    165    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Reputational Harm     Adverse publicity and public reaction to events concerning AIG has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on AIG. Since September 2008, AIG has been the subject of intense scrutiny and extensive comment by global news media, officials of governments and regulatory authorities around the world and segments of the public at large in the communities that AIG serves. At times, there has been strong criticism of actions taken by AIG, its management and its employees and of transactions in which AIG has engaged. In a few instances, such as the public reaction in March 2009 over the payment of retention awards to AIGFP employees, this criticism has included harassment of individual AIG employees or public protest affecting AIG facilities.     To date, this scrutiny and extensive commentary has adversely affected AIG by damaging AIG’s business, reputation and brand among current and potential customers, agents and other distributors of AIG products and services, thereby reducing sales of AIG products and services, and resulting in an increase in AIG policyholder surrenders and non-renewals of AIG policies. This scrutiny and commentary has also undermined employee morale and AIG’s ability to motivate and retain its employees. If this level of scrutiny and criticism continues or increases, AIG’s business may be further adversely affected and its ability to retain and motivate employees further harmed.     Deferred Tax Asset     The recoverability of AIG’s deferred tax asset is based on a number of significant assumptions which may not occur. The recoverability of this asset depends on AIG attaining its operating income projections and the completion of the proposed debt for equity swap transactions with the FRBNY. A failure of AIG to generate future profits or the inability of AIG to complete the proposed debt for equity swap transactions with the FRBNY could result in AIG recording a charge resulting in a reduction, possibly material, of the deferred tax asset.           ITEM 5.    Other Information       On May 6, 2009, AIG received letters of resignation as Directors from Ms. Virginia M. Rometty and Mr. Michael H. Sutton effective May 7, 2009.           ITEM 6.
