Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. MD&A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 (2013 Annual Report).      AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     77     TABLE OF CONTENTS       The MD&A is organized as follows:    INDEX TO ITEM 2         Page     USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES   79     EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW   81     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   93      Segment Results   95      AIG Property Casualty Operations   100      Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense   117      AIG Life and Retirement Operations   125       Other Operations   141     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   149      Overview   149      Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash   151      Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries   153      Credit Facilities   157      Contingent Liquidity Facilities   158      Contractual Obligations   158      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   159      Debt   161      Credit Ratings   163      Regulation and Supervision   164      Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock   164      Dividend Restrictions   165     INVESTMENTS   165      Overview   165      Investment Highlights   165      Investment Strategies   166      Credit Ratings   166      Investments by Segment   168      Available-for-Sale Investments   170      Impairments   178     ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT   183      Overview   183      Credit Risk Management   183      Market Risk Management   184      Liquidity Risk Management   187     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   188     REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT   188     Glossary   190     Acronyms   194           78       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES Throughout this MD&A, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, representative and transparent. Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.” The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (AOCI) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per‑share basis. We believe Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non‑cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG and our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A. AIG — After‑tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG:    · income (loss) from discontinued operations; · income (loss) from divested businesses, including:  · gain on the sale of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC); and · certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and related tax effects; · legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments; · legal reserves (settlements) related to “legacy crisis matters,” which include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters; · deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges;   · changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense); · changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains (losses); · AIG Property Casualty other (income) expense — net; · (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; · net realized capital (gains) losses; and · non‑qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses.          79       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      · AIG Property Casualty · Pre‑tax operating income (loss): includes both underwriting income (loss) and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital (gains) losses, other (income) expense — net, and legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above. Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses. · Ratios: AIG Property Casualty, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. · Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $10 million each. · AIG Life and Retirement · Pre‑tax operating income (loss) is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income (loss):     · legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above;   · net realized capital (gains) losses; and     · changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense);   · changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses).      · Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts and mutual funds. · Other Operations — Pre‑tax operating income (loss) is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income (loss):    · certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters described above; · (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; · net realized capital (gains) losses; · changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses); · income (loss) from divested businesses, including Aircraft Leasing; and   · net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses, including: · gain on the sale of ILFC; and  · certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and our share of AerCap’s income taxes.      Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.      80       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW          EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG’s securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, together with the 2013 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  We report our results of operations as follows: · AIG Property Casualty – AIG Property Casualty offers property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. Commercial insurance products for large and small businesses are primarily distributed through insurance brokers. Major lines of business include casualty, property, financial and specialty (including aerospace, environmental, surety, marine, trade credit and political risk insurance). Consumer insurance products are distributed to individual consumers or groups of consumers through insurance brokers, agents, and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Consumer insurance products include accident & health (A&H) and personal insurance. In addition, Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) in Japan offers life insurance products through Fuji Life Insurance Company (Fuji Life), which are included in A&H. · AIG Life and Retirement – AIG Life and Retirement offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, A&H, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, stable value wrap products, mutual funds and financial planning. AIG Life and Retirement offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms.  · Other Operations – AIG's Other Operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets (GCM) operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), the Direct Investment book (DIB), including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP, Corporate & Other operations (after certain allocations to AIG's business segments), Aircraft Leasing through May 14, 2014 and, subsequent to May 14, 2014, AIG’s share of AerCap earnings based on its 46 percent ownership interest. On September 1, 2014, in accordance with AIG’s previously disclosed succession plan, Peter D. Hancock assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of AIG and joined AIG’s Board of Directors. He succeeded Robert H. Benmosche, who retired and currently serves as an advisor to AIG. Mr. Hancock has announced his intention to continue the previously announced reorganization of our commercial and consumer insurance businesses, and we continue to finalize elements of the new organization and operating structure. When the new structure is finalized, the presentation of AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement results may be modified and prior periods’ presentation may be revised to conform to the new structure.     81       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Executive Summary Financial Performance         AIG Property Casualty pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher net investment income, improved loss experience in Consumer Insurance, a lower Commercial Insurance current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and reduced severe losses were partially offset by higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. Pre-tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the frequency of severe losses, higher adverse prior year loss reserve development, higher catastrophe losses and a decrease in net investment income, which were partially offset by improved accident year claim experience in Consumer Insurance.  AIG Life and Retirement pre-tax operating income improved for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting higher fee income from strong growth in assets under management and higher alternative investment income. The three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 each included a net positive adjustment related to the update of actuarial assumptions. The adjustment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included a higher positive adjustment for the update of assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for the interest-sensitive product lines compared to the same periods in the prior year, which was offset by a reduction in pre-tax operating income in the 2014 periods to record loss recognition expense for certain discontinued long-term care business. Premiums and deposits increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting strong sales of variable and index annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line and a deposit for a stable value wrap funding agreement, partially offset by lower sales of Retail Mutual Funds and, in the three-month period, lower sales of Fixed Annuities. Mortgage Guaranty pre‑tax operating income improved in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to an increase in net premiums earned and an increase in favorable prior year loss reserve development. New insurance written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to declining levels of mortgage refinancing activity. Income on our investment portfolio performance improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option, driven by movements on interest rates and spreads since December 31, 2013, and higher income on alternative investments which continued to benefit from strong equity market performance. Net realized capital gains increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to gains on foreign currency-denominated debt as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies. Net realized capital gains declined in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower capital gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization and higher fair value losses on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges.      82       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Our Performance – Selected Indicators                  Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended          September 30,       September 30,     (in millions, except per share data and ratios)       2014       2013           2014       2013     Results of operations data:                                         Total revenues   $    16,654    $    15,944        $    48,871    $    51,332      Income from continuing operations        2,199         2,148             6,864         7,046      Net income attributable to AIG        2,192         2,170             6,874         7,107      Net income per common share attributable to AIG (diluted)        1.52         1.46             4.71         4.80      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG        1,745         1,421             5,359         5,058      After-tax operating income per common share attributable                                         to AIG (diluted)        1.21         0.96             3.67         3.41      Key metrics:                                         AIG Property Casualty combined ratio        102.0         101.6             100.6         100.5      AIG Property Casualty accident year combined ratio, as adjusted        95.6         98.0             96.6         97.2      AIG Life and Retirement premiums and deposits   $    9,662    $    8,422        $    24,151    $    20,767      AIG Life and Retirement assets under management        333,978         304,399             333,978         304,399      Mortgage Guaranty domestic first-lien new insurance written        12,643         14,230             31,305         38,603                                                                        September 30,       December 31,     (in millions, except per share data)                           2014       2013     Balance sheet data:                                         Total assets                       $    527,190    $    541,329      Long-term debt                            36,223         41,693      Total AIG shareholders’ equity                            108,581         100,470      Book value per common share                            77.35         68.62      Book value per common share, excluding AOCI                            69.28         64.28     The following table presents a reconciliation of Book value per common share to Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a non-GAAP measure.

For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. (b) Includes operating borrowings of other subsidiaries and consolidated investments and hybrid debt securities. Liquidity and Capital Resources 2014 Highlights         We reduced our debt in the first nine months of 2014 as a result of maturities, repayments and repurchases of $10.4 billion, of which $5.0 billion is related to DIB redemptions and repurchases.  We maintained financial flexibility in the first nine months of 2014 through $1.5 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from AIG Property Casualty and $4.3 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement, which included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds. Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), by an additional $1.5 billion on October 31, 2014, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization at such time of approximately $1.5 billion of AIG Common Stock.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased approximately 60 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.4 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of these shares, reflect our payment of $1.7 billion in the aggregate under three accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreements and our receipt of approximately 27 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 8.8 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR Agreement executed in September 2014.      85       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      We paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share on each of March 25, 2014, June 24, 2014 and September 25, 2014. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on November 3, 2014 of $0.125 per share, payable on December 18, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2014. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion from the sale of ILFC after taking into account the settlement of intercompany loans. This cash amount is in addition to the 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares we received as consideration from the sale. Investment Highlights         Net investment income increased to $4.0 billion and $12.1 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Net investment income for our insurance operations increased by approximately $202 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher income on alternative investments, which continued to benefit from strong equity market performance. Net investment income for our insurance operations decreased by approximately $57 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on assets for which we elected the fair value option, partially offset by higher income on alternative investments. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.  Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $18.1 billion as of September 30, 2014 from approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 due to a decline in interest rates over the period and the narrowing of investment grade credit spreads, partially offset by the widening of high yield spreads. The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio remains largely unchanged from December 31, 2013. Strategic Outlook Industry Trends         Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2014, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global markets and slowing growth in emerging markets, China and Euro-Zone economies.  Interest rates remain low relative to historical levels, which have affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines.     86       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW         AIG Priorities for 2014 and Beyond     AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2014 and beyond: · Emphasis on customers; · Growth and profitability in our core insurance businesses; · Enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality; · Manage our capital more efficiently and redeploy capital to areas that promote profitable growth; · Work with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in its capacity as our principal regulator; and · Pursue initiatives that continue to reduce expenses and improve efficiencies to best meet the needs of our customers, including centralizing work streams to lower‑cost locations and creating a more streamlined organization.     Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2014 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2013 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.  AIG Property Casualty Strategic initiatives and Outlook              Executive Overview     Growth and Business Mix — Grow higher value business to increase profitability and expand in attractive growth economies. Underwriting Excellence — Enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate with the risk assumed. Claims Best Practices — Improve claims practices, analytics and tools to improve customer service, increase efficiency and lower the loss ratio. Operating Expense Discipline — Apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of AIG Property Casualty’s global footprint. Capital Efficiency — Enhance capital management through initiatives to streamline AIG Property Casualty’s legal entity structure, optimize AIG Property Casualty’s reinsurance program and improve tax efficiency. Investment Strategy — Execute AIG Property Casualty’s investment strategy, which includes increased asset diversification and yield‑enhancement opportunities that meet AIG Property Casualty’s liquidity, capital, risk and return objectives.          87       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Market Conditions and Industry Trends           AIG Property Casualty expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels, currency volatility, and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets. Due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, AIG Property Casualty has sought to modify terms and conditions, grow profitable segments of the business, exit unprofitable businesses and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability. AIG Property Casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. In recent years, AIG Property Casualty has benefitted from favorable pricing trends, particularly in its U.S. commercial business. However, such trends have tapered off in recent quarters. The property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets. AIG Property Casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions. Since the second quarter of 2014, within the U.S. commercial property business, AIG Property Casualty observed continued rate pressure in the U.S. Excess and Surplus lines market, particularly with respect to its natural catastrophe exposed business. AIG Property Casualty continues to differentiate its capacity from its peers through leveraging management’s significant experience with catastrophic events, providing loss prevention expertise and maintaining discipline in pricing to internal targets despite intense competition. In the U.S., AIG Property Casualty’s exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA is set to expire on December 31, 2014. AIG Property Casualty is closely monitoring the legislative developments related to the TRIPRA renewal or expiration, and has implemented appropriate business strategies for potential legislation outcomes, including non‑renewal of the law. For additional information on TRIPRA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reserves and Exposures and Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance Risks — Terrorism Risk in the 2013 Annual Report. AIG Property Casualty discounts loss reserves on certain lines of business, in a manner consistent with rates and factors approved or prescribed on an annual basis by state regulatory authorities. In the fourth quarter of 2014, AIG Property Casualty will seek approval from the authorities to update the discount rate to reflect interest rates then in effect. Strategic Initiatives          Growth and Business Mix            AIG Property Casualty continues efforts to better segment its business by industry, geography and type of coverage in order to enhance its decision making regarding risk acceptance and pricing. For example, within workers’ compensation, AIG Property Casualty has observed different experience and trends based on this segmentation, which helps inform its risk appetite, pricing and loss mitigation decisions.   On August 6, 2014, AIG announced that it has agreed to acquire Ageas Protect Limited (Ageas Protect) from Ageas Group, a Belgium-based international insurer. Total transaction consideration is approximately $293 million, subject to closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 or early 2015, pending regulatory approval. Ageas Protect is a leading provider of life protection products in the United Kingdom, offering term life, critical illness, and income protection coverage to consumers. Ageas Protect will become part of AIG’s global consumer business, which in the United Kingdom offers personal accident, health, and travel insurance coverage to consumers, as well as customized insurance solutions for high net worth individuals through AIG Private Client Group.      88       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      As part of AIG Property Casualty’s strategy to expand its consumer operations in growth economies, on May 29, 2013, AIG Property Casualty entered into a joint venture agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company Limited (PICC Life), a subsidiary of the People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group), to form an agency distribution company in China to distribute life and retirement products. The joint venture company distributes jointly developed life and retirement insurance products, existing PICC Life products, PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) insurance products, AIG Property Casualty products, as well as other products aimed at meeting the needs of this developing market. AIG owns 24.9 percent of the joint venture company with PICC Life holding the remaining 75.1 percent. AIG’s participation in the joint venture is managed by AIG Property Casualty. The joint venture commenced operations in March 2014. AIG Property Casualty continues to explore other potential life insurance and accident and health opportunities internationally. Capital Efficiency            AIG Property Casualty continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad‑based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, AIG Property Casualty remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency, which may lead to periodic income statement volatility. AIG Property Casualty also continues to streamline its legal entity structure to enhance transparency for regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. The legal entity restructuring initiatives have enhanced AIG Property Casualty’s dividend capacity, reduced required capital, and provided tax benefits. Additionally, the restructurings allow AIG Property Casualty to simplify its reinsurance arrangements, which further facilitates increased capital optimization. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, AIG Property Casualty completed the integration of its Japan operations through the conversion of the American Home Assurance Company’s Japan branch to a subsidiary of the Japan holding company effective on April 1, 2014. AIG Property Casualty expects its overall legal entity restructuring to be substantially completed in 2015, subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions. AIG LifE AND RETIREMENT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND Outlook              Executive Overview     Product Diversity and Capacity for Growth – Continue to expand AIG Life and Retirement’s comprehensive portfolio with superior, differentiated product solutions designed to meet consumer needs for financial and retirement security, using scale and capital strength to pursue growth opportunities.  Integrated Distribution – Grow assets under management by leveraging an extensive distribution organization of over 300,000 financial professionals and expanding relationships with key distribution partners to effectively market diverse product offerings across multiple channels under a more unified branding strategy.  Investment Portfolio – Maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that largely match the duration characteristics of liabilities with assets of comparable duration, and pursue yield-enhancement opportunities that meet liquidity, risk and return objectives.  Operational Initiatives – Continue to streamline life insurance and annuity operations and systems into a lower-cost, more agile model that provides superior service and ease of doing business.  Effective Risk and Capital Management – Deliver solid earnings through disciplined pricing and diversification of risk and increase capital efficiency within life insurance entities to enhance return on equity.           89       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Baby boomers reaching retirement age expect to live longer in retirement and place less reliance on traditional pensions and government retirement benefits than previous generations. These demographic trends, combined with favorable equity markets and low volatility, have provided a favorable environment for sales of individual variable annuities, and have contributed to growth in separate account assets under management in the Retirement Income Solutions product line. An increasing demographic of Americans approaching retirement and seeking guaranteed income features, combined with changes in the competitive landscape, provide opportunities to continue growing AIG Life and Retirement’s position in the individual variable annuities market. The interest rate environment has a significant impact on the life and annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products such as fixed annuities, and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. Low interest rates may also affect future investment margins, and may affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC assets in variable annuity, fixed annuity and universal life businesses. The modest increase in rates since the first quarter of 2013 provided some improvement in demand for fixed annuity products in the first half of 2014, but long-term interest rates have continued to remain low relative to historical levels. As long as the sustained low interest rate environment continues, market conditions will be challenging, particularly for the fixed annuity market. AIG Life and Retirement will continue to actively manage renewal and new business crediting rates. Also, as market conditions change, asset and liability interest rate exposures and strategic asset allocation are managed to emphasize lower or higher durations in the investment portfolio.  Product Diversity and Capacity for Growth           AIG Life and Retirement has been able to meet the demand for guaranteed products and grow sales while managing risk, by offering competitive products with strong de-risking features, such as volatility control funds, rider fees indexed to a market volatility index and required minimum allocations to fixed accounts and to the volatility control funds, and using a dynamic risk management hedging program. In addition to individual variable annuities, the Retirement Income Solutions product line is expanding the offerings of index annuities, including those with guarantee features, to provide additional income solutions for consumers approaching retirement. Sales in the Fixed Annuities product line improved in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year but were dampened in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 by the continued low interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits.  Industry sales of individual life products have continued an overall downward trend. AIG Life and Retirement is targeting growth by offering differentiated product solutions to better meet consumer needs, and by expanding distribution of life products through new channels and relationships, while maintaining pricing discipline as an integral component of its overall strategy.  The Institutional Markets product line is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management from increased stable value wrap business in the defined contribution market as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to the terminal funding and pension buyout business.     90       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Other Operations strategic initiatives and OUTLOOK         Mortgage Guaranty (UGC)            Executive Overview     Superior Risk Selection – Ensure the high quality of UGC’s new business through disciplined underwriting by using its proprietary multi-variant risk-based pricing model. UGC’s pricing model is based on a comprehensive range of risk attributes to generate a price reflecting the credit risk of each loan. Customer focus – Provide exceptional service and transparency to all customers through collaboration and continuous innovation that enhances the mortgage origination process. Product Selection – Provide a complete and competitively priced mortgage insurance product line that delivers flexible submission options and innovative solutions. Expense Management – Streamline UGC’s processes through the use of technology and shared services.    Market Conditions and Industry Trends         Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, higher residential mortgage interest rates reduced refinancing activity. However, in the third quarter of 2014, the rate of decline in new insurance written was reduced as residential mortgage interest rates began to stabilize. UGC  anticipates that new insurance written for the remainder of 2014 and 2015 will continue to be impacted by rate volatility as well as competition in the market place.  While higher  residential  mortgage  interest  rates  have  had  an  unfavorable  impact  on  new  mortgage  loan  volumes,  particularly on refinancing  activity,  UGC  expects  current  residential  mortgage  interest  rates  to  have  a  favorable  impact  on  the  persistency of business  written  from  2011  through  2013  since  refinancing  of  mortgage  loans  would  be  unattractive  to  homeowners  who originated mortgages  at  the  historically  low  residential  mortgage  interest  rates  prevalent  during  that  period.  UGC  expects  that this higher  persistency  will  continue  to  benefit  its  results  throughout  2014  and  into  2015.  UGC also  expects  that  newly  reported  delinquencies  will  decline  during  2014  and  into  2015  and  cure  rates  will  improve  as  a result of  home  value  appreciation,  which  will  encourage  homeowners  with  delinquent  mortgages  to  refinance  or  sell  and purchase another  home.  UGC  believes  the  combination  of  higher  persistency,  lower  new  delinquencies  and  improving  cure rates, partially  offset  by  a  decline  in  new  mortgage  loan  volumes,  will  result  in  favorable  operating  results  for  UGC  for the remainder of 2014 and into 2015. UGC’s  continued  success,  as  well  as  the  success  of  the  mortgage  insurance  industry,  can  be  significantly  affected  by  changes in regulatory  and  legislative  developments  and  changes  in  the  charters  and  business  practices  of  Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie Mae (collectively,  the  GSEs).  On July  10,  2014,  the  GSEs  issued  in  draft  form  for  public  comment  new  eligibility  requirements  used  to  approve  private mortgage insurers  that  provide  insurance  on  loans  owned  or  guaranteed  by  the  GSEs.  It  is  unclear  what  the  final  eligibility requirements will  be;  however,  if  adopted  as  issued,  new  requirements  would  include,  among  other  things,  higher  capital requirements and  heightened  liquidity  requirements.  The National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners  (the  NAIC)  has  begun  drafting  a  new  model  law  for  mortgage  insurance. A primary  focus  of  the  NAIC’s  effort  is  to  develop  a  risk  based  capital  (RBC)  model  that  will  replace  or  supplement  the  current 25:1 risk-to-surplus  requirements.  This  RBC  model  law  may  impact  the  amount  of  statutory  surplus  certain  UGC  subsidiaries must maintain.  In  addition,  the  new  model  law  may  have  an  impact  on  various  other  business  practices,  such  as  underwriting and claims  mitigation  practices  in  addition  to  possible  impacts  on  liquidity  and  other  financial  thresholds.      91       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      UGC cannot  predict  the  potential  effects  new  GSE  eligibility  requirements  and  a  new  model  law  may  have  on  its  business, results of  operations,  cash  flows  and  financial  condition.  Strategic Initiatives         Risk Selection         For the  remainder  of  2014  and  into  2015,  UGC  expects  to  continue  to  be  a  leading  private  provider  of  mortgage  insurance and to  differentiate  itself  from  its  competitors  by  providing  superior  service  and  products  to  its  customers  by  utilizing  its proprietary risk-based  pricing  strategy.  This  pricing  strategy  provides  UGC’s  customers  with  mortgage  insurance  products  that are priced  commensurate  with  the  underwriting  risk,  which  UGC  believes  will  result  in  an  appropriately  priced, high-quality book of business.  UGC  plans  to  continue  to  execute  this  strategy  throughout  2014 and into 2015. The business generated under this strategy, which was initiated during 2009, accounted for approximately 69 percent of net premiums earned in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. Global Capital Markets         AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. The derivative portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives. The remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the DIB and a portion of the legacy hedges for AIG and its subsidiaries. AIGFP’s derivatives portfolio consists primarily of interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity derivatives. Additionally, AIGFP has a credit default swap portfolio that is being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistently with our risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. Direct Investment Book         The DIB consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the MIP and certain non‑derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives. The DIB’s assets consist primarily of cash, short‑term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, U.S. government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. The value of these assets is impacted by macro‑economic trends in U.S. and core European markets, including corporate credit spreads, commercial and residential real estate markets, and to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, among other factors. The majority of these assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings. The DIB’s liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short‑term financing obligations. The DIB has both liabilities held at cost and liabilities held at fair value. The liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in AIG’s credit spreads with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Changes in the fundamental drivers of the fair value of DIB assets and liabilities will create earnings volatility for the DIB on a period‑to‑period comparative basis.      92       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following section provides a comparative discussion of our Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.

Income from continuing operations before income tax expense was $9.8 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $7.2 billion in the same period in the prior year and reflected pre-tax income from insurance operations of $4.0 billion, $4.4 billion and $423 million from AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Mortgage Guaranty in the      93       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to pre-tax income of $3.9 billion, $4.5 billion and $162 million for these operations in the same period in the prior year, respectively.  See the business segment discussions that follow for an analysis of results for these operations. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.2 percent and 29.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax-exempt interest income, income excludable from gross income related to the global resolution of certain residential mortgage-related disputes and a decrease in AIG Life and Retirement’s capital loss carryforward valuation allowance. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was (82.3) percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, effective settlements of certain uncertain tax positions and decreases primarily in AIG Life and Retirement’s capital loss carryforward valuation allowance and certain other valuation allowances associated with foreign jurisdictions. The decrease in the capital loss carryforward valuation allowance was primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains on sales of AIG Life and Retirement’s available‑for‑sale securities. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, these items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.

For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 33.1 percent and 27.7 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.

Factors that affect pre-tax operating income for a specific business segment are discussed in the detailed business segment analysis.     96       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Quarterly and Year-to-date Pre-tax Income Comparison for 2014 and 2013 AIG Property Casualty – Pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher net investment income, improved loss experience in Consumer Insurance, a lower Commercial Insurance current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reduced severe losses and an increase in net realized capital gains were partially offset by higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. In addition, AIG Property Casualty incurred higher general operating expenses primarily due to an increase in technology-related expenses. Pre-tax income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in underwriting loss as well as a decrease in net investment income that were more than offset by an increase in net realized capital gains. The increase in underwriting loss resulted from an increase in the frequency of severe losses, mostly in Commercial Insurance, higher adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by improved claim experience in Consumer Insurance and a reserve discount benefit. AIG Life and Retirement – Pre-tax income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income, legal settlement proceeds and lower loss recognition expense primarily attributable to sales in the prior year period related to capital loss carryforward utilization, partially offset by lower net realized capital gains. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, pre-tax income was lower than the same period in the prior year, as the decrease in net realized capital gains (losses) more than offset the increases from lower loss recognition expense, improved pre-tax operating income and higher legal settlement proceeds. Pre-tax income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included net realized capital losses from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges, primarily as a result of decreases in interest rates. Pre-tax income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 included significant net realized capital gains primarily due to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization. Other Operations – Pre‑tax income improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a gain on sale of divested business related to the sale of ILFC and declines in interest expense from ongoing debt management activities. The pre-tax income improvement for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 reflected increases in pre-tax income from GCM and the DIB while the pre-tax income improvement for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 was partially offset by decreases in pre-tax income from GCM and the DIB.  GCM’s pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior CDS portfolio and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by declines in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities. GCM’s pre-tax income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to declines in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities and declines in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior CDS portfolio, partially offset by gains realized upon unwinding certain positions and a decrease in operating expenses. As previously disclosed, a state regulatory agency has requested additional information relating to the unwinding of a position on which we realized gains of $196 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. The DIB’s pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher fair value appreciation on asset-backed security (ABS) collateralized debt obligation (CDOs), an increase in net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected and lower interest expense on borrowings resulting from redemptions and repurchases of DIB debt in 2014. The increase in pre-tax income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt. The DIB’s pre-tax income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt.     97       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following table presents reconciliations of pre-tax income (loss) to pre-tax operating income (loss) by reportable segment and after-tax operating income attributable to AIG, which are non-GAAP measures.

Commercial Insurance provides insurance solutions for large and small businesses. Commercial Insurance products are primarily distributed through a network of independent retail and wholesale brokers, and through an independent agency network. Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Products are distributed primarily through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations such as bancassurance, and the internet. The Other category consists primarily of run‑off lines of business, including excess workers’ compensation, asbestos and legacy environmental (1986 and prior); certain environmental liability businesses written prior to 2004; operations and expenses not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments; unallocated net investment income; net realized capital gains and losses; other income and expense items; and adverse loss development, net of the related amortization of deferred gains for a retroactive reinsurance arrangement.  See Part I, Item 1. Business – AIG Property Casualty in AIG’s 2013 Annual Report for further discussion of AIG Property Casualty’s products and geographic regions where it distributes its products. AIG Property Casualty continues to enhance the value‑based metrics that provide management with enhanced measures to evaluate its profitability, such as a risk‑adjusted profitability model. Along with underwriting results, this risk‑adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital and net investment income. AIG Property Casualty believes that such performance measures will allow it to better assess the true economic returns of its business. AIG Property Casualty Quarterly and Year-to-Date 2014 Highlights           Pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher net investment income, improved loss experience in Consumer Insurance, a lower Commercial Insurance current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and reduced severe losses were partially offset by higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. In addition, AIG Property Casualty incurred higher general operating expenses primarily due to an increase in technology-related expenses, including strategic and infrastructure improvement expenses, partially offset by lower employee-related and other operating expenses.  Pre-tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the frequency of severe losses, higher adverse prior year loss reserve development, higher catastrophe losses and a decrease in net investment income, which were partially offset by improved accident year claim experience in Consumer Insurance.  Net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to growth in Commercial Insurance. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and additional premiums on loss sensitive business, net premiums written increased by approximately three percent and two percent for Commercial Insurance in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting new business growth in Commercial Insurance, particularly in Property and Financial lines. Consumer Insurance net premiums written declined in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, due to the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased by approximately two percent and three percent for Consumer      100       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      Insurance in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting growth in AIG Fuji Life and personal property in both Japan and U.S., partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. warranty business and decreases in certain classes of A&H business due to strict underwriting discipline. The loss ratio increased by 0.4 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses which were largely offset by an improvement in accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. The improvement in Commercial Insurance accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was primarily due to an improvement in Financial lines as well as lower severe losses. The improvement in the Consumer Insurance accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was primarily due to rate increases, improved claim experience in the Japan automobile business, and rate actions and coverage changes in the U.S. warranty business.  The loss ratio increased by 0.2 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the frequency of severe losses and higher catastrophe losses as well as higher adverse prior year loss reserve development. These were partially offset by an improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in Consumer Insurance and an increase in discount for certain workers’ compensation reserves in Commercial Insurance. The increase in discount for these reserves improved the loss ratio by approximately 0.5 points compared to the same period in the prior year.  The acquisition ratio decreased by 0.3 points and 0.2 points in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities, and lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.3 points and 0.1 point in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in technology-related expenses partially offset by lower employee-related and other operating expenses. In addition, general operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 included the expense of the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan. Net investment income increased by four percent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in returns on alternative investments partially offset by the effects of lower reinvestment yields compared to interest rates on matured or sold investments and lower income on investments accounted for under the fair value option. Net investment income decreased by two percent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower income on investments accounted for under the fair value option and the effects of lower reinvestment yields compared to interest rates on matured or sold investments partially offset by higher returns on alternative investments. Dividends paid by AIG Property Casualty to AIG Parent in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities were $800 million and $1.5 billion during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. Additionally, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, AIG Property Casualty paid other non-cash dividends of $178 million to AIG Parent.     101       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      AIG Property Casualty Results          The following table presents AIG Property Casualty results:        Three Months Ended                    Nine Months Ended                      September 30,       Percentage           September 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2014       2013        Change                2014       2013        Change          Commercial Insurance                                                                 Underwriting results:                                                                 Net premiums written   $    5,496    $    5,222         5    %       $    16,308    $    16,001         2    %     Increase in unearned premiums        (152)         (80)         (90)                 (657)         (658)         -

AIG Property Casualty Quarterly Results Pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher net investment income, improved loss experience in Consumer Insurance, a lower Commercial Insurance current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and reduced severe losses were partially offset by higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development including related premium adjustments was $227 million and $70 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Catastrophe losses were $284 million and $222 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The current accident year losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 included nine severe losses totaling $188 million compared to seven severe losses totaling $211 million in the same period in the prior year. Net investment income increased due to an increase in returns on alternative investments, which was partially offset by the effects of lower reinvestment yields compared to the interest rates on matured or sold investments and lower income on investments accounted for under the fair value option. Acquisition expenses increased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in production in Commercial Insurance that was largely offset by a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities as well as lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments.  General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in technology-related expenses partially offset by reductions in employee-related and other operating expenses.  AIG Property Casualty Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in underwriting loss as well as a decrease in net investment income. The increase in      103       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      underwriting loss resulted from an increase in the frequency of severe losses, mostly in Commercial Insurance, higher adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by improved claim experience in Consumer Insurance and a reserve discount benefit. See Discounting of Reserves for further discussion of the discount benefit. The current accident year losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 included 28 severe losses totaling $567 million compared to 13 severe losses totaling $309 million in the same period in the prior year. Net adverse loss reserve development including related premium adjustments was $375 million and $172 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Catastrophe losses were $685 million and $579 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss reserve discount was a benefit of $90 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to a charge of $16 million in the same period in the prior year. Net investment income decreased due to lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option and the effects of lower reinvestment yields compared to the interest rates on matured or sold investments, which were partially offset by higher returns on alternative investments. Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, acquisition expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of change in business mix to higher value lines, which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities as well as lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments in Commercial Insurance. General operating expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in technology-related expenses partially offset by reductions in employee-related and other operating expenses. The employee-related expenses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, included a $42 million charge related to the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan. Commercial Insurance Quarterly Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Lower Commercial Insurance current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and reduced severe losses were more than offset by higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments, was $226 million and $102 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Catastrophe losses were $262 million and $182 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The current accident year losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 include severe losses of $188 million compared to severe losses of $211 million, which included a single severe loss consisting of property damage and related contingent business interruption claims, totaling $110 million, in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses increased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in production, which was largely offset by a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities. General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in employee-related and other operating expenses partially offset by increased technology-related expenses. Commercial Insurance Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in underwriting income and allocated net investment income. The decrease in underwriting income was due to higher accident year losses reflecting an increase in the frequency of severe losses in the Property and Specialty businesses, higher adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by a benefit in reserve discount. The current accident year losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 included 25 severe losses totaling $526 million compared to 13 severe losses totaling $309 million in the same period in the prior year. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments, was $323 million and      104       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      $218 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss reserve discount was a benefit of $158 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to no benefit in the prior year period. Catastrophe losses were $567 million and $522 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Allocated net investment income decreased primarily due to a reduction in net loss reserves and decreases in capital required to support the segment’s operations as a result of changes in the mix of business written. Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments as well as a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities. General operating expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in technology-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in employee-related and other operating expenses. In addition, general operating expenses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 included unusually low bad debt expense. Consumer Insurance Quarterly Results Pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in underwriting income. The increase in underwriting income reflected lower current accident year losses and a slight decrease in catastrophe losses partially offset by lower favorable prior year loss reserve development. Net favorable loss reserve development was $12 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to net favorable loss reserve development of $30 million in the same period in the prior year. Acquisition expenses remained unchanged in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Direct marketing expenses, which are included within acquisition expenses, excluding commissions were $109 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $110 million in the same period in the prior year. These expenses, while not deferrable, are expected to generate business that has an average expected overall persistency of approximately five years and, in Japan, approximately nine years. General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher expenses related to the ongoing integration of AIG Property Casualty’s Japan entities and investment in growth targeted areas, partially offset by a decrease in employee-related and other operating expenses. Consumer Insurance Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in underwriting income and allocated net investment income. The decrease in underwriting income was primarily due to higher catastrophe and severe losses and lower favorable prior year loss reserve development which were partially offset by improved claim experience in the Japan automobile business and rate actions and coverage changes in the U.S. warranty business. Catastrophe losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 were $118 million compared to $57 million in the same period in the prior year. Severe losses, which are included in current accident year losses, were $41 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to zero in the same period in the prior year. Net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $42 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to $125 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in allocated net investment income was due to a decline in risk-free rates used in AIG Property Casualty’s investment income allocation model. Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Direct marketing expenses excluding commissions, were $304 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to $335 million in the same period in the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, acquisition expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of change in business mix and higher costs in growth‑targeted lines of business.      105       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      General operating expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher expenses primarily related to the ongoing integration of AIG Property Casualty’s Japan entities which were partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange and a decrease in employee-related and other operating expenses.  Other Quarterly Results Pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated net investment income partially offset by an increase in general operating expenses. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development was $13 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to favorable development of $2 million in the same period in the prior year. General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher technology-related expenses. Other Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower allocated net investment income coupled with an increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development was $94 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $79 million in the same period in the prior year. General operating expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses partially offset by higher technology-related expenses. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, AIG Property Casualty incurred a $42 million charge related to the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan.

Commercial Insurance continued to focus on the execution of its strategic objectives.  AIG Property Casualty entered into a catastrophe bond reinsurance transaction, effective as of January 1, 2014, with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which provides AIG Property Casualty with up to $400 million of indemnity reinsurance protection against      107       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      U.S., Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. To fund its potential obligations to AIG Property Casualty, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued three tranches of notes. The transaction provides AIG Property Casualty with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through December 2016. However, the transaction has the effect of reducing net premiums written as further discussed below. Casualty net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to additional premium associated with prior year loss reserve development in the loss-sensitive business, which increased by $90 million. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange and additional premiums on loss sensitive business, net premiums written decreased by three percent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the declining rate environment and increased competition, coupled with the effect on renewals from AIG Property Casualty’s strategy to enhance risk selection, particularly in the Americas, which were partially offset by new business growth in EMEA.  Net premiums written decreased in nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the declining rate environment and increased competition, coupled with the effect on renewals from AIG Property Casualty’s strategy to enhance risk selection, particularly in the Americas. Strong growth and new writings in certain lines of business, particularly in EMEA, were more than offset by rate declines or market compression in others. Overall rate increases in retained business, especially in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset these rate declines. Property net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to new business increases in targeted growth products, improvement in retention in renewal business and changes to optimize AIG Property Casualty’s reinsurance structure as part of its decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure particularly in the U.S. and EMEA.  Net premiums written in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 reflected the effect of the catastrophe bond reinsurance transactions described above. Catastrophe bond reinsurance transactions reduced net premiums written by $56 million and $140 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Specialty net premiums written increased slightly in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflecting new business increases related to targeted growth products, including growth in small‑ and medium‑sized enterprise markets in the Americas region.  Financial lines net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products across all regions, as well as a favorable rate environment in the U.S.  Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Premiums Written Consumer Insurance net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year as the business continued to grow through multiple product and distribution channels. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, direct marketing accounted for approximately 15 percent and 16 percent of Consumer Insurance net premiums written, respectively. A&H net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in net premiums written was due to the continued growth of AIG Fuji Life, partially offset by decreases in certain classes of business due to strict underwriting discipline. Personal lines net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to new business sales and changes in reinsurance programs to retain more favorable business in Japan personal property, increased rates and improved retention in U.S. private client group, and continued growth of automobile business outside of Japan, partially offset by declines in the U.S. warranty business.     108       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      AIG Property Casualty Net Premiums Written by Region           The following table presents AIG Property Casualty’s net premiums written by region:                                        Percentage                                           Percentage             Three Months Ended        Percentage           Change in           Nine Months Ended        Percentage           Change in             September 30,       Change in           Original            September 30,       Change in           Original          (in millions)       2014       2013       U.S. dollars           Currency               2014       2013       U.S. dollars           Currency         Commercial Insurance:                                                                                         Americas   $    3,637    $    3,548         3    %        3    %       $    10,545    $    10,627         (1)    %        (1)    %     Asia Pacific        588         523         12             13                 1,545         1,540         -             6          EMEA        1,271         1,151         10             8                 4,218         3,834         10             8          Total net premiums written   $    5,496    $    5,222         5    %        5    %       $    16,308    $    16,001         2    %        2    %     Consumer Insurance:                                                                                         Americas   $    1,019    $    1,085         (6)    %        (4)    %       $    2,966    $    2,990         (1)    %        2    %     Asia Pacific        1,954         1,900         3             6                 5,635         5,858         (4)             3          EMEA        481         456         5             3                 1,598         1,515         5             3          Total net premiums written   $    3,454    $    3,441         -    %        2    %       $    10,199    $    10,363         (2)    %        3    %     Other:                                                                                         Americas   $    4    $    (3)        NM   %       NM   %       $    (6)    $    (4)         (50)    %       NM   %     Asia Pacific        (1)         -        NM           NM                (1)         -        NM           NM         Total net premiums written   $    3    $    (3)        NM   %       NM   %       $    (7)    $    (4)         (75)    %       NM   %     Total AIG Property Casualty:                                                                                         Americas   $    4,660    $    4,630         1    %        1    %       $    13,505    $    13,613         (1)    %        -    %     Asia Pacific        2,541         2,423         5             7                 7,179         7,398         (3)             4          EMEA        1,752         1,607         9             7                 5,816         5,349         9             7          Total net premiums written   $    8,953    $    8,660         3    %        4    %       $    26,500    $    26,360         1    %        2    %      WORLDWIDE NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN BY REGION (in millions)                109       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      AIG Property Casualty’s business is transacted in most major foreign currencies.

The Americas net premiums written decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in new business growth and rate pressure in Commercial Insurance, particularly in the Casualty business, as well as a decrease in U.S warranty business in Consumer Insurance. Additionally, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, the decrease in net premiums written was partially offset by the effect of catastrophe bond reinsurance transactions. Asia Pacific net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflecting growth in both Commercial and Consumer Insurance across all lines of businesses, particularly from Japan.  Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased, primarily due to growth of AIG Fuji Life and new business sales and changes in reinsurance programs to retain more favorable business in Japan personal property in Consumer Insurance.  EMEA net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to Commercial Insurance new business growth, particularly in Property, Casualty and Financial lines, and rate improvements on retained business, as well as growth in Consumer Insurance Personal lines, primarily in the automobile business.     110       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      AIG Property Casualty Underwriting Ratios           The following tables present the AIG Property Casualty combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:        Three Months Ended                Nine Months Ended                  September 30,       Increase       September 30,       Increase         2014       2013        (Decrease)        2014       2013        (Decrease)      Commercial Insurance                                                 Loss ratio    74.3         71.8         2.5         70.5         69.8         0.7      Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums    (4.9)         (3.5)         (1.4)         (3.6)         (3.4)         (0.2)      Prior year development net of premium adjustments    (4.9)         (2.1)         (2.8)         (2.4)         (1.8)         (0.6)      Net reserve discount benefit    0.3         -

Commercial Quarterly and Year-to-Date Insurance Ratios The combined ratio increased by 0.9 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to an increase in the loss ratio. The loss ratio increased by 2.5 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher adverse net prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. The combined ratio remained unchanged for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting an increase in the loss ratio offset by a decrease in the expense ratio.  The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 3.0 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a lower accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and an improvement in expense ratio. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.2 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 1.4 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an improvement in Financial lines and lower severe losses which were partially offset by an increase in frequency of non-severe losses in Property and Specialty business, particularly in the Americas and EMEA. Severe losses represented approximately 3.5 points and 4.1 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.9 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher frequency in severe losses, particularly in Property and Specialty businesses. Severe losses represented approximately 3.4 points and 2.0 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  The acquisition ratio decreased by 0.4 points and 0.5 points in the three- and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a reduction in expenses of personnel engaged in sales support activities, lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 1.2 points and 0.2 points in the three- and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to a decrease in employee-related and other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in technology-related expenses. In addition, the general operating expense ratio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 benefitted from unusually low bad debt expense. Consumer Quarterly and Year-to-Date Insurance Ratios The combined ratio decreased by 1.1 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a lower loss ratio, as discussed below. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, the combined ratio remained unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting a lower loss ratio offset by a higher expense ratio.     115       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 1.1 points and 1.4 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, due to lower accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 3.5 points and 2.5 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily as a result of rate increases and improved claim experience in the Japan automobile business, and rate actions and coverage changes in the U.S. warranty business. The severe losses of $41 million, resulting largely from three fire claims, accounted for 0.4 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. The acquisition ratio remained unchanged in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. The acquisition ratio increased by 0.3 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the combined effect of the change in business mix and higher acquisition costs in growth-targeted lines of business. The general operating expense ratio increased by 2.4 points and 0.8 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to higher expenses related to the ongoing integration of AIG Property Casualty’s Japan entities and investment in targeted growth areas, partially offset by a decrease in employee-related and other operating expenses.

Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as the Other category. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments. Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk‑free yields (plus a liquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributed to the Commercial Insurance or the Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to the Other category.  Net realized capital gains (losses) and Other income (expense) — net are not allocated to Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, but are reported as part of the Other category.     116       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Investment Income  Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including equity market performance, changes in overall asset allocation, changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows on certain structured securities, and the movements of interest rates. Net investment income increased by $52 million, or four percent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher income on alternative investments, driven by stronger equity market performance partially offset by lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option as well as a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest rates during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 was primarily offset by continued portfolio diversification, which helped mitigate the effects of higher interest rates on matured or sold investments versus reinvestment yields.  Net investment income decreased by $72 million, or two percent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option as the prior year period included a $58 million gain related to the PICC P&C rights offering in June 2013 and the effects of lower reinvestment yields partially offset by higher income on alternative investments. The decrease in interest rates during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 was primarily offset by continued portfolio diversification, which helped mitigate the effects of higher interest rates on matured or sold investments versus reinvestment yields. Corporate debt securities continued to be the largest asset category. AIG Property Casualty continued to focus on risk‑weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities and mortgage loans. In addition, AIG Property Casualty continued to maintain a defensive strategy on the rise of interest rates since the first quarter of 2013 by continuing to invest in floating rate securities. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of AIG Property Casualty’s fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. AIG Property Casualty expects to continue to refine its investment strategy during the remainder of 2014 to meet its liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. The fair value of AIG Property Casualty’s invested assets portfolio increased compared to December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in unrealized appreciation, which was driven by lower interest rates and the narrowing of investment grade credit spreads. Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) Net realized capital gains increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to gains on sales of securities, which were accomplished along with AIG Property Casualty’s portfolio diversification and derisking strategy. In addition to the higher overall gains on sales of securities, gains were also recorded on derivatives used to economically hedge foreign currency positions compared to losses in the same period in the prior year. AIG Property Casualty recognized other‑than‑temporary impairment charges of $18 million and $53 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, slightly higher than the same periods in the prior year.   Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense         The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for AIG Property Casualty, as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in Other Operations.     117       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense      The following table presents the components of AIG’s gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a U.S. statutory basis*:        September 30,   December 31,     (in millions)       2014       2013     Other liability occurrence (including asbestos and environmental)   $    19,856    $    21,023      International        17,223         17,126      Workers' compensation (net of discount)        14,756         15,390      Other liability claims made        10,252         10,645      Property        3,683         4,111      Auto liability        2,502         2,581      Products liability        1,453         1,463      Medical malpractice        1,587         1,714      Mortgage guaranty / credit        1,104         1,348      Accident and health        1,340         1,378      Commercial multiple peril        1,886         1,886      Aircraft        1,424         1,276      Fidelity/surety        545         538      Other        1,063         1,068      Total   $    78,674    $    81,547     * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for incurred but not reported (IBNR) and loss expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. AIG Property Casualty regularly reviews and updates the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pre‑tax operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by estimated salvage and subrogation, reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance, and applicable discount for future investment income. The following table presents the components of net loss reserves:                            September 30,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2014       2013     Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount                       $    82,319    $    85,102      Less: discount                            (3,645)         (3,555)      Gross loss reserves, net of discount, before reinsurance                            78,674         81,547      Less: reinsurance recoverable*                            (16,310)         (17,231)      Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                       $    62,364    $    64,316     * Includes $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of reinsurance recoverable under a retroactive reinsurance agreement at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $12.4 billion and $12.0 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles, primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business, where AIG Property Casualty manages and pays the entire claim on behalf of the insured and is reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, AIG Property Casualty held collateral totaling $9.6 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and assets in trusts.     118       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense      The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit(a):        September 30,   December 31,     (in millions)       2014       2013     AIG Property Casualty:                     Commercial Insurance                     Casualty   $    33,730    $    34,494      Financial lines        9,644         9,803      Specialty        5,660         5,485      Property        4,157         4,293      Total Commercial Insurance(b)        53,191         54,075      Consumer Insurance                     Personal lines        2,994         3,385      Accident and health        2,016         2,094      Total Consumer Insurance(b)        5,010         5,479      Other        3,095         3,475      Total AIG Property Casualty        61,296         63,029      Other Operations - Mortgage Guaranty        1,068         1,287      Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense   $    62,364    $    64,316     (a) Excludes future policyholder benefits of $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.

This resulted in an additional workers’ compensation loss reserve discount benefit of approximately $110 million recorded during the first quarter of 2014. As a result of changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool, a portion of the workers’ compensation reserves that had been held in New York subsidiaries and discounted pursuant to New York discounting rules which generally do not permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves, are now held in Pennsylvania and Delaware subsidiaries and discounted pursuant to Pennsylvania and Delaware rules. Pennsylvania discounting rules permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and allow a variable discount rate for application to case reserves. AIG Property Casualty received a permitted practice from the Delaware Department of Insurance to allow discounting on the same basis as its Pennsylvania domiciled companies. Quarterly Reserving Conclusion         AIG net loss reserves represent our best estimate of our liability for net losses and loss expenses as of September 30, 2014. While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of September 30, 2014. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either      121       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense      favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, the net adverse prior year loss reserve development, net of premium accruals of $93 million, was $227 million, which was primarily driven by net adverse prior year loss reserve development in U.S. Commercial Insurance, partially offset by net favorable prior year loss reserve development in Consumer Insurance. The U.S. Commercial Insurance net adverse loss reserve development was primarily driven by Primary Casualty especially general liability and auto liability, partially offset by reserve decreases in Canada Casualty and Financial lines, as well as Natural catastrophes of $31 million. The net adverse prior year loss reserve development in Primary Casualty lines was primarily driven by several large construction defects claims and increased costs with New York labor law claims. Commercial auto liability had an increase in frequency of large claims in the accident years 2010 to 2013, where the economic recovery has contributed to increased frequency and severity of claims, especially for claims in excess of $500,000, which generally take several years to emerge and settle. The net favorable loss reserve development in Canada Casualty (including Primary and Excess Casualty business) and Financial lines was primarily due to our updated study reflecting the better than expected loss emergence over the last several calendar years. We completed an updated analysis of our U.S. Excess Casualty business (excluding Canada) in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 and while we have not changed our estimate of aggregate prior year losses, our revised business class segmentation led to lower 2005 and subsequent accident year estimates for non-mass tort claims where we expect underwriting actions and reductions to policy limits to have a favorable effect on ultimate losses from accident years 2007 to 2013 in particular. This was entirely offset by adverse development in our 2004 and prior year estimates as a result of updated loss development patterns for mass tort claims that we segmented more extensively from non-mass tort claims in this business class. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, the adverse prior year loss development, net of premium accruals of $157 million, was $375 million, which was driven by reserve increases on claims in U.S. Commercial Insurance and Other – U.S. The net adverse prior year loss reserve development in U.S. Commercial Insurance was driven by Primary Casualty and Specialty lines, partially offset by Natural catastrophes, while the adverse development in Other – U.S. was driven by adverse development on legacy pollution exposures (1986 and prior) and run-off environmental exposures (1987 – 2004). For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, the net adverse development, net of premium accruals of $3 million and $83 million, was $70 million and $172 million, respectively, which was driven by reserve increases on claims in U.S. Commercial Insurance and Other – U.S., partially offset by net favorable development in U.S. Consumer Insurance, International Commercial and International Consumer lines. The net adverse development in U.S. Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to domestic property exposures, mostly due to the increase in reserves for Storm Sandy, with adverse development in non-loss sensitive Primary Casualty lines, driven by higher than expected legal costs on claims for construction defects claims from accident years 2004 and prior. The adverse development on those classes was partially offset by case reductions on some large claims and favorable development on non-natural catastrophe Property business. The adverse development in Other – U.S. for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 included adverse development on legacy asbestos and environmental exposures (1986 and prior). In addition, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 included adverse development on run off environmental exposures (1987 – 2004).

As described more fully in the 2013 Annual Report, AIG Property Casualty’s reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive ground‑up and top-down analyses performed periodically. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, AIG Property Casualty increased its gross asbestos reserves by $29 million and the net asbestos reserves by $28 million primarily due to minor changes in estimates, accretion of discount, and anticipated uncollectible reinsurance. For the same period, AIG Property Casualty increased its gross environmental reserves by $121 million and its net environmental reserves by $52 million to reflect the results of a top-down analysis completed in the second quarter and a minor change in estimates in the third quarter. In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, AIG Property Casualty also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non‑U.S. entities of $137 million gross and $110 million net as of September 30, 2014. The asbestos reserves relating to non‑U.S. risks written by non‑U.S. entities were $134 million gross and $108 million net as of December 31, 2013.     123       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense      The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:    As of or for the Nine Months Ended September 30,               2014       2013     (in millions)                   Gross       Net       Gross       Net     Asbestos:                                                     Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                                                     at beginning of year                   $    4,720    $    529    $    4,896    $    427      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                                                     Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts                        -         123         -         89      Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive                                                     reinsurance contracts(a)                        -         (3)         -         (4)      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance                        -         120         -         85      Dispositions                        -         -         (12)         (12)      Loss and loss expenses incurred:                                                     Undiscounted                        (6)         11         (5)         4      Change in discount                        35         20         38         17      Losses and loss expenses incurred(b)                        29         31         33         21      Losses and loss expenses paid(b)                        (514)         (316)         (347)         (112)      Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                                                     at end of period                   $    4,235    $    364    $    4,570    $    409      Environmental:                                                     Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                                                     at beginning of year                   $    313    $    163    $    309    $    163      Dispositions                        -         -         (1)         (1)      Losses and loss expenses incurred                        121         52         61         38      Losses and loss expenses paid                        (40)         (25)         (69)         (43)      Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                                                      at end of period                   $    394    $    190    $    300    $    157      Combined:                                                     Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                                                      at beginning of year                   $    5,033    $    692    $    5,205    $    590      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                                                     Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts                        -         123         -         89      Re-estimation of amount recoverable under retroactive                                                     reinsurance contracts                        -         (3)         -         (4)      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance                        -         120         -         85      Dispositions                        -         -         (13)         (13)      Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                                     Undiscounted                        115         63         56         42      Change in discount                        35         20         38         17      Losses and loss expenses incurred                        150         83         94         59      Losses and loss expenses paid                        (554)         (341)         (416)         (155)      Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense                                                      at end of period                   $    4,629    $    554    $    4,870    $    566     (a) Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts includes effect of changes in reserve estimates and changes in discount.

Retail products are generally marketed directly to individual consumers through independent and career insurance agents, retail banks, direct-to-consumer platforms, and national, regional and independent broker-dealers. The primary products offered by the Retail segment include term and universal life insurance, A&H, individual fixed and variable annuities, retail mutual funds and advisory services. Institutional products are generally marketed to groups or large institutions through affiliated financial advisors or intermediaries including benefit consultants, independent marketing organizations, structured settlement brokers and broker-dealers. Institutional segment products include fixed and variable group annuities, group mutual funds, stable value wrap products, structured settlement and terminal funding annuities, high net worth products, corporate- and bank-owned life insurance, guaranteed investment contracts and a wide range of group benefit products. AIG Life and Retirement Quarterly and Year-to-date 2014 Highlights           Pre-tax operating income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 improved compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting higher fee income from growth in assets under management and higher alternative investment income. Pre-tax operating income in the three- and nine-month periods included a net positive adjustment of $120 million related to an annual review of actuarial assumptions, compared to a $118 million net positive adjustment in the same periods in the prior year. The $120 million net adjustment in the 2014 periods included a $207 million net increase in pre-tax operating income to update certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in the interest-sensitive product lines, partially offset by loss recognition expense of $87 million related to certain discontinued long-term care business. The $118 million net positive adjustment in the same periods in the prior year was exclusively related to the update of estimated gross profit assumptions. Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to strong returns on alternative investments. For both periods, compared to the same periods in the prior year, active crediting rate management and growth in invested assets largely offset the impact of lower investment yields.  Pre-tax income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income as discussed above, legal settlement proceeds and lower loss recognition expense attributable to reinvestment in the low interest rate environment, partially offset by lower net realized capital gains. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, pre-tax income was lower than the same period in the prior year, as the decrease in net realized capital gains (losses) more than offset the increases from lower loss recognition expense, improved pre-tax operating income and higher legal settlement proceeds. Pre-tax income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included realized capital losses from changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges, primarily as a result of decreases in interest rates. Pre-tax income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 included significant realized capital gains primarily due to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization. Premiums and deposits increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a stable value wrap funding agreement deposit in the Institutional Markets product line and continued strong demand for variable and index annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line. The increases in those product lines were partially offset by lower Retail Mutual Fund sales in the three-and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2014, and lower Fixed Annuities sales in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Higher surrenders and withdrawals in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, primarily in the Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Fund product lines, resulted in negative net flows in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 and a significant decrease in net flows for both periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. See AIG Life and Retirement – Premiums, Deposits and Net Flows for discussion of premiums, as well as net flows by product line.     125       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      Dividends and loan repayments paid by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries to AIG Parent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 were $1.7 billion, which included approximately $465 million of legal settlement proceeds. Dividends and loan repayments paid by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries to AIG Parent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 totaled $4.9 billion, which was comprised of $4.3 billion of cash and $642 million of preferred equity interests in two aircraft trust entities, and included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement distributed an additional $635 million to AIG Parent in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities in October 2014, which represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014.

Pre-tax operating income in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included a net positive adjustment of $120 million related to an annual review of actuarial assumptions, compared to a $118 million net positive adjustment in the same periods in the prior year. The adjustments in both years included updates of certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in the interest-sensitive product lines, which resulted in a $207 million net increase in pre-tax operating income in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to a $118 million net increase in pre-tax operating income in the same periods in the prior year. The net positive adjustment related to estimated gross profit assumptions in the 2014 periods was primarily due to higher investment spread and lower lapse assumptions in the Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement product lines than previously assumed, partially offset by higher mortality      127       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      assumptions for universal life insurance, which were still within pricing assumptions, and loss recognition expense of $87 million for certain discontinued long-term care business. See AIG Life and Retirement DAC and Reserves - Estimated Gross Profit Assumptions for Interest-Sensitive Products, and AIG Life and Retirement DAC and Reserves – Loss Recognition, for additional discussion. Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to strong returns on alternative investments, as well as higher call and tender income. For both the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year, higher investment income from growth in average invested assets was largely offset by lower base investment yield due to reinvestment in the sustained low interest rate environment. See AIG Life and Retirement Investments for additional discussion. Active crediting rate management has helped mitigate the impact of declining base yields on pre-tax operating income.  Advisory fees and other income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher volumes of advisory services, which were offered in the Brokerage Services, Retirement Income Solutions and Retail Mutual Fund product lines in the Retail operating segment. The increases in advisory fees and other income were partially offset by a related increase in advisory expense, which was the primary driver of the increase in other acquisition and insurance expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The remaining increase in other acquisition and insurance expense was largely due to non-deferrable expenses related to business growth. Pre-tax income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income as discussed above, legal settlement proceeds and lower loss recognition expense, which was primarily attributable to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization in the prior year period, partially offset by lower net realized capital gains. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, pre-tax income was lower than the same period in the prior year, as the decrease in net realized capital gains (losses) more than offset the increases from lower loss recognition expense attributable to investment sales, improved pre-tax operating income and higher legal settlement proceeds. Net realized capital gains (losses) reflect investment activity as well as the change in fair value of embedded derivatives primarily related to variable annuities with GMWB living benefit guarantee features, net of hedges. The decreases in net realized capital gains (losses) from investment activity in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 were primarily due to investment sales made during 2013 to utilize capital loss carryforwards. See AIG Life and Retirement Investments for additional discussion of realized capital gains (losses) on invested assets. Net realized capital gains (losses) from the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives primarily related to variable annuities with GMWB living benefit guarantee features, net of hedges, included net losses of $77 million and $412 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to net gains of $19 million and $150 million in the respective periods in the prior year. These embedded derivatives are primarily in the Retirement Income Solutions product line of the Retail operating segment and, to a lesser extent, in the Group Retirement product line of the Institutional operating segment. The embedded derivative fair value losses were partially offset by the rider fees collected for the embedded derivatives, which are reported in policy fees, and by increases in the fair value of U.S. Treasury bonds used to hedge interest rate risk, discussed below. The variance in net realized capital gains (losses) related to these embedded derivatives in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to adjustments to reflect the update of assumptions for these products, which were partially offset by DAC adjustments reported within changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses). The variance in net realized capital gains (losses) related to these embedded derivatives for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year included the change from the update of assumptions, and also reflected a decrease in interest rates offset by changes in the non-performance spread adjustment. The fair value calculation for these embedded derivatives reflects a market participant’s view of AIG Life and Retirement’s claims-paying ability by adjusting the interest rate swap curve used to discount the expected cash flows with an additional spread to reflect non-performance risk. This non-performance spread adjustment is derived from corporate credit spreads in the marketplace.      128       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      AIG Life and Retirement has a dynamic economic hedging program designed to manage risk exposure related to its guaranteed living benefit features from changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatilities. This program utilizes derivative instruments, including equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap contracts, as well as U.S. Treasury bonds. While a small portion of AIG Life and Retirement’s interest rate risk related to these products is unhedged, the majority of the interest rate exposure related to guaranteed living benefit features is hedged with derivative instruments and, to a lesser extent, with U.S. Treasury bonds, which AIG Life and Retirement began purchasing in 2012 as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce interest rate risk exposure over time. The hedging-related change in the fair value of the U.S. Treasury bonds is also excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported in changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities.  Loss recognition expense primarily attributable to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization was excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported in changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses). Such loss recognition expense for certain traditional product lines was less than $1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 and $21 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, in both cases significantly lower than $244 million and $1.5 billion in the three- and nine-month periods, respectively, in the prior year. Loss recognition recorded in the 2013 periods was primarily a result of proceeds from investment sales related to the program to utilize capital loss carryforwards that were reinvested in the low interest rate environment. See AIG Life and Retirement DAC and Reserves – Loss Recognition for additional discussion. Retail Quarterly and Year-to-date Results Pre-tax operating income for the Retail operating segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a $71 million net positive adjustment to update certain actuarial assumptions in the 2014 periods, compared to a $198 million net positive adjustment in the same periods in the prior year. The net adjustment related to the update of estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in the interest-sensitive product lines totaled $158 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, which was comprised of a $196 million net positive adjustment in the Fixed Annuities product line, primarily due to more favorable investment spread assumptions than previously assumed, and a $14 million net positive adjustment in Retirement Income Solutions, primarily due to improved mortality assumptions, partially offset by $52 million of net negative adjustments in the Life and A&H product line, which reflected higher mortality assumptions and, to a lesser extent, lower investment spreads. The net adjustment to update assumptions in the 2014 periods was also reduced by loss recognition expense of $87 million for certain discontinued long-term care business. The decrease in pre-tax operating income due to updated assumptions was partially offset by higher fee income in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, which reflected growth in assets under management driven by strong sales of variable annuities, positive net flows and favorable equity market performance, and by higher net investment income. Net investment income in the Retail operating segment for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to strong returns on alternative investments. For both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year, higher investment income from growth in average invested assets was largely offset by lower base investment yield due to reinvestment in the sustained low interest rate environment. Base spread (defined as base net investment income less interest credited) for the Fixed Annuities product line was stable in both of the 2014 periods compared to the same periods in the prior year, as declining base yields were partially offset by active crediting rate management and the run-off of older business with relatively high crediting rates.  DAC amortization expense for the Retail operating segment, excluding the portion of the adjustment to update estimated gross profit assumptions discussed above that reduced DAC amortization expense, increased compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, as the favorable impact of equity market performance reduced amortization expense in the prior year period but had a less significant impact on the same period in 2014. Advisory fees and other income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher volumes of advisory services, which were offered in the Brokerage Services, Retirement Income Solutions and Retail Mutual Fund product lines. The increase in advisory fee and other income was partially offset by a related increase in advisory expense, which is included in other acquisition and insurance expense.     129       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      Pre-tax income for the Retail operating segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year was reduced by lower pre-tax operating income discussed above, as well as fair value net losses in the current year periods on embedded derivatives primarily related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges, compared to fair value net gains in the same periods in the prior year. The variance in the embedded derivative fair value gains (losses) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to adjustments in both periods to update assumptions for these products. The variance in the embedded derivative fair value gains (losses) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year included the adjustments to update assumptions as well as a decrease in interest rates. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, these decreases in pre-tax income were more than offset by legal settlement proceeds. Fair value gains (losses) on embedded derivatives reported in net realized capital gains (losses) in the 2014 periods were partially offset by rider fees collected for the embedded derivatives, which are recorded in policy fees, and by changes in fair value of the U.S. Treasury bonds used to hedge interest rate risk related to these living benefit liabilities, which are also excluded from pre-tax operating income.  Institutional Quarterly and Year-to-date Results Pre-tax operating income for the Institutional operating segment increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a net positive adjustment of $49 million related to an annual review and update of certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for interest-sensitive products in both 2014 periods, compared to an $80 million net unfavorable adjustment in the same periods in the prior year. The adjustments in both the current and prior year periods were primarily in the Group Retirement product line, and the net positive adjustment in the 2014 periods was primarily due to more favorable annuity spread and lapse assumptions than previously assumed. Pre-tax operating income for the Institutional operating segment also reflected higher fee income and higher net investment income. The increase in fee income was driven by growth in assets under management, principally from favorable equity market performance and development of the stable value wrap business. Net investment income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments and higher call income. For both of the 2014 periods, compared to the same periods in the prior year, higher investment income from growth in average invested assets was largely offset by lower base investment yield due to reinvestment in the sustained low interest rate environment. Effective crediting rate management in the Group Retirement product line has helped offset the pressure on yields from reinvestment in the sustained low interest rate environment. Pre-tax income for the Institutional operating segment increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income, higher legal settlement proceeds and lower loss recognition expense, partially offset by lower net realized capital gains from investments sold in the 2013 periods to utilize capital loss carryforwards. Loss recognition expense in the 2013 periods was triggered primarily by reinvestment of proceeds from investment sales to utilize capital loss carryforwards. See AIG Life and Retirement DAC and Reserves – Loss Recognition for additional information. AIG Life and Retirement Investments                 Investments           AIG Life and Retirement invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. Income from these investments, as well as cash and short-term investments, is included in the measure of base net investment income, after excluding certain items such as call and tender income, mortgage prepayment fees, change in accretion of discount for certain high credit quality structured securities and impairment charges on investments in leased commercial aircraft.     130       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      In addition, AIG Life and Retirement seeks to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds, and affordable housing partnerships. AIG Life and Retirement’s investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, common and preferred stocks and yield-enhancement items, such as securities for which the fair value option has been elected. See MD&A - Investments for additional information on AIG Life and Retirement’s invested assets, investment strategy and asset-liability management process. Investment Yields           Overall, AIG Life and Retirement’s fixed maturity portfolio yields in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 declined compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and reinvestment of portfolio cash flows from investment sales, interest and maturities at yields lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio due to the sustained historically low interest rate environment. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, the decrease in base yield (calculated using base net investment income as defined above) reflected strong performance of commercial mortgage loans and structured securities in the prior year period, as well as the investment of proceeds from sales made during 2013 to offset capital loss carryforwards, at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio. Although portfolio yields continue to be under pressure from the investment of premiums, deposits and portfolio cash flows in the sustained low interest rate environment, AIG Life and Retirement expects to continue pursuing opportunities to maintain or increase yields without assuming additional credit risk through the purchase of less liquid asset classes, such as private placement debt, commercial mortgage loans and asset-backed securities. Net Investment Income           Quarterly Net Investment Income Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, including a $153 million increase in income from alternative investments primarily due to strong returns on hedge funds and $29 million higher call and tender income. Net gains on fair value option assets were $68 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to $74 million of net gains in the same period in the prior year, due to lower gains on fair value option bonds partially offset by higher gains from PICC Group. AIG Life and Retirement sold its interest in the PICC Group shares to AIG Parent on August 13, 2014. Base net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, as growth in invested assets was more than offset by lower base yield.  Year-to-Date Net Investment Income Net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, which included a $20 million increase in income from alternative investments, $19 million higher call and tender income and $7 million higher net gains on fair value option assets, partially offset by a reversal of accrued interest on restructured loans. Fair value option net gains were $48 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $41 million of net gains in the same period in the prior year, which reflected higher gains on fair value option bonds, partially offset by losses from PICC Group of $54 million in the 2014 period compared to losses of $39 million for the same period in the prior year. Base net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 was comparable to the same period in the prior year as growth in invested assets was offset by lower base yield. The current period included participation income on a commercial mortgage loan and income from the redemption of an asset classified in Other invested assets, while the same period in the prior year also benefitted from strong results in commercial mortgage loans and structured securities.     131       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      AIG Life and Retirement maintains investment portfolios for each product line which, to the extent practicable, match established duration targets based on the characteristics of liabilities. AIG Life and Retirement has not made significant changes during 2014 in the duration targets or credit quality of assets supporting its business lines. Net investment income from assets that support liabilities is allocated to the product line supported by those assets. Net investment income from investments in excess of liabilities, which include the majority of the alternative investments and fair value option assets, is allocated to the product lines using a capital-based internal allocation model. As a result, the variances in alternative investment income and fair value option assets discussed above were also reflected in net investment income of both the Retail and Institutional operating segments. Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)           The decreases in AIG Life and Retirement’s net realized capital gains in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year were largely due to investment sales made during 2013 to utilize capital loss carryforwards. Net capital gains on the sales of investments were $210 million and $406 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to $460 million and $2.1 billion in the same periods in the prior year. The realized gains in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included sales to monetize gains in certain long-held investment real estate. Other-than-temporary impairments remained at relatively low levels in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014. In addition to investment activity, AIG Life and Retirement’s net realized capital gains (losses) also reflect variability from the effect of changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in variable annuities with GMWB living benefit features and related hedges, primarily in the Retail operating segment. See AIG Life and Retirement Results for additional discussion of such activity. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities           The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called “NAIC Designations.” In general, NAIC Designations of “1” highest quality, or “2” high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of “3” through “6” generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of AIG Life and Retirement’s fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments – Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings. The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of AIG Life and Retirement categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:    September 30, 2014                                                                                 (in millions)                                                                                                                                                 Total                                     Total                                           Below                                     Investment                                           Investment             NAIC Designation       1       2       Grade           3       4       5       6       Grade       Total     Other fixed maturity securities   $    48,488    $    62,396    $    110,884        $    4,772    $    2,259    $    287    $    118    $    7,436    $    118,320      Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized        40,974         1,919         42,893             754         482         245         756         2,237         45,130      Total*   $    89,462    $    64,315    $    153,777        $    5,526    $    2,741    $    532    $    874    $    9,673    $    163,450     * Excludes $1.0 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within AIG Life and Retirement that require a statutory filing.     132       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of AIG Life and Retirement categorized by composite AIG credit rating, at fair value:    September 30, 2014                                                                         (in millions)                                                                                                                                 Total                                     Total                                   Below                                     Investment                           CCC and       Investment             Composite AIG Credit Rating       AAA/AA/A       BBB       Grade           BB       B       Lower       Grade       Total     Other fixed maturity securities   $    48,137    $    63,206    $    111,343        $    4,263    $    2,403    $    311    $    6,977    $    118,320      Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized        25,734         3,036         28,770             1,442         1,759         13,159         16,360         45,130      Total*   $    73,871    $    66,242    $    140,113        $    5,705    $    4,162    $    13,470    $    23,337    $    163,450     * Excludes $1.0 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within AIG Life and Retirement that require a statutory filing. AIG Life and Retirement DAC and Reserves           The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in AIG Life and Retirement DAC:    Nine Months Ended September 30,                 (in millions)               2014       2013     Balance, beginning of year           $    6,723    $    5,672      Acquisition costs deferred                759         665      Amortization expense                (497)         (489)      Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments                (361)         661      Balance, end of period*           $    6,624    $    6,509     * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $8.1 billion and $7.7 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing contracts for investment-oriented products are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.  In the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, AIG Life and Retirement completed its annual review and update of estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for its interest-sensitive products. The result of this review was a $207 million net positive adjustment to pre-tax operating income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, including $158 million in the Retail operating segment and $49 million in the Institutional operating segment. The net positive adjustment in the Retail operating segment included $196 million in the Fixed Annuities product line, primarily due to better investment spreads than previously assumed, and $14 million in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, primarily due to improved mortality assumptions, partially offset by $52 million of net negative adjustments in the Life and A&H product line, due to lower investment spread and higher mortality assumptions. The updated mortality assumptions are still within pricing assumptions. The net positive adjustment in the Institutional segment was primarily due to more favorable assumptions for investment spreads and surrender rates in the Group Retirement product line than previously assumed. These adjustments do not include loss recognition on long-term care products; see AIG Life and Retirement DAC and Reserves – Loss Recognition for additional discussion of the update of assumptions for long-term care products.      133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      The $207 million net positive adjustment included in pre-tax operating income in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 to reflect updated actuarial assumptions was comprised of a $165 million net decrease in DAC amortization expense, a $93 million decrease in SIA amortization expense within interest credited to policyholder account balances and a $27 million increase in unearned revenue amortization within policy fees, partially offset by a $78 million increase in liabilities for future policy benefits for life and health insurance contracts and policyholder contract deposits. The net adjustment to DAC amortization represented less than 2 percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of September 30, 2014. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, AIG Life and Retirement’s annual review and update of the estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a $118 million net increase in pre-tax operating income, which included a $198 million increase in the Retail operating segment and an $80 million decrease in the Institutional operating segment. The net increase in Retail pre-tax operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 was primarily due to favorable adjustment in the Fixed Annuities product line due to active spread management of crediting rates and higher future investment yields than those previously assumed. The updates of variable annuity spreads, surrender rates and life insurance mortality assumptions had an unfavorable impact on the pre-tax operating income of the Life Insurance and A&H, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013. The $118 million net increase in the 2013 pre-tax operating income to reflect the update of assumptions was comprised of $98 million net decrease in DAC amortization expense, a $61 million decrease in SIA amortization expense within interest credited to policyholder account balances, and a $28 million increase in unearned revenue amortization within the policy fees, partially offset by a $69 million increase in future policy benefits for life and health insurance contracts. The net adjustment to DAC amortization represented less than 2 percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of September 30, 2013. The update of actuarial assumptions also included a $27 million net negative adjustment and a $61 million net positive adjustment in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to updated mortality assumptions for GMWB embedded derivative liabilities, which resulted in a negative adjustment of $32 million and a positive adjustment of $82 million reported in net realized capital gains (losses) in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, partially offset by DAC adjustments reported within changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses). Reversion to the Mean In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a “reversion to the mean” methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption will impact the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period remaining below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods.  For variable annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five-year reversion to the mean period and therefore has not met the criteria for adjustment; however, additional favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in “unlocking” in this product line in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.  DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in DAC related to unrealized appreciation of      134       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      investments generally moves in the opposite direction of the changes in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio. The increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 of $5.1 billion, which were driven by the decline in market interest rates, resulted in a decrease in DAC and an increase in shadow loss reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments. Shadow loss reserves were insignificant at December 31, 2013 and increased to $850 million at September 30, 2014. The change in this component of DAC and shadow loss reserves in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 was greater than the change in the same period of the prior year, due to a larger movement in unrealized appreciation of investments.

Loss recognition attributable primarily to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization was excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported within changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) in the AIG Life and Retirement Results table herein.  In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, AIG Life and Retirement recorded loss recognition expense of $87 million to increase reserves for certain discontinued long-term care business, primarily as a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, to a lesser extent, lower yield assumptions. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves. AIG Life and Retirement does not currently offer long-term care products. Sales of investment securities in connection with the program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition expense, primarily on certain long-term payout annuity contracts, of less than $1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 and $21 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, which was significantly lower than $244 million and $1.5 billion in the respective three- and nine-month periods in the prior year.  Shadow loss recognition was insignificant at December 31, 2013 and increased to $850 million at September 30, 2014 primarily due to the increase in unrealized appreciation of investments during the nine-month period. Spread Management   The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may have the effect, in a sustained low interest rate environment, of reducing spreads and thus reducing future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through AIG Life and Retirement’s asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. Disciplined pricing on new business is used to continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads in the current low interest rate environment. AIG Life and Retirement has a dynamic product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that AIG Life and Retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, existing products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance product regulations. · New sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent. · Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and zero to 2 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficiently low to meet targeted net investment spreads. AIG Life and Retirement is in the process of lowering the minimum guaranteed interest rates on new universal life products, and expects this process to be substantially completed in 2014.     136       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions in annuity and universal life products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. AIG Life and Retirement has adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in-force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees. In addition to annuity and universal life products, certain traditional long-duration products for which AIG Life and Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, expose AIG Life and Retirement to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment. See AIG Life and Retirement Reserves – Loss Recognition for additional discussion of loss recognition. As of September 30, 2014, AIG Life and Retirement’s universal life and annuity products had minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products. As indicated in the table below, approximately 70 percent of annuity and universal life account values were at their minimum crediting rates as of September 30, 2014, compared to 73 percent at December 31, 2013. As a result of disciplined pricing on new business and the run-off of older business with higher minimum interest crediting rates, fixed annuity account values having contractual minimum guaranteed rates above 1 percent decreased from 84 percent at December 31, 2013 to 80 percent at September 30, 2014.

Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance, investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds. The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:            Three Months Ended           Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       September 30,         (in millions)           2014       2013           2014       2013         Premiums and deposits       $    9,662    $    8,422        $    24,151    $    20,767          Deposits            (8,927)         (7,543)             (21,926)         (18,304)          Other            (136)         (158)             (329)         (473)          Premiums        $    599    $    721        $    1,896    $    1,990         Premiums decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower terminal funding annuity and structured settlement premiums in the Institutional Markets product line. The decrease in premiums for those product lines in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 was partially offset by higher immediate annuity premiums in the Fixed Annuities product line. The following table presents premiums and deposits by operating segment and product line:        Three Months Ended                   Nine Months Ended                         September 30,       Percentage               September 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2014       2013       Change               2014       2013       Change         Retail                                                                 Life Insurance and A&H   $    807    $    822         (2)    %       $    2,470    $    2,497         (1)    %     Fixed Annuities        692         1,188         (42)                 2,713         1,919         41          Retirement Income Solutions        2,887         2,460         17                 7,630         6,106         25          Retail Mutual Funds        598         1,633         (63)                 2,656         3,682         (28)          Closed blocks        20         30         (33)                 62         81         (23)          Total Retail   $    5,004    $    6,133         (18)    %       $    15,531    $    14,285         9    %     Institutional                                                                 Group Retirement   $    1,686    $    1,838         (8)    %       $    5,034    $    5,283         (5)    %     Institutional Markets        2,840         293        NM                3,182         697         357          Group Benefits        132         158         (16)                 404         502         (20)          Total Institutional        4,658         2,289         103                 8,620         6,482         33          Total Life and Retirement premiums and deposits   $    9,662    $    8,422         15    %       $    24,151    $    20,767         16    %    Premiums and deposits increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to continued strong demand for variable and index annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line and a stable value wrap deposit in the Institutional Markets product line. Institutional Markets premiums and deposits for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included a $2.5 billion deposit to the separate accounts of an AIG Life and Retirement subsidiary in connection with a stable value wrap funding agreement. The increase in premiums and deposits from individual variable annuities and the stable value wrap deposit was partially offset by lower Retail Mutual Fund sales in both periods and lower Fixed Annuities sales in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year.     138       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT           TOTAL PREMIUMS AND DEPOSITS by OPERATING SEGMENT (in millions)           Net Flows           Net flows are presented for investment product lines, which include Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement. Net flows from annuities, which are included in the Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines, represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows from mutual funds, which are included in the Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement product lines, represent deposits less withdrawals.  The following table summarizes net flows for investment product lines:        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended             September 30,           September 30,     (in millions)       2014       2013           2014       2013     Net flows                                         Fixed Annuities   $    (733)    $    (104)        $    (1,572)    $    (2,367)      Retirement Income Solutions        1,952         1,638             4,826         3,501      Retail Mutual Funds        (315)         1,119             78         2,108      Group Retirement        (1,061)         (159)             (1,534)         (575)      Total net flows*   $    (157)    $    2,494        $    1,798    $    2,667     * Excludes activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities, which had reserves of approximately $5.4 billion and $6.0 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Quarterly and Year-to-date Net Flows Total net flows from annuities and mutual funds in AIG Life and Retirement’s investment product lines decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, as growth in sales of variable and index annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line was more than offset by lower sales of Retail Mutual Funds and, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, lower sales of Fixed Annuities. Higher surrenders and withdrawals in both the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, primarily in the Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Fund product lines, resulted in slightly negative net flows in the three-month period and a significant decrease in net flows for both periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. A discussion of the significant variances in net flows for each of these product lines follows, including variances in premiums and deposits, a key component of net flows.     139       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      Retail Net Flows Fixed Annuities premiums and deposits and net flows decreased significantly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest rates in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 remained at historic low levels, resulting in low demand for fixed annuity products in the consumer marketplace. By contrast, in August 2013, a sharp increase in market interest rates allowed annuity crediting rates to rise to the highest level in that year, above levels offered in the preceding four quarters, causing fixed annuity industry sales to rise substantially in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, deposits for Fixed Annuities increased compared to the same period in the prior year, due to modest increases in interest rates and steepening of the yield curve in the first half of 2014, compared to sustained lower rates in the first half of 2013. While Fixed Annuities net flows continued to be negative for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, the net flows for the nine-month period remained higher compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the increase in deposits during the first half of 2014, and relatively stable surrender rates. Retirement Income Solutions premiums and deposits and net flows increased significantly in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting a lower surrender rate and a continued high volume of variable and index annuity sales, which have benefitted from product enhancements, expanded distribution and a more favorable competitive environment. Retail Mutual Fund deposits and net flows decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year. These decreases were primarily driven by activity in the Focused Dividend Strategy Fund, which had record sales in the 2013 periods. Although the Focused Dividend Strategy Fund’s performance was below that of similar funds in the first half of 2014, which contributed to lower level of sales and net flows in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, the fund posted strong, competitive performance in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014. Institutional Net Flows Group Retirement net flows decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher group surrender activity, as well as lower premiums and deposits. The increase in surrenders and surrender rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year included an expected large group surrender of approximately $700 million in the three-month period. An additional large group surrender is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2014. The large group market has become increasingly competitive and has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers. This trend of heightened competition is expected to continue as plan sponsors perform reviews of existing retirement plan relationships.

Mortgage Guaranty (or UGC) offers private residential mortgage guaranty insurance, which protects mortgage lenders and investors from loss due to borrower default and loan foreclosure. The coverage we provide – which is called mortgage guaranty insurance, mortgage insurance, or simply “MI” – enables borrowers to purchase a house with a modest down payment by protecting lenders against the increased risk of borrower default related to high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages – those with less than 20 percent equity.  Prior to 2009, UGC also offered default insurance on domestic second-lien mortgages, private student loans and on mortgages issued in various countries outside the United States. In 2008, UGC ceased offering all types of default insurance other than on mortgages in the United States and Hong Kong and placed the other lines of business into runoff. Global Capital Markets consists of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistently with our risk management objectives. Direct Investment Book consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the MIP and certain non‑derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives. Corporate & Other consists primarily of interest expense, consolidation and eliminations, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, certain expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation‑related charges and credits, the results of AIG’s other business operations, net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment, and equity in the earnings of AerCap. Aircraft Leasing consists of ILFC. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the sale of ILFC effective May 14, 2014.     141       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / OTHER OPERATIONS      Other Operations Results         The following table presents AIG’s Other operations results:        Three Months Ended                Nine Months Ended                  September 30,   Percentage           September 30,   Percentage         (in millions)       2014       2013   Change               2014       2013   Change         Other operations pre-tax operating loss:                                                         Mortgage Guaranty   $    135    $    43     214    %       $    421    $    157     168    %     Global Capital Markets        58         29     100                 332         431     (23)          Direct Investment book        314         110     185                 1,067         1,030     4          Corporate & Other:                                                         Interest expense        (310)         (334)     7                 (962)         (1,084)     11          Corporate expenses, net        (280)         (282)     1                 (805)         (796)     (1)          Equity in pre-tax operating earnings of AerCap(a)        196         -    NM                249         -    NM         Fair value earnings on PICC Group shares(b)        (30)         -    NM                (30)         -    NM         Other businesses        122         (142)    NM                125         (238)    NM         Total Corporate & Other operating loss        (302)         (758)     60                 (1,423)         (2,118)     33          Consolidation and eliminations        (1)         1    NM                1         3     (67)          Total Other operations pre-tax operating income (loss)        204         (575)    NM                398         (497)    NM         Legal reserves         (17)         (400)     96                 (546)         (425)     (28)          Legal settlements        155         -    NM                143         48     198          Loss on extinguishment of debt(c)        (742)         (81)    NM                (1,014)         (459)     (121)          Aircraft Leasing        -         (1)    NM                17         60     (72)          Net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses         18         -    NM                2,168         (47)    NM         Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA                                                         related to net realized gains (losses)        -         -    NM                (13)         -    NM         Net realized capital gains (losses)        126         (166)    NM                (69)         (33)     (109)          Total Other Operations pre-tax income (loss)   $    (256)    $    (1,223)     79    %       $    1,084    $    (1,353)    NM   %    (a) Represents our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income, which excludes certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft.

First Lien Quarterly Results First lien  pre-tax  operating  income  in  the  three-month  period  ended  September  30,  2014  increased  compared  to  the  same period in the  prior  year  due  to  improved  underwriting  income  as  a  result  of  decreased  first-lien  claims  and  claims  adjustment expenses  incurred  and  an  increase  in  first  lien  net  premiums  earned.  The  decrease  in first-lien claims  and  claims  adjustment expenses  reflects  $6  million  of  favorable  prior  year  loss  reserve  development  compared  to  unfavorable  prior  year  loss  reserve development of  $34  million  for  the  same  period  in  the  prior  year.  The  first-lien  net  premiums  earned  in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased  by  $33  million largely from  growth  in  the  book  of  business, higher persistency, and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  acceleration  of  premiums  earned  as  the  result  of  the recognition of  a  shorter  expected  coverage  period  on  certain  single  premium  business.  Underwriting expense increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014      144       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / OTHER OPERATIONS      compared to the same period in the prior year due to an impairment charge on certain capitalized technology costs. Driven by the decreased  claims  and claims adjustment  expenses  and  increased  premiums  earned,  UGC’s  first-lien  combined  ratio  improved  to  55.7  in  the  three-month  period  ended  September  30,  2014  from  92.5  in  the  same  period  in  the  prior  year.  Runoff Businesses Quarterly Results Runoff businesses include second lien, student loan and international businesses, all of which were placed in runoff during 2008. The runoff business’ pre-tax operating income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 was $10 million compared to $1 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to favorable prior year loss reserve development. Mortgage Guaranty Year-to-Date Results UGC’s pre-tax operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year due to improved underwriting income. First Lien Year-to-Date Results First-lien pre-tax operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to improved underwriting income as a result of a $182 million decrease in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred reflecting favorable prior year loss reserve development. In addition, first lien pre-tax operating income increased due to a $98 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned largely from growth in the book of business, higher persistency, and, to a lesser extent, the acceleration of premiums earned as the result of the recognition of a shorter expected coverage period on certain single premium business. Underwriting expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year because of increased spending on technology and an impairment charge on certain capitalized technology costs. The decline in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses combined with the increase in earned premiums resulted in an improved combined ratio of 52.5 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to 93.7 in the same period of the prior year. Runoff Businesses Year-to-Date Results The runoff business’ pre-tax operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 was $39 million compared to $38 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in pre-tax operating income is due to a decline in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $30 million and a $10 million reduction in underwriting expenses, mostly offset by a decline in net premiums earned of $37 million and a decline in net investment income of $2 million.  New Insurance Written         The declines in domestic first lien new insurance written from $14.2 billion to $12.6 billion and from $38.6 billion to $31.3 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, were primarily due to the contraction in the mortgage originations market, which began in the second half of 2013. Delinquency Inventory         The delinquency inventory for domestic first lien business declined during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 as a result of cures and paid claims exceeding the number of newly reported delinquencies. Mortgage Guaranty’s first lien delinquency ratio at September 30, 2014 was 4.6 percent compared to 6.4 percent at September 30, 2013. Over the last several quarters, Mortgage Guaranty has experienced a decline in newly reported defaults and an increase in cure rates.     145       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / OTHER OPERATIONS      The following table provides a summary of delinquency activity in Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first lien delinquency inventory:                        Nine Months Ended                          September 30,     (number of policies)                       2014           2013     Number of delinquencies at the beginning of the year                        47,518             62,832      Newly reported                        35,474             42,581      Cures                        (33,260)             (39,752)      Claims paid                        (8,783)             (15,821)      Other                        (1,727)             92      Number of delinquencies at the end of the period                        39,222             49,932     Global Capital Markets Operations         Global Capital Markets Quarterly Results GCM’s pre-tax income and pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior CDS portfolio and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by declines in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities. Unrealized market valuation gains on the CDS portfolio of $75 million and $54 million were recognized in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase resulted primarily from amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio. Net credit valuation adjustment losses of $17 million were recognized in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to net credit valuation adjustment gains of $19 million in the same period in the prior year. The decline resulted primarily from credit valuation gains on uncollateralized derivative assets in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 due to tightening of counterparty credit spreads. Global Capital Markets Year-to-Date Results GCM’s pre-tax income and pre-tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to declines in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities and declines in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior CDS portfolio, partially offset by gains realized upon unwinding certain positions and a decrease in operating expenses. As previously disclosed, a state regulatory agency has requested additional information relating to the unwinding of a position on which we realized gains of $196 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. Net credit valuation adjustment losses of $42 million were recognized in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to net credit valuation adjustment gains of $153 million in the same period in the prior year. The decline resulted primarily from the recognition of credit valuation losses on derivative assets in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 due to higher exposure of uncollateralized derivative assets compared to credit valuation gains on uncollateralized derivative assets in the same period in the prior year due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads. Unrealized market valuation gains on the CDS portfolio of $223 million and $356 million were recognized in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decline resulted primarily from amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio.     146       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / OTHER OPERATIONS      Direct Investment Book Results         The following table presents Direct Investment book results:        Three Months Ended                Nine Months Ended                          September 30,   Percentage           September 30,       Percentage             (in millions)       2014       2013   Change               2014       2013       Change             Pre-tax operating income   $    314    $    110     185    %       $    1,067    $    1,030         4    %         Legal settlements        31         -    NM                31         27         15              Loss on extinguishment of debt        (155)         -    NM                (203)         (4)        NM             Net realized capital gains (losses)        38         (58)    NM                (40)         31        NM             Pre-tax income   $    228    $    52     338    %       $    855    $    1,084         (21)    %        Direct Investment Book Quarterly Results The DIB’s pre‑tax income and pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs, an increase in net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected and lower interest expense on borrowings resulting from redemptions and repurchases of DIB debt in 2014. The increase in pre-tax income was partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt. Fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs was $220 million and $84 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The fair value appreciation on the ABS CDOs was higher in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 driven primarily by improved collateral pricing due to more significant improvements in home price indices and amortization of the underlying collateral. Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $104 million and $39 million were recognized in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase resulted primarily from higher credit valuation gains on assets due to more significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Direct Investment Book Year-to-Date Results The DIB’s pre‑tax income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt. The DIB’s pre‑tax operating income was relatively flat in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Legal Reserves and Legal Settlements         Legal reserve expenses decreased by $383 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of an increase in legal reserve liability in the prior year period. Legal reserve expenses increased by $121 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of an increase in legal reserve liability in the 2014 period. Legal settlements increased by $155 million and $95 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the global resolution of our residential mortgage-related disputes with Bank of America. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt         The increase in the loss on extinguishment of debt in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year was due to ongoing debt management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    Overview         Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Identification, and Measurement in the 2013 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.      149       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights During the Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2014     Sources · AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries(a) During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, AIG Parent received $1.5 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from AIG Property Casualty and $4.3 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement, which included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds.  AIG Parent also received $1.1 billion in tax sharing payments from our insurance businesses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, including $314 million of such payments during the third quarter of 2014. These payments may be subject to adjustment in future periods. · Debt Issuances(b) On July 16, 2014, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.300% Notes due 2019 and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Notes due 2044. · Legal Settlement In July 2014, we received $650 million in cash in connection with the global resolution of our residential mortgage-related disputes with Bank of America. · ILFC Sale On May 14, 2014, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion from the sale of ILFC after taking into account the settlement of intercompany loans. This cash amount is in addition to the 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares we received as consideration from the sale. Uses(c) • Debt Reduction(d) During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, we reduced DIB debt by approximately $5.0 billion through the following: • On January 17, 2014, a redemption of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Notes due 2014; • In January 2014, repurchases of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 8.250% Notes due 2018; • On May 5, 2014, a redemption of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.000% Notes due 2015; • On July 31, 2014, a redemption of $790 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% Notes due 2016; and  • On July 31, 2014, a redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% Notes due 2017, in each case, using cash allocated to the DIB.  On July 14, 2014, we purchased, in cash tender offers, (i) certain junior subordinated debentures issued or guaranteed by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion and (ii) certain senior notes and debentures issued or guaranteed by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of $700 million.  We also made other repayments of approximately $5.4 billion. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $1.4 billion. • Dividend  We paid a cash dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock during each of the first, second and third quarters of 2014. • Repurchase of Common Stock We repurchased approximately 60 million shares of AIG Common Stock during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.4 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, reflect our payment of approximately $1.7 billion in the aggregate under three ASR agreements and the receipt of approximately 27 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 8.8 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in September 2014.        150       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      (a) In October 2014, we received $635 million in additional dividends that had been declared by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities. (b) On October 15, 2014, we issued an additional $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Notes due 2044. (c) On October 22, 2014, we made a cash payment of $960 million, which is being held in escrow pending final approval of the settlement of the Consolidated 2008 Securities Class Action. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (d) On October 27, 2014, we further reduced DIB debt through a redemption of approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 8.250% Notes due 2018 using cash allocated to the DIB. In addition, since September 30, 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of debt, including (i) approximately $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures and (ii) approximately $405 million aggregate principal amount of 5.450% Medium-Term Notes, Series MP, Matched Investment Program Due May 18, 2017, which were part of the DIB and were repaid using cash allocated to the DIB. We paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.1 billion in connection with our redemptions and repurchases of debt since September 30, 2014. Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash         The following table presents selected data from AIG's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:    Nine Months Ended September 30,                             (in millions)               2014*       2013     Sources:                             Net cash provided by operating activities           $    4,357    $    3,948      Net cash provided by changes in restricted cash                 -          1,251      Net cash provided by other investing activities                5,527         5,267      Changes in policyholder contract balances                1,275         -      Issuance of long-term debt                5,827         3,633      Total sources                16,986         14,099      Uses:                              Change in restricted cash                (660)         -      Change in policyholder contract balances                -         (1,133)      Repayments of long-term debt                (11,561)         (11,355)      Purchases of AIG Common Stock                (3,403)         (192)      Net cash used in other financing activities                (1,739)         (425)      Total uses                (17,363)         (13,105)      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash                (19)         (79)      Increase (decrease) in cash           $    (396)    $    915     * For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, cash decreased by $162 million due to reclassification of $289 million to restricted cash presented in Other assets, partially offset by $127 million reclassification from Short-term investments, to correct prior period presentation.     151       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      The following table presents a summary of AIG’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:    Nine Months Ended September 30,                                 (in millions)                   2014       2013     Summary:                                  Net cash provided by operating activities               $    4,357    $    3,948       Net cash provided by investing activities                    4,867         6,518       Net cash used in financing activities                    (9,601)         (9,472)       Effect of exchange rate changes on cash                    (19)         (79)      Increase (decrease) in cash                    (396)         915      Cash at beginning of year                    2,241         1,151      Change in cash of businesses held-for-sale                    88         (8)      Cash at end of period               $    1,933    $    2,058     Operating Cash Flow Activities         Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.  Interest payments totaled $2.6 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $3.0 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013. Cash provided by operating activities excluding interest payments was $7.0 billion for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 compared to $6.9 billion in the first nine months of 2013. Operating cash flow activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 include: • $1.2 billion of cash provided by AIG Property Casualty in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to $0.1 billion of cash used during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 primarily due to the timing of the payments related to catastrophe losses in 2013; and • $2.6 billion of cash provided by AIG Life and Retirement in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to cash provided of $2.1 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, which reflected the continued profitability of AIG Life and Retirement and included higher legal settlement proceeds in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Investing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 includes: • approximately $1.0 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement; and • approximately $2.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ILFC. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 included approximately $1.1 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement. Financing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 includes:     152       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      • approximately $539 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2014; • approximately $3.4 billion to repurchase approximately 60 million shares of AIG Common Stock;  • approximately $271 million to repay long-term debt of business held-for-sale; and • approximately $11.3 billion to repay long-term debt; see Debt – Debt Maturities below. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 includes: • approximately $147 million to pay a dividend of $0.10 per share on AIG Common Stock in the third quarter of 2013;  • approximately $192 million to purchase approximately four million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $7.4 billion to repay long-term debt; see Debt – Debt Maturities below. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries         AIG Parent         As of September 30, 2014, AIG Parent had approximately $17.1 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity sources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. We generally manage capital flows between AIG Parent and its subsidiaries through internal, Board‑approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. See AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty below for additional details regarding the CMAs. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our core insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital generated by our core insurance operations through earnings or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that capital associated with businesses or investments that do not directly support our core insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.  In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the capital resources available to support our core insurance operations and business strategies, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in      153       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      comparison to internal benchmarks, expectations for capital generation, rating agency expectations for capital, as well as regulatory standards for capital and capital distributions. The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   September 30, 2014   December 31, 2013     Cash and short-term investments(a)(b)   $    8,717    $    10,154      Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(c)        3,892         2,968      Total AIG Parent liquidity        12,609         13,122      Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(d)        4,000         3,947      Available capacity under contingent liquidity facility(e)        500         500      Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $    17,109    $    17,569     (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $6.2 billion and $6.9 billion as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  (b) $2.7 billion and $5.9 billion of cash and short-term investments as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, are allocated toward future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs of DIB and GCM. (c) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. (d) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see Credit Facilities below. (e) For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facility, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below. AIG Property Casualty         We expect that AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries’ liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Certain AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs may be used to supplement liquidity. As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, no AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries had FHLB borrowings outstanding.  AIG Property Casualty’s subsidiaries may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require AIG to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of AIG’s subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. AIG Parent and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL), an AIG Property Casualty subsidiary, are parties to a $625 million letter of credit facility. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd’s of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd’s), is required to hold capital at Lloyd’s, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the facility, which supports the 2014 and 2015 years of account, the entire FAL capital requirement of $600 million, as of September 30, 2014, was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and AIG Property Casualty domestic insurance subsidiaries through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent, AIG Property Casualty Inc. and certain AIG Property Casualty domestic insurance subsidiaries are parties to a consolidated CMA. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries, measured as a group (the Fleet), at or above the specified minimum percentage of the Fleet’s projected total authorized control level Risk‑Based Capital (RBC). As of September 30, 2014, the specified minimum percentage in the CMA was 300 percent.     154       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, AIG Property Casualty paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. In addition, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, AIG Property Casualty paid other non-cash dividends of $178 million to AIG Parent. AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions pursuant to the CMA. AIG Life and Retirement         We expect that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries’ liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. AIG Life and Retirement had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of $44 million as of September 30, 2014 and $50 million as of December 31, 2013.  The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a potential liquidity requirement for AIG Life and Retirement’s insurance subsidiaries. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of its investment portfolios, AIG Life and Retirement does not face a significant liquidity risk due to normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience. Furthermore, AIG Life and Retirement’s products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of its risk management framework, AIG Life and Retirement continues to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve its liquidity position and facilitate AIG Life and Retirement’s ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. AIG Life and Retirement also has developed a contingent liquidity plan to address unforeseen liquidity needs.  AIG Life and Retirement executes programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from its investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that an AIG Life and Retirement insurance company may lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. AIG Life and Retirement’s liability to borrowers for collateral received was $3.0 billion as of September 30, 2014 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2013.  AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent was party to CMAs with certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries. Among other things, the CMAs provided that AIG Parent would maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary’s projected NAIC Company Action Level RBC. As of September 30, 2014, the specified minimum percentage in the CMAs was 385 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage was 250 percent. As a result of managing capital through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines, the parties agreed to terminate these CMAs effective October 31, 2014, with the exception of the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, which remains in place.  Dividends and loan repayments paid by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries to AIG Parent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 totaled $4.9 billion, which was comprised of $4.3 billion of cash and $642 million of preferred equity interests in two aircraft trust entities, and included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement distributed $635 million of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent in October 2014, which represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign      155       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      bonds, as well as agency RMBS.  AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the CMAs then in place. Other Operations         Mortgage Guaranty         We expect that Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Mortgage Guaranty's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated, fixed maturity securities. These securities could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.  AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and Mortgage Guarantee insurance subsidiaries through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with a Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to its board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of September 30, 2014, the minimum required capital is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 19 to 1. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, Mortgage Guaranty paid no dividends to AIG Parent, and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the CMA. Global Capital Markets         Derivative transactions between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through GCM, specifically through the entity AIG Markets. GCM is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). To the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation, GCM is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and GCM’s clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants. To the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation, these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements, the form of which is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA). Many of these agreements, primarily between GCM and third party financial institutions, require collateral postings. Many of GCM’s transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements, the purpose of which are to provide collateral to GCM, which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties, including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants.  In addition, most of GCM’s CDSs within AIGFP are subject to collateral posting provisions. The collateral posting provisions contained in the ISDA Master Agreements and related transaction documents with respect to CDSs differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior CDSs is a function of our credit ratings, the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with market value being the most significant factor. We estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDSs using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions.      156       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, GCM had total assets of $5.9 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, and total liabilities of $3.1 billion as of both dates. GCM’s assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM’s liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted by GCM to third parties was $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. GCM obtained collateral from third parties totaling $705 million and $572 million at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under ISDA Master Agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date. Direct Investment Book         The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives. We are focused on meeting the DIB’s liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB, without relying on resources beyond the DIB. As part of this program management, we may from time to time access the capital markets, including issuing and repurchasing debt, and selling assets on an opportunistic basis, in each case subject to market conditions. If the DIB’s risk target is breached, we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB’s liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then‑prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. From time to time, we may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target for the DIB for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB. The DIB’s assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, U.S. government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities. The DIB’s liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short-term financing obligations. As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the DIB had total assets of $17.1 billion and $23.3 billion, respectively, and total liabilities of $12.5 billion and $20.0 billion, respectively.  The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets, liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB’s assets, liabilities or operating results. Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $3.5 billion at September 30, 2014 and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2013. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Credit Facilities         We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Five-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Five-Year Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.0 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2019. As of September 30, 2014, a total of $4.0 billion remains available under the Five-Year Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Five-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our      157       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Five-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Contingent Liquidity Facilities         AIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.  Our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.

In addition, since September 30, 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of debt, including (i) approximately $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures and (ii) approximately $405 million aggregate principal amount of 5.450% Medium-Term Notes, Series MP, Matched Investment Program Due May 18, 2017, which were part of the DIB and were repaid using cash allocated to the DIB. Accordingly, in the table above, these instruments are reported as maturing in the remainder of 2014 instead of their original maturity dates. (b) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (c) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.5 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.  Loss Reserves         Loss reserves relate to the AIG Property Casualty and the Mortgage Guaranty businesses and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments.      158       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      We believe that AIG Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities         Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to AIG Life and Retirement businesses. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.  Borrowings         Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements.

Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2014 is expected to be approximately $14 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (f) Includes a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility). The AerCap Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and permits loans for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities          We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     160       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Indemnification Agreements         We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

Credit Ratings         Credit ratings estimate a company’s ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing to that company. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of October 30, 2014. Figures in parentheses indicate the relative ranking of the ratings within the agency’s rating categories; that ranking refers only to the major rating category and not to the modifiers assigned by the rating agencies.

They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other GCM entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other GCM entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other GCM entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early. The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity, Capital and Credit in the 2013 Annual Report.  Regulation and Supervision         For a discussion of our regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, including with respect to our liquidity and capital resources, see Part I, Item 1.

MD&A – Regulatory Environment in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock     On February 13, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on March 25, 2014 to shareholders of record on March 11, 2014. On May 5, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on June 24, 2014 to shareholders of record on June 10, 2014. On August 4, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on September 25, 2014 to shareholders of record on September 11, 2014. On November 3, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on December 18, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2014. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2013 Annual Report. On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. On February 13, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $1.0 billion. On June 5, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $2.0 billion.     164       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased approximately 60 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.4 billion pursuant to this authorization.  On October 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $1.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization of approximately $1.5 billion. In the second and third quarters of 2014, we executed three ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, each as set forth above, reflect our payment of approximately $1.7 billion in the aggregate to the financial institutions under the ASR agreements and the receipt of approximately 27 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 8.8 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in September 2014. That ASR agreement settled in October, at which time we received approximately 3.9 million additional shares of AIG Common Stock based on a formula specified by the terms of the ASR agreement. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.  Dividend Restrictions         Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2013 Annual Report for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG’s subsidiaries.      INVESTMENTS    Overview         Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement, and AIG Parent including the DIB. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.    Investments Highlights During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014     · A decrease in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities and narrowing of investment grade credit spreads, partially offset by the widening of high yield spreads, resulted in net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $18.1 billion as of September 30, 2014 from approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2013. · We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. · Net investment income benefitted from positive performance on fixed maturity securities for which we elected the fair value option, primarily driven by lower interest rates as well as higher income on alternative investments, which continued to benefit from strong equity market performance. · Blended investment yields on new AIG Life and Retirement and AIG Property Casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  · Other-than-temporary impairments remained at low levels, with a small portion of impairments attributable to structured securities. · The sale of ILFC to AerCap resulted in AIG receiving a 46 percent ownership interest in the outstanding common stock of AerCap, which is included in Other invested assets and accounted for under the equity method.         165       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS        Investment Strategies         Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: · While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability matching in AIG Life and Retirement, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable. · Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty consist of a mix of tax-exempt municipal bonds and taxable instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. · Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  · AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate term investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate term, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. Credit Ratings         At September 30, 2014, approximately 90 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. A significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody’s, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2014, approximately 16 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 4 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 45 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.     166       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      Composite AIG Credit Ratings         With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.

AIG Property Casualty         For AIG Property Casualty, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investments within AIG Property Casualty focus on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. AIG Property Casualty invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invests in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, AIG Property Casualty seeks to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds and hedge funds. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. AIG Property Casualty’s investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, common and preferred stocks and yield-enhancement items, such as other securities for which the fair value option has been elected.     168       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      With respect to non-affiliate over‑the‑counter derivatives, AIG Property Casualty conducts business with highly rated counterparties and does not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. AIG Property Casualty has controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. AIG Property Casualty generally uses ISDA Master Agreements and CSAs with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures. Fixed maturity investments of AIG Property Casualty’s domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.1 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity investments held in AIG Property Casualty’s foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and short to intermediate duration, averaging 4.5 years. While invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in AIG Property Casualty’s domestic operations, a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds. These investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long-term returns over time. AIG Life and Retirement         The investment strategy of AIG Life and Retirement is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability matching and available investment opportunities. AIG Life and Retirement uses asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in our businesses. AIG Life and Retirement’s fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to largely match the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. AIG Life and Retirement invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement seeks to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds, and affordable housing partnerships. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. AIG Life and Retirement’s investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, common and preferred stocks and yield-enhancement items, such as other securities for which the fair value option has been elected. AIG Life and Retirement monitors fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. AIG Life and Retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.     169       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      Certain AIG Life and Retirement variable and index annuity products offer guaranteed living benefit features, primarily guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits. AIG Life and Retirement has a dynamic economic hedging program designed to manage its risk exposure under such guaranteed living benefit features from changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatilities. This program utilizes derivative instruments, including equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap contracts, as well as U.S. Treasury bonds. With respect to over‑the‑counter derivatives, AIG Life and Retirement deals with highly rated counterparties and does not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. AIG Life and Retirement has controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. AIG Life and Retirement generally uses ISDA Master Agreements and CSAs with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities for which we have changed our intent from hold to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements.     181       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      There was no significant impact to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations from other-than-temporary impairment charges for any one single credit. Also, no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.01 percent and 0.02 percent of total equity at either September 30, 2014 or September 30, 2013, respectively. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $183 million and $184 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $544 million and $611 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 respectively.

Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments          The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the third quarter of 2014 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities due to the widening of credit spreads. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $6.5 billion due to a      182       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      decrease in interest rates on fixed maturity securities and narrowing of investment grade credit spreads, partially offset by widening of high yield spreads. The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the third quarter of 2013 was primarily attributable to the depreciation in the fair value of bonds available for sale due to the increase in interest rates, which more than offset the narrowing of credit spreads. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $12.8 billion.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT    Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview         We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful, and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2013 Annual Report.  Credit Risk Management         Overview         Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require      183       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We identify our aggregate credit exposures to our underlying counterparty risks and report them regularly to senior management for review. See Investments – Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures. Market Risk Management         Overview         Market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currencies, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets businesses. The chief risk officer within each such business is responsible for properly identifying these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the written risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Risk Identification         Market risk quantifies the adverse impact on us due to broad, systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: Equity market prices. We are exposed to equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. These include direct investments in publicly‑traded shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange‑traded funds and other equity‑linked capital market instruments as well as other equity‑linked insurance products, including but not limited to equity‑indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance, and variable universal life insurance. Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Residential investments include residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential mortgages: trusts that include real estate and/or mortgages (REITs), and mortgage insurance contracts. Commercial exposures include commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include commercial mortgages: trusts, REITs, and other investments. Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Low interest rates mean less investment income and potentially less attractive insurance products. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Credit spread or risk premium. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the long‑term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing securities, which is      184       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit‑worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses. Foreign currency exchange rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Commodity Prices. Changes in the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives. Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including debt securities linked to inflation index returns, derivatives on inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels in our primary casualty business. Risk Measurement         Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity we have available within our framework. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specified stress tests. In addition, we continue to develop economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.    We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:     Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in price on equity securities. Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets. Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.        185       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Market Risk Sensitivities         The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:        Balance Sheet Exposure               Balance Sheet Effect         September 30,       December 31,               September 30,       December 31,      (dollars in millions)       2014           2013                   2014           2013     Sensitivity factor                                    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves     Interest rate sensitive assets:                                                         Fixed maturity securities        280,853             268,208                     (15,292)             (14,341)      Mortgage and other loans receivable        16,225             14,649                     (833)             (661)      Preferred stock        22             21                     (3)             (2)      Total interest rate sensitive assets   $    297,100    (a)   $    282,878    (a)            $    (16,128)    (b)    $    (15,004)      Sensitivity factor                                    20% decline in stock prices and value of                                         alternative investments     Equity and alternative investments exposure:                                                         Hedge funds        10,530             9,900                     (2,106)             (1,980)      Private equity        9,345             9,810                     (1,869)             (1,962)      Real estate investments        3,327             3,113                     (665)             (623)      PICC(c)         2,841             2,536                     (568)             (507)      Common equity        2,241             1,927                     (448)             (385)      Aircraft asset investments        673             763                     (135)             (153)      AerCap Holdings N.V.        4,820             -                     (964)             -      Other investments        924             957                     (185)             (191)      Total equity and alternative investments                                                          exposure   $    34,701        $    29,006                $    (6,940)        $    (5,801)      Sensitivity factor                                    10% depreciation of all foreign currency                                          exchange rates against the U.S. dollar     Foreign currency-denominated net                                                          asset position(d)   $    11,155        $    10,350                $    (1,116)        $    (1,035)     (a) At September 30, 2014, the analysis covered $297 billion of $314 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $1 billion in DIB assets, $7 billion of loans, and $4 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2013, the analysis covered $283 billion of $306 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $6 billion in DIB assets, $5 billion of loans, and $4 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling and/or data limitations.  (b) Commencing in the first quarter of 2014, we began using a duration and convexity method to estimate the impact of a 100 bps increase in interest rates on each security. The change in method resulted in no material effect on the amounts presented at December 31, 2013. (c) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C. (d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries. However, we may utilize either cross-currency swaps or our foreign currency- denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries.  At September 30, 2014, our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in British pounds, Canadian dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen and Singapore dollars. Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at September 30, 2014 increased by 7.8 percent, or $805 million, compared to December 31, 2013. The increase was mostly due to a $422 million increase in our British pound position, primarily resulting from the purchase of British pounds using excess      186       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      euros to fund outflows; a $326 million increase in our Japanese yen position, mainly attributable to Japanese yen deferred tax liability reduction; a $228 million increase in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from AIG Property Casualty’s investment in PICC P&C; a $159 million increase in our Canadian dollar position, mainly attributable to an increase in operating income from underwriting and investments; and a $144 million increase in our Singapore dollar position, primarily due to intercompany receivables generated from declared dividends in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by a $374 million decrease in our euro position, primarily resulting from bond hedging and the sale of excess euros to fund British pound outflows; and a $172 million decrease in our Polish zloty position, primarily resulting from the sale of our equity investment in Santander Consumer Bank.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management         Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. The failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, and reputational harm. Because liquidity is critically important, our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events. Sources of Liquidity risk can include, but are not limited to: · financial market movements — significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies. Changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions, inadequate market depth, or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets; · potential reputational events or credit downgrade — changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements; and · catastrophic events, including natural and man‑made disasters, that can increase policyholder claims. The principal objective of our liquidity risk framework is to protect our liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods. This framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period greater than one year. We maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements. We strive to manage our liquidity prudently at a legal entity level across AIG Parent and the operating companies. Key components of the framework include effective corporate governance and policy, maintaining diversified sources of liquidity, contingency funding plans, and regular review of liquidity metrics in both normal and stress conditions. We view each component of the framework together to achieve our goal of sound liquidity risk management.      187       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES          CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:     • income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset; • liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense; • reinsurance assets; • valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; • valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; • estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; • impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on investments in life settlements and goodwill impairment; • liability for legal contingencies; and • fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, you should read Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2013 Annual Report.      REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT    Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. AIG continues to be regulated and supervised by the FRB due to its designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a nonbank SIFI, but is no longer regulated as a savings and loan holding company due to the restructuring of AIG Federal Savings Bank from a federal savings association to a trust-only thrift. On July 1, 2014, as a nonbank SIFI, AIG submitted to its regulators its initial annual plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which must meet several specific standards, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. The public section of the plan can be found on the websites of the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FRB has yet to complete the regulatory framework that will be applicable to AIG as a nonbank SIFI.     188       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT      In October 2014, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) announced that it has concluded the development of its proposed basic capital requirements, which are expected to be endorsed by G20 leaders in November 2014. Other related IAIS initiatives are pending. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2013 Annual Report.     189       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY           GLOSSARY      Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of value of business acquired (VOBA) and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC). Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting, and the change in DAC. Acquisition costs that are incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are deferred and recognized over the coverage periods of related insurance contracts. Acquisition costs that are not incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are recognized as incurred.  Additional premium/Return premium is a premium due either to or from an insured as a result of a change in coverage (e.g. increase or decrease in limits or risk) or cancellation of an existing policy. In addition, certain policies provide for adjustments to the original premium amount charged based on the experience of the policy, e.g. workers’ compensation policies and loss sensitive policies where changes to the original premium are based on variances of the loss history against estimates built into the determination of the original premium. AIG – After-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG: income (loss) from discontinued operations, income (loss) from divested businesses (including gain on the sale of ILFC and certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and related tax effects), legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments, legal reserves (settlements) related to “legacy crisis matters,” deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges, changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains (losses), AIG Property Casualty other (income) expense - net,  (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, and non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses. “Legacy crisis matters” include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters. AIG Life and Retirement – Pre-tax  operating income (loss) Pre-tax operating income (loss) is derived by excluding the following items from pre-tax income (loss): legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters, changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), net realized capital (gains) losses, and changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses).  AIG Life and Retirement – Premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds. AIG Life and Retirement – Surrender rate represents annualized surrenders and withdrawals as a percentage of average account value. AIG Property Casualty – Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as Unearned premium reserves in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.     190       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      AIG Property Casualty – Pre-tax  operating income (loss) includes both underwriting income (loss) and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital (gains) losses, other (income) expense - net, and legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters. Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses. BET Binomial Expansion Technique A model that generates expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derives a credit rating for those tranches. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) (AOCI) is a non-GAAP measure and is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $10 million each. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document that provides for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels. CVA  Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in the DIB’s asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk, in the fair value measurement of all net derivative liabilities positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments An adjustment to DAC for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (also referred to as “shadow DAC”). The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. First-Lien Priority over all other liens or claims on a property in the event of default on a mortgage.  General operating expense ratio general operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude claims adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses. GIC/GIA Guaranteed Investment Contract/Guaranteed Investment Agreement A contract whereby the seller provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. G-SII Global Systemically Important Insurer An insurer that is deemed globally systemically important (that is, of such size, market importance and global interconnectedness that the distress or failure of the insurer would cause significant dislocation in the global financial system and adverse economic consequences across a range of countries) by the Financial Stability Board, in consultation with and based on a methodology developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.     191       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      High loss deductible policies  A type of commercial insurance policy where we pay the full claim and then seek reimbursement from the insured for the deductible. Losses are retained by the insured up to a specified deductible amount (usually $25,000 or more per claim, subject to individual state approval) and we insure the claims in excess of the deductible. Generally, the total claims (including the deductible portion) are managed and paid by us as part of a loss control program, and we are reimbursed the deductible amount by the insured. In the case of unpaid claims, we make estimates of the deductible portion of claims reported to us, and reduce our loss reserves accordingly. In most cases, we obtain collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other funding arrangements to secure the amounts of uncollected deductibles. IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. Loss Ratio Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. Claims adjustment expenses are directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees, and claims department personnel costs. Loss Recognition Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments An adjustment to DAC and future policy benefits for long-duration traditional products, equal to the adjustments that would be required if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields, and such reinvestment would not be sufficient to recover DAC and meet policyholder obligations (also referred to as “shadow loss recognition”). The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Other comprehensive income (loss). Loss reserve development The increase or decrease in incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claims adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. LTV Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one contract. Net premiums written Represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as Unearned premium reserves in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. Other Operations – Pre-tax operating income (loss): pre-tax income (loss) excluding certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, Net realized capital (gains) losses, net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses (including gain on the sale of ILFC and certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and our share of AerCap’s income taxes), changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) and income (loss) from divested businesses, including Aircraft Leasing.  Policy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses. Pool  A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage. Our members in the admitted lines pool are licensed to write standard lines of business by the individual state departments of insurance, and the policy forms and rates are regulated by those departments. Our members in the surplus lines pool provide policyholders with insurance coverage for risks which are generally not available in the standard insurance market. Surplus lines policy forms and rates are not regulated by the insurance departments.     192       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      Prior year development Increase or decrease in estimates of losses and loss expenses for prior years that is included in earnings. RBC Risk-Based Capital  A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. Reinstatement premium Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. Rescission Denial of claims and termination of coverage on loans related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms. Retained Interest Category within AIG’s Other Operations that includes the fair value gains or losses, prior to their sale, of the AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA Group Limited initial public offering and the MetLife, Inc. securities that were received as consideration from the sale of American Life Insurance Company and the fair value gains or losses, prior to the FRBNY liquidation of Maiden Lane III LLC assets in 2012, on the retained interest in Maiden Lane III LLC. Retroactive Reinsurance See Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance. Salvage  The amount that can be recovered by us for the sale of damaged goods for which our policyholder has been indemnified (and to which title was transferred to us). Second-lien Subordinate in ranking to the first-lien holder claims on a property in the event of default on a mortgage. Severe losses Individual non-catastrophe first party losses and surety losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance and salvage and subrogation. Severe losses include claims related to satellite explosions, plane crashes, and shipwrecks. SIA Sales Inducement Asset Represents amounts that are credited to policyholder account balances related to the enhanced crediting rates that a seller offers on certain of its annuity products. SIFI Systemically Important Financial Institutions Financial institutions are deemed systemically important (that is, the failure of the financial institution could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) based on a three-stage analytical process. Solvency II  Legislation in the European Union which reforms the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC), was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective in January 2016. SSDMF Social Security Death Master File A database of deceased individuals, most of whom were issued a social security number during their lifetimes, maintained by the U.S. Social Security Administration. Subrogation The amount of recovery for claims we have paid our policyholders, generally from a negligent third party or such party’s insurer.

Item 4. / Controls and Procedures         Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2014. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.      195     TABLE OF CONTENTS           PART II – OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1 / Legal Proceedings         For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

On February 13, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $1.0 billion. On June 5, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $2.0 billion. On October 31, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the August 1, 2013 repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $1.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization of approximately $1.5 billion. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, we repurchased approximately 24.8 million shares of AIG Common Stock under this authorization for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of those shares, each as set forth above, reflect our payment of $1.4 billion under two ASR agreements executed in the third quarter of 2014 and the receipt of approximately 21.6 million shares of AIG Common Stock, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 8.8 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR agreement executed in September 2014. That ASR agreement settled in October 2014, at which time we received approximately 3.9 million additional shares of AIG Common Stock based on a formula specified by the terms of the ASR Agreement. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 also includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 1.7 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in July 2014 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the second quarter of 2014.
