AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     77                Table of Contents    The MD&A is organized as follows:    INDEX TO ITEM 2                       Page       USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES   79       EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    80       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    90       Segment Results   92    AIG Property Casualty Operations   97    Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense   113    AIG Life and Retirement Operations   118    Other Operations   130    Discontinued Operations   137    Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)   137    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    139       Overview   139    Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash   141    Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries   142    Credit Facilities   147    Contingent Liquidity Facilities   148    Contractual Obligations   148    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   150    Debt   151    Credit Ratings   153    Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock   154    INVESTMENTS    155       Market Conditions   155    Investment Strategies   155    Investment Highlights   156    Impairments   166    ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT    171       Overview   171    Credit Risk Management   171    Market Risk Management   176    Liquidity Risk Management   178    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    179       REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT    183       GLOSSARY    185       ACRONYMS    188            78                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES       Use of Non-GAAP Measures  Throughout this MD&A, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, representative and most transparent. Some of the measurements we use are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for "accounting principles generally accepted in the United States." The non-GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.    Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (AOCI) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented below in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A.  We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG and our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A.   •  AIG — After-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses, income from divested businesses, legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments, legal reserves (settlements) related to "legacy crisis matters," deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges, changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital (gains) losses, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses, and bargain purchase gain. "Legacy crisis matters" include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.  •  AIG Property Casualty    •  Operating income (loss): includes both underwriting income (loss) and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital (gains) losses, other (income) expense, legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above and bargain purchase gain. Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expense, acquisition expense and general operating expense.   •  Ratios: AIG Property Casualty, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.     •  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted: the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $10 million each.        79      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      •  Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted: the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.       •  AIG Life and Retirement    •  Operating income (loss): is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss): legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above, changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), net realized capital (gains) losses, and changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital (gains) losses. We believe that Operating income (loss) is useful because excluding these volatile items permits investors to better assess the operating performance of the underlying business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations.   •  Premiums and deposits: includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) and mutual funds.    •  Other Operations — Operating income (loss): income (loss) excluding certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters described above, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, Net realized capital (gains) losses, net (gains) losses on sale of divested businesses and properties, and income from divested businesses.  Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.   Executive Overview  This overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2012 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.

See Segment Results — AIG Life and Retirement Operations for additional information.  •  Other Operations — AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets (GCM) operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), Direct Investment book (including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP), Retained Interests and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).     80                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW       Executive Summary  We continued our positive financial and operational performance in 2013:  •  AIG Property Casualty reported operating income in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 of $1.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, compared to $936 million and $2.0 billion in the same periods in the prior year. Underwriting performance improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, as evidenced by the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, which declined to 96.5 and 97.0, respectively, compared to 98.3 and 99.3 in the same periods in the prior year. Net investment income in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 also benefited from the strong performance of alternative investments and gains on fair value option securities.  •  AIG Life and Retirement reported growth in assets under management since December 31, 2012 from robust sales of variable annuities and retail mutual funds and appreciation due to higher equity markets. Operating income improved from effective spread management, higher net investment income and growth in fee income.  •  Mortgage Guaranty reported a 63 percent increase in new insurance written in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 and has experienced improving market conditions including increasing home values.   •  Our investment portfolio performance, excluding gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investments in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) and AIA Group Limited (AIA), improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 through yield enhancement initiatives, including the reduction of our concentration in lower-yielding tax-exempt municipal securities and the purchase of higher-yielding securities. The investment portfolio performance also improved due to an increase in alternative investment income primarily as a result of favorable equity market performance in the six months ended June 30, 2013.  •  Realized capital gains improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 because certain assets in unrealized gain positions were sold as part of a program to utilize capital loss carryforwards.   •  We reduced our debt in the first half of 2013 as a result of maturities, repayments and purchases of $5.6 billion of debt, including:      •the redemption of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures and the redemption of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.45% Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures and;   •our purchase, in cash tender offers, of an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.0 billion, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion, of our junior subordinated debentures, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIG Life Holdings, Inc. (AIGLH) and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.   •we also made other repayments of approximately $2.7 billion.      As a result of the redemptions and cash tender offers, we expect annual interest expense to decrease by approximately $213 million.     •  We maintained financial flexibility in the first half of 2013 through $792 million in cash dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and $1.9 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.   •  On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.10 per share, payable on September 26, 2013 to shareholders of record on September 12, 2013.  •  On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise.     81      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Our Performance — Selected Indicators                                                            Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,       (in millions, except per share data and ratios)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Results of operations data:                                     Total revenues        $   17,315    $ 16,221        $   33,203    $ 33,718      Income from continuing operations           2,725      2,160           4,863      5,545      Net income attributable to AIG           2,731      2,332           4,937      5,540      Net income per common share attributable to AIG (diluted)           1.84      1.33           3.33      3.05      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG           1,655      1,678           3,637      4,724          Key metrics:                                     AIG Property Casualty combined ratio           102.6      102.4           100.0      102.3      AIG Property Casualty accident year combined ratio, as adjusted           96.5      98.3           97.0      99.3      AIG Life and Retirement premiums and deposits        $   6,765    $ 5,434        $   12,345    $ 10,994      AIG Life and Retirement assets under management                           293,665      267,754      Mortgage Guaranty new insurance written           13,979      8,576           24,637      15,139                                                  (in millions, except per share data)     June 30, 2013     December 31, 2012            Balance sheet data:                      Total assets        $   537,438    $ 548,633      Long-term debt           42,614      48,500      Total AIG shareholders' equity           97,463      98,002      Book value per common share           66.02      66.38      Book value per common share excluding AOCI           61.25      57.87           The following table presents a reconciliation of Book value per common share to Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a non-GAAP measure.

These changes did not affect Income from continuing operations before income tax expense or Net income attributable to AIG. Also, the presentation of the operating segments within the AIG Life and Retirement segment was revised in the first quarter of 2013 to reflect two new operating segments: Retail and Institutional. For further discussion, see Notes 1 and 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.       Investment Highlights  Net investment income decreased 31 percent to $8.0 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period of 2012, primarily due to fair value gains in 2012 on our investments in ML II, ML III and AIA, which were liquidated during 2012. The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was largely unchanged.   •Our insurance operations achieved a $407 million increase in net investment income due to higher alternative investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Net investment income improved due to higher alternative investment income, driven primarily by equity market gains, which was partially offset by the absence of ML II gains in the first half of 2013 compared to 2012. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with attractive and appropriate risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.     84      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW   •Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio declined to approximately $14 billion as of June 30, 2013 from approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2012 due to increases in interest rates and the realization of over $1.5 billion in gains.   •Other-than-temporary impairments were significantly lower during the first six months of 2013 than the prior year, in part driven by favorable developments in the housing sector that led to strong performance in our structured products portfolios.       Strategic Outlook      Industry Trends     Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2013, characterized by factors such as low interest rates, instability in the global markets due to the European debt crisis and slow growth in the U.S. economy.  Low interest rates in the U.S. fixed income market relative to historic levels have significantly affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines.       AIG Priorities for 2013   AIG remains focused on the following priorities for 2013:  •Strengthen and improve the operating performance of our core businesses;   •Consummate the sale of up to 90 percent of our interest in ILFC;  •Enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality;   •Manage our capital and interest expense more efficiently by improving our capital structure and redeploying excess capital in areas that promote profitable growth;  •Work with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in its capacity as our principal regulator; and   •Reduce operating expenses by leveraging our scale and driving increased standardization through investments in infrastructure.        Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2013 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2012 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.      AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY OUTLOOK     We expect that the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets through at least the end of 2013. Due to these conditions, coupled with overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, we have sought to tighten terms and conditions, shed unprofitable business and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability.     85      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  We have observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. Commencing in the second quarter of 2011, and continuing since, we have benefitted from favorable pricing trends, particularly in our U.S. commercial business. The property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in some markets. We expect that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions.  As part of our strategy to expand our consumer operations in emerging markets, on May 29, 2013, we entered into a joint venture agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company Limited (PICC Life), a subsidiary of The People's Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group), to form an agency distribution company in China. Products under consideration to be distributed by the joint venture company include jointly developed life and retirement insurance products, existing PICC Life products, PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) insurance products, AIG Property Casualty products, as well as other products aimed at meeting the needs of this developing market. We will own 24.9 percent of the joint venture company with PICC Life holding the remaining 75.1 percent. Our participation in the joint venture will be managed by AIG Property Casualty. The joint venture is planned to commence operations by the first quarter of 2014 subject to regulatory approval.  On June 6, 2013, we also exercised rights to purchase shares in connection with the rights offering of PICC P&C, a subsidiary of the PICC Group, for a purchase price of approximately $93 million. Immediately prior to and after the rights offering, we owned 9.9 percent of the outstanding shares in PICC P&C.     AIG Property Casualty Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities   •   Business Mix Shift   •Continue shifting toward higher value business to increase profitability.  •Expand in attractive growth economies, specifically in Asia Pacific, Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.   •   Underwriting Excellence – Enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate to the risk assumed.   •  Claims Best Practices – Implement improved claims practices and advanced technology to lower the loss ratio.   •   Operating Expense Discipline – Apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of our global footprint.   •  Capital Efficiency – Continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency.  •   Investment Strategy – Continue to execute our investment strategy, which includes increased asset diversification and yield-enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity, risk and return objectives.     Capital Efficiency     We continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for our operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing our global reinsurance strategy to improve capital efficiency.  We continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. In the six months ended June 30, 2013, we completed 19 legal entity and branch restructuring transactions. We continue to implement restructuring plans in various jurisdictions. Our overall legal entity restructuring is expected to be mostly completed by the end of 2014, subject to regulatory approvals in those jurisdictions.     86      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  On July 16, 2013, we announced the planned merger of AIU Insurance Company Ltd. (AIU) and Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Company, Ltd. (FFM), scheduled to take place in the second half of 2015 or later, subject to regulatory approvals. The merger is consistent with our growth strategy for the Japan market, and is intended to combine the expertise and experience of these companies to meet our customers' and partners' needs and provide products and services which will target higher levels of customer satisfaction in a cost-effective manner.  We continued the strategy, adopted in 2010, to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. On July 9, 2013, we entered into a five-year catastrophe bond transaction, which will provide $125 million of indemnity protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. The transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through June 2018. In addition, effective May 31, 2013, we modified certain reinsurance arrangements from our Japan entities to simplify operations and facilitate efficient capital allocation.      AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT OUTLOOK     AIG Life and Retirement's businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets. Continued low interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing products. Products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate-adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields fall to a level that results in expected future losses. Also, low interest rates can affect the recoverability and accelerate the amortization of DAC assets held with respect to our variable annuity, fixed annuity and universal life businesses. Equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features, and can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC assets.  AIG Life and Retirement has implemented a number of actions to address the impact of low interest rates. These actions include a disciplined approach to pricing new business related to interest sensitive products (e.g. fixed annuities) and active management of renewal crediting rates. We have filed new life insurance and annuity products with reduced minimum rate guarantees.  Although the low interest rate environment still persists, the recent increase in interest rates has improved our outlook for our interest rate sensitive businesses. An increase in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, but rising interest rates will increase the rate earned on new investment purchases and, over time, should positively affect overall yields. Steadily increasing interest rates accompanied by a steepening in the yield curve are also favorable for fixed annuity sales as fixed annuities become more competitive in the marketplace compared to alternatives such as bank deposits. In addition, increases in interest rates will positively affect our retirement income solutions business results, as increases in interest rates generally reduce the value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities. Rapid and significant increases from current levels of interest rates, however, could result in elevated surrender activity in our interest rate sensitive products, primarily fixed annuities with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates. The extent of the increase in surrender activity, if any, will depend on the relationship of minimum guarantees embedded in certain in-force contracts relative to the pace and extent of interest rate increases. Approximately $22.5 billion, or 24 percent, of our fixed annuity account values have minimum rate guarantees greater than 3 percent.     87      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      AIG Life and Retirement Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities   •  Assets Under Management – Fully leverage a unified distribution organization to increase sales of profitable products across all channels. Capitalize on the growing demand for income solutions and on AIG Life and Retirement's capital base, risk controls, innovative product designs, expanded distribution initiatives and financial discipline to grow the variable annuity business. Pursue selected institutional market opportunities where AIG Life and Retirement's scale and capital base provide a competitive advantage.   •  Product Innovation – Develop innovative life offerings through consumer-focused research that delivers superior, differentiated product solutions.  •   Operational Efficiencies – Consolidate life insurance and annuity platforms, operations and administrative systems to create a more efficient, cost-competitive and agile operating model.  •  Return on Equity – We completed the merger of six life insurance operating legal entities into American General Life Insurance Company effective December 31, 2012. We are leveraging our streamlined legal entity structure to enhance financial strength and durability, more efficiently allocate capital and enhance the ease of doing business with us. We have also made organizational changes to achieve greater operational leverage across our businesses.  •  Investment Strategy – Consistent with AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy, AIG Life and Retirement places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies, structured securities collateralized by, among others, residential and commercial real estate, commercial mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, private equity, hedge funds, other alternative investments, and common and preferred stocks.   Our fundamental investment strategy is to maintain primarily a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to match established duration targets based on the characteristics of our liabilities. In addition, we enhance our returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships. Although these investments are subject to periodic volatility, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed income portfolio yields. Our expectation is that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the fixed income portfolio yields over the long-term while providing important diversification to our investment portfolio.  We continue to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with attractive risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. Overall our yields have been declining since the latter half of 2012 as investment purchases have been made at yields lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio. We would expect this trend to continue as long as reinvestment rates are below the weighted average yield of the investment portfolio. Although interest rates continue to be low relative to historic levels, the recent increase in interest rates has improved our reinvestment outlook.        OTHER OPERATIONS OUTLOOK       Mortgage Guaranty       Mortgage Guaranty Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities The improving U.S. mortgage market has resulted in increasing levels of mortgage originations, house value appreciation and tight mortgage underwriting standards which combined with improving U.S. macroeconomic conditions, have had a favorable impact on our operating results, most notably on the volume and quality of new business written. UGC is a leading provider of mortgage insurance and has differentiated itself from competitors through its risk-based pricing strategy initiated in 2009. This pricing strategy provides UGC's customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with underwriting risk, which we believe has resulted in an appropriately priced high quality book of business. UGC plans to continue to execute this strategy during the remainder of 2013. The new business generated since 2009 accounts for approximately 50 percent of net premiums earned for the six months ended June 30, 2013.     88      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  During the first half of 2013, low interest rates on mortgages resulted in increased refinancing activity. These low rates, along with housing price appreciation and an improvement in the overall economy have also resulted in increased home purchase activity. If interest rates were to continue to rise in the future, we would expect refinancing activities to decline. However, a decline could be offset by any increases in mortgage activity related to an increase in home sales. Additionally, in a rising interest rate environment mortgage insurance is likely to see higher persistency generating revenue over longer periods in the future.    Global Capital Markets     AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. The derivative portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives.  The remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the DIB and a portion of the legacy hedges for AIG and its subsidiaries. AIGFP's derivatives portfolio consists primarily of interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity derivatives. Additionally, AIGFP has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with our risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.    Direct Investment Book     The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all its liabilities, as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize return consistent with our risk management objectives. We are focused on meeting the DIB's liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB, without relying on resources beyond the DIB. As part of this program management, we may from time to time access the capital markets, including issuing and repurchasing debt and selling assets on an opportunistic basis, in each case subject to market conditions.  From time to time, we may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB.  Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility. The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.     89                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Results of Operations  The following section provides a comparative discussion of our Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $6.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $6.1 billion for the same period in 2012, and reflected the following:  •    pre-tax income from insurance operations of $6.1 billion and $3.5 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively;   •    aggregate pre-tax income from GCM and DIB of $1.4 billion and $796 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively;   •    loss on extinguishment of debt of $378 million resulting from redemptions of, and cash tender offers for, certain securities in the six months ended June 30, 2013;   •    net investment income in 2012 reflected an increase in fair value of AIG's interests in AIA ordinary shares and ML III of $1.3 billion and $2.6 billion; respectively; and   •    pre-tax income in 2012 included an increase in estimated litigation liability of approximately $727 million based on developments in several actions.       Results of Operations Highlights    •    AIG Property Casualty improved its accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to underwriting improvements, and posted strong net investment income performance.   •    AIG Life and Retirement continued to actively manage spread income in a continuing low interest rate environment and realized higher returns on alternative investments.   •    Our investment portfolio performance, excluding gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investments in ML II, ML III and AIA, improved due to higher returns on alternative investments, driven primarily by equity market gains.     For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, the effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was 13.4 percent and 18.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and a decrease in the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains on sales by AIG Life and Retirement of available-for-sale securities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, these items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.  For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was (29.4) percent and 9.6 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and investments in partnerships, and a decrease in the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains on sales by AIG Life and Retirement of available-for-sale securities. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.     91      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to AIG to after-tax operating income attributable to AIG:                                                        Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Net income attributable to AIG       $   2,731     $ 2,332       $   4,937     $ 5,540      Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense            (33    )    (179 )          (126    )    (243 )    Net losses on sale of divested businesses           31       –           31       2      Uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments           64       331           690       331      Legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters            (257    )    473            (321    )    477      Deferred income tax valuation allowance releases           (752    )    (1,283 )         (1,538    )    (1,576 )    Changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities           45       (45 )         64       (33 )    Change in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains            835       359            889       336      Loss on extinguishment of debt           25       6           246       6      Net realized capital gains           (1,034    )    (302 )         (1,235    )    (103 )    Non-qualifying derivative hedging gains, excluding net realized capital gains            –       (14 )          –       (13 )          After-tax operating income attributable to AIG       $   1,655     $ 1,678       $   3,637     $ 4,724           After-tax operating income attributable to AIG was flat in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. After-tax operating income attributable to AIG decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to fair value gains on AIG's previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares, ML II, and ML III, discussed above, partially offset by increases in income from insurance operations.  For the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 31.8 percent and 31.7 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.  For the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 30.8 percent and 30.7 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.

Factors that affect operating income for a specific business segment are discussed in the detailed business segment analysis.     93      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Quarterly and Year-to-date Pre-tax Income for 2013 and 2012    AIG Property Casualty — Pre-tax income increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily as a result of improved net investment income in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to the strong performance of alternative investments and income associated with the PICC P&C shares. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, improved due to the continued shift to higher value business, enhanced risk selection and improved pricing.    AIG Life and Retirement — Pre-tax income increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to higher net investment income driven by higher returns on alternative investments, increased fee income from growth in our variable annuity account value, continued active spread management related to our interest rate sensitive businesses and income from legal settlements. This increase was partially offset by the absence in 2013 of the fair value gains on ML II that were recognized in the prior-year period. Net realized capital gains increased due to gains from sales activity in connection with utilizing capital loss carryforwards, which were partially offset by the triggering of a loss recognition reserve, reflected in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred, from the subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds from these sales at lower yields.    Other Operations — Other operations recorded pre-tax income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period of 2012 due to increased pre-tax income from GCM and DIB. The pre-tax loss in the same period in 2012 included an increased estimated litigation liability. Other Operations recorded a pre-tax loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to a pre-tax gain in the same period in 2012 due to a loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the redemption of and cash tender offers for certain securities in 2013 and fair value and realized gains in 2012 from our previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares and ML III.  Mortgage Guaranty's operating income increased in the three- and six-month periods of June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012 due to higher net premiums earned in the first-lien business and settlements and commutations.     94      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table presents reconciliations of pre-tax income (loss) to operating income (loss) by reportable segment and after-tax operating income attributable to AIG, which are non-GAAP measures.

Commercial Insurance provides insurance solutions for large and small businesses. Commercial lines products are distributed through a network of independent retail and wholesale brokers, branches, and through an independent agency network in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions.    Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Consumer Insurance products are distributed through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet.  The   Other category consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including excess workers' compensation written on a stand-alone basis, reserves for asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior) claims, and certain environmental liability businesses written prior to 2004. It also includes a portion of AIG Property Casualty expenses relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, and other income (expense).  See Part 1. Item 1. Business — AIG Property Casualty in AIG's 2012 Annual Report for further discussion of AIG Property Casualty's products and geographic regions where it distributes its products.  We assess the performance of our operating segments based on operating income (loss), loss ratio, acquisition ratio, general operating expense ratio and combined ratio.     97      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  We are developing new value-based metrics that provide management with measures to evaluate our profitability, such as a risk-adjusted profitability model. Along with underwriting results, this risk-adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital and net investment income. We believe that such performance measures will allow us to better assess the true economic returns of our business.       AIG Property Casualty Quarterly and Year-to-Date 2013 Highlights     Net premiums written increased by two percent for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the growth of new business, rate increases and the impact of a change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written discussed below, which were partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. In the first quarter of 2013, we began to recognize ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period. The negative impact on net premiums written from this change in the timing of recognizing these ceded premiums in the first quarter of 2013 began to reverse in the second quarter of 2013 and will continue to reverse throughout the rest of 2013. Excluding the impact of this change and the effect of foreign exchange, Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased by approximately 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.  Net premiums written decreased by one percent for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the impact of a change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written and the effect of the Japanese yen on foreign exchange, which was partially offset by growth of new business and rate increases. Excluding the impact of excess of loss ceded premiums written and the effect of foreign exchange, Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased by approximately 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.    The loss ratio improved by 0.9 points for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit from positive pricing trends and the continued effect of the execution of our strategic initiatives, which we began implementing in the second half of 2011. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in net adverse prior year development, including related premium adjustments, primarily from Storm Sandy of $142 million. Net adverse prior year development, including related premium adjustments, during the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 totaled $154 million compared to $137 million for the same period in the prior year. Additionally, the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 benefitted from an increase in reserve discount.  The loss ratio improved by 2.9 points for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit from positive pricing trends, the continued effect of the execution of our strategic initiatives, which we began implementing in the second half of 2011, decreases in net adverse prior year development and lower catastrophe losses. Net adverse prior year development, including related premium adjustments, during the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 was $102 million, which included $142 million of adverse development from Storm Sandy, compared to $184 million for the same period in the prior year. Additionally, the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, benefitted from an increase in reserve discount.    The acquisition ratio increased by 0.4 points for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 and was unchanged for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in the prior year due in both cases to the change in business mix and direct marketing costs in Consumer Insurance, which were partially offset by decreases in the Commercial Insurance acquisition ratio related to the change in business mix and insurance-related assessments.    The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.7 points and 0.6 points for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans was offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and reduced costs for infrastructure projects. The lower net premiums earned base contributed approximately 0.7 points and 0.5 points, respectively, to the general operating expense ratio.     Net investment income increased by 14 percent and 12 percent for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the strong performance of alternative investments and income associated with the PICC P&C shares.     98                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY

AIG Property Casualty Quarterly Results  Operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in net investment income, which was partially offset by a slight increase in underwriting loss. Net investment income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the strong performance of alternative investments and income associated with the PICC P&C shares. The asset diversification strategies that we executed during 2012 enabled us to maintain similar yields in the portfolio despite the continued low interest rate environment in 2013. Adverse development on Storm Sandy increased our underwriting loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013.  See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense for further discussion of prior year development.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in Commercial Insurance related to the change in business mix, which was partially offset by an increase in Consumer Insurance due to the change in business mix and direct marketing costs.  General operating expenses decreased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense and reduced costs for infrastructure projects. This was partially offset by an increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans of $77 million, primarily due to the alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock     100      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  performance. Bad debt expense and infrastructure project expenses, in the aggregate, decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 by $49 million from $121 million in the same period in the prior year.    AIG Property Casualty Year-to-Date Results  Operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in both net investment income and underwriting income. We generated underwriting income in the first half of 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in the same period in the prior year reflecting improved current accident year losses, decreases in net adverse prior year development as well as lower catastrophe losses. Net investment income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the strong performance of alternative investments and income associated with the PICC P&C shares. The asset diversification strategies that we executed during 2012 enabled us to maintain similar yields in the portfolio despite the continued low interest rate environment in 2013.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of certain guaranty funds and other assessments in Commercial Insurance, which were partially offset by an increase in acquisition expenses in Consumer Insurance due to the change in business mix and direct marketing costs.  General operating expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans of $111 million and a $42 million increase due to the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan. The increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans was primarily due to the alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock performance, and accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible individuals in the 2013 share-based plan. This was partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense and reduced costs for infrastructure projects. Bad debt expense and infrastructure project expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 by $111 million, compared to $197 million in the same period in the prior year.    Commercial Insurance Quarterly Results  Operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an underwriting loss in the second quarter of 2013, compared to underwriting income in the second quarter of 2012, and a reduction in allocated net investment income due to a decrease in risk-free rates. The underwriting loss resulted from an increase in net prior year adverse loss development and higher catastrophe losses. This was partially offset by improvement in our current accident year losses, reflecting rate increases and enhanced risk selection, as well as lower acquisition expenses. Net prior year adverse development, including related premium adjustments, was $187 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to $2 million in the same period in the prior year. The three-month period ended June 30, 2013 includes approximately $164 million of adverse development from Storm Sandy. This development resulted from higher severities on a small number of existing large and complex commercial claims. These increased severities were driven by a number of factors, including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown New York metropolitan area. In the three-month period ended June 30, 2013, catastrophe losses were $307 million compared to $288 million in the same period in 2012.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of certain guaranty funds and other assessments and the change in business mix.  General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed, which was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.    Commercial Insurance Year-to-Date Results  Operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to underwriting income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in the same period of 2012, partially offset by a decrease in allocated net investment income as a result of a decrease in risk-free rates. Commercial Insurance generated underwriting income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to improved current accident year losses, rate increases, enhanced risk selection, and slightly lower catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by an increase in net prior year adverse loss development. In the six-month period ended     101      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  June 30, 2013, catastrophe losses were $340 million compared to $364 million in the same period in 2012. Net prior year adverse development, including related premium adjustments was $116 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, which includes $164 million of adverse development related to Storm Sandy, compared to $30 million in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of guaranty funds and other assessments, as well as change in business mix.  General operating expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed, which was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.     Consumer Insurance Quarterly Results  Operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in both underwriting income and allocated net investment income. Underwriting income decreased due to increases in acquisition expenses, investment in strategic business expansion in growth economy nations, and the change in business mix towards higher value products, offset in part by lower catastrophe losses and higher net prior year favorable development. Allocated net investment income decreased due to a decrease in risk-free rates. Catastrophe losses for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 were $9 million, compared to $40 million during the same period in the prior year. Net prior year favorable development was $53 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013, compared to $36 million in the prior year. The second quarter of 2013 includes approximately $22 million of favorable development for Storm Sandy driven primarily by the reduction of reserves for excess flood policies indicated from completed property inspections and lower than expected severity on certain other policy claims.  Acquisition expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the change in business mix and direct marketing costs in growth-targeted lines of business. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 were $118 million, compared to $103 million during the same period in the prior year. These expenses, while not deferrable, are expected to generate business that has an average expected overall persistency of approximately 5 years and, in Japan, approximately 9 years.  General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to reduced costs for infrastructure projects.    Consumer Insurance Year-to-Date Results  Operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in both underwriting income and allocated net investment income. Underwriting income decreased due to increases in acquisition expenses, investment in strategic business expansion in growth economy nations, and the change in business mix towards higher value products, offset in part by lower catastrophe losses and higher net prior year favorable development. Allocated net investment income decreased due to a decrease in risk-free rates. Catastrophe losses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 were $17 million, compared to $44 million during the same period in the prior year. Net prior year favorable development was $95 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, compared to $50 million in the prior year period. The first half of 2013 included approximately $43 million of favorable development from Storm Sandy.  Acquisition expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the change in business mix and direct marketing costs in growth targeted lines of business, particularly in the life and A&H businesses. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 were $225 million, compared to $209 million during the same period in the prior year.  General operating expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to reduced costs for infrastructure projects, which were partially offset by the increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed and the strategic expansion in growth economy nations.     102      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY      AIG Property Casualty Net Premiums Written     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty net premiums written by major line of business:                                                                      Three Months Ended June 30,          Six Months Ended June 30,               Percentage Change     Percentage Change       (in millions)     2013     2012      2013     2012            Commercial Insurance                                                  Casualty       $   2,110     $ 2,181      (3 )%     $   4,354     $ 4,533      (4 )%    Property          1,770       1,447     22          2,453       2,419     1      Specialty          882       864     2          1,854       1,854     –      Financial lines          1,114       1,076     4          2,118       1,985     7          Total net premiums written       $   5,876     $ 5,568     6 %     $   10,779     $ 10,791     – %          Consumer Insurance                                                  Accident & Health       $   1,645     $ 1,696      (3 )%     $   3,438     $ 3,503      (2 )%    Personal lines          1,745       1,832     (5 )        3,484       3,622     (4 )          Total net premiums written       $   3,390     $ 3,528      (4 )%     $   6,922     $ 7,125      (3 )%          Other          (3    )    (1 )   (200 )        (1    )    (1 )   –          Total AIG Property Casualty net premiums written       $   9,263     $ 9,095     2 %     $   17,700     $ 17,915      (1 )%                    103                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY    Commercial Insurance Net Premiums Written  During the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, Commercial Insurance continued to focus on the execution of its strategic objectives.  Casualty net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the execution of our strategy to improve loss ratios as well as to increase specific reinsurance purchases to better manage our exposures. Changes in reinsurance strategy decreased net premiums written by $78 million and $135 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We implemented rate increases in retained business, especially in the U.S., that partially offset these premium decreases.  Property net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in new business, increases in coverage limits and changes to our per-risk reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure. The increase in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 also reflected a $197 million benefit from the impact of a change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written described below, as well as a $102 million benefit from non-renewal of certain reinsurance programs. Catastrophe-exposed business in the Americas also benefitted from rate increases.  Effective January 1, 2013, we began to recognize the annual ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period. Previously, we recognized ceded premiums written on these agreements based on the quarterly contractual remittance requirements, and recorded an adjustment at the end of the contract term to reflect the actual ceded premiums written amounts. This change resulted in the acceleration of ceded premiums written to earlier quarters, but had only a de minimis effect on net premiums earned. As a result of this change, ceded premiums written for the three month period ended June 30, 2013 decreased by $197 million compared to the same period in the prior year. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, ceded premiums written increased by $201 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The impact on net premiums written from this change will continue to reverse throughout the rest of 2013.  Net premiums written for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, also reflected the timing of a catastrophe bond issuance. We have continued our strategy, adopted in 2010, of improving the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. During the first quarter of 2013, as part of this strategy, we secured a three-year catastrophe bond providing for up to $400 million in protection against U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes to the extent both industry losses and our actual losses exceed specific thresholds. The bond transaction reduced net premiums written by $96 million in the first six months of 2013. Our previous catastrophe bond issuance occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Specialty net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to rate increases in small-and medium-sized enterprise markets in the Americas region and in the environmental business, as well as the restructuring of our reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, which increased net premiums written by $25 million compared to the same period in the prior year.  Specialty net premiums written were unchanged for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in prior year.  Financial lines net premiums written increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products, particularly in the EMEA region as well as an improved rate environment globally. Global professional indemnity net premiums written increased by $25 million and $60 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, due to the restructuring of our reinsurance program, as part of our decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, as well as by improved rates and strong new business growth.    Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written  Consumer Insurance net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. The decreases for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013     104      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  also reflected the effect of a change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss reinsurance ceded written premiums discussed above. Excluding these items, net premiums written in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year as the business continued to build momentum through multiple distribution channels and continuing focus on direct marketing. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net premiums written generated by direct marketing increased by approximately 5.0 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, and accounted for approximately 16.2 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively, of Consumer Insurance net premiums written.  A&H net premiums written, excluding foreign exchange, increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of our focus on the growth of Fuji Life products, direct marketing, and individual A&H in Asia Pacific. In addition, travel business continued to increase in most geographies across the globe. Americas continued its strategy of repositioning U.S. direct marketing operations and maintaining our pricing discipline and underwriting targets. As a result, several programs in the group personal accident business were not renewed in the first half of 2013.  Personal lines net premiums written, excluding foreign exchange, increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of growth in automobile products and the continued execution of our strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business in non-automobile products. Automobile products reported growth in EMEA as our market share continued to improve over local competition in key countries. Non-automobile products also reported continued growth, including increases in Europe specialty products and personal property in Asia Pacific due to our focus on diversifying the global product mix. For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, the increases were partially offset by an increase from the impact of a change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written described above of $38 million and $85 million, respectively. In addition, the timing of the catastrophe bond issuance in the first quarter of 2013 reduced net premiums written by $20 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period.

The Americas net premiums written decreased slightly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of the increase in ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements discussed above of approximately $149 million, and approximately $120 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, due to the timing of a catastrophe bond issuance. These items, which affected both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, were partially offset by rate increases in Commercial Insurance and continued growth in the personal property and private client group in Consumer Insurance.  Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding foreign exchange, net premiums written increased primarily due to an increase in Consumer Insurance, reflecting growth of Fuji Life products and direct marketing business in Japan. The expansion of business in Asia Pacific countries outside of Japan also continued in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, supported by growth in individual personal accident insurance, direct marketing and personal lines products. Commercial Insurance increased in the Asia Pacific region primarily due to organic growth and rate increases in Property, Specialty, and Casualty. In addition, our decision to retain more favorable risks in Property and Financial lines increased net premiums written during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013.  EMEA net premiums written increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting Commercial Insurance growth due to new business growth, a change in reinsurance strategies to retain more favorable risks in Property and Financial lines, and rate improvements on retained business, as well as growth in Consumer Insurance travel, warranty, and specialty personal lines products. Additionally, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013, the change in timing of recognizing ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements, discussed above, increased net premiums written by approximately $57 million, while for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, it decreased net premiums written by approximately $173 million.     106                Table of

Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophe individual first party losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance.     Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Ratios  The improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 reflects the realization of benefits from the continued execution of our multi-faceted strategy to enhance risk selection, pricing discipline, exposure management and claims processing. Although the execution of these strategies resulted in a reduction of Casualty net premiums written, it also improved the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, as we continued to remediate our primary and excess Casualty books in both the Americas and EMEA regions. Financial lines improved due to rate strengthening, restructuring and re-underwriting of certain products. Severe losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 represented approximately 0.7 point and 1.0 point, respectively, compared to 1.3 points and 1.0 point in the same periods in the prior year, respectively, and are included in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. Net prior year adverse development including related premium adjustments represents 4.4 points and 1.6 points of the loss ratio in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to net prior year (favorable)/adverse development of (0.1) point and 0.2 points in the respective prior-year periods. Adverse development on Storm Sandy added 3.2 points and 1.8 points, respectively, to the loss ratios for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013.  The acquisition ratio decreased by 0.9 points and 1.3 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to change in business mix and timing of insurance-related assessments.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 1.4 points and 0.5 points, respectively, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in employee incentive compensation plan expense, previously discussed, was slightly offset by decreases in bad debt expenses. The lower net premiums earned base contributed approximately 0.7 points and 0.4 points, respectively, to the general operating     110      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  expense ratio. Employee incentive plan expense contributed approximately 1.1 points and 0.8 points, respectively, to the increase in the general operating expense ratio. Bad debt expenses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 represent a decrease of approximately 0.4 points and 0.8 points, respectively, over the same periods in 2012.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Ratios  The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 1.1 points and 0.8 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher losses associated with a warranty retail program, which increased the loss ratio by 1.5 points and 0.8 points, respectively. This was partially offset by improvements in Personal lines, primarily automobile, as a result of rate and underwriting actions taken in current and prior years in Japan, as well as from improvements in the U.S. private client group, Japan property and Asia Pacific A&H business. Storm Sandy favorable development reduced the loss ratio by 0.7 points and 0.6 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively.  The acquisition ratio increased by 2.4 points and 1.8 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the change in business mix and direct marketing costs in growth-targeted lines of business. Direct marketing spend, excluding commissions, increased by approximately 15 percent and 8 percent in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.3 points and 0.6 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the increase in employee incentive compensation plan expense previously discussed, which was partially offset by a decrease of 0.1 points and 0.2 points in infrastructure project costs, respectively. The lower net premiums earned base contributed approximately 0.9 points and 0.6 points, respectively, to the general operating expense ratio.     Other Category  We incurred lower general operating expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to reduced costs for infrastructure projects that are not specific to either Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance. This contributed approximately 0.2 points to the decrease to the AIG Property Casualty general operating expense ratio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. We continue to invest in a number of infrastructure projects, including the implementation of global finance and information systems, compliance with the regulatory requirements of the FRB, legal entity restructuring, and underwriting and claims improvement initiatives.  We incurred higher general operating expenses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily related to our implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan, which contributed approximately 0.2 points in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 to the AIG Property Casualty general operating expense ratio.      AIG Property Casualty Investing and Other Results     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty's investing and other results:                                                                   Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,                 Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)       2013     2012       2013      2012            Net investment income                                                Commercial Insurance         $   623    $ 711      (12 )%     $   1,268    $ 1,442      (12 )%    Consumer Insurance            92      115     (20 )         190      231     (18 )    Other            595      327     82           1,210      703     72          Total net investment income           1,310      1,153     14           2,668      2,376     12      Net realized capital gains (losses)           73      23     217           85      (112 )   NM      Other income — net           10      2     400           13      4     225          Investing and other results       $   1,393    $ 1,178     18 %     $   2,766    $ 2,268     22 %              111      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  We manage and account for our invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements. Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as the Other category. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments.  Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and the Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to the Other category. Commencing in the first quarter of 2013, we began applying similar duration and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) to the allocated capital of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance as is applied to loss reserves.  Net realized capital gains (losses) and Other income (expense) — net are not allocated to Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, but are reported as part of the Other category.    Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Investment Income  Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the interest rate environment and changes in overall asset allocation. Certain of our structured securities and our additional investment in PICC P&C shares acquired in the PICC P&C rights offering are accounted for under the fair value option, which may also increase the volatility of our net investment income. The increase in the fair value of structured securities in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 was offset by a decrease in interest income from available for sale securities. Net investment income increased by $157 million, or 14 percent, and $292 million, or 12 percent, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to the strong performance in alternative investments.  Corporate debt securities continues to be our largest asset category. We continued to reduce our concentration in lower yielding tax-exempt municipal bond holdings and focus on risk-weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities. This asset diversification has achieved an increase in average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity investments were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to execute our investment strategy in 2013 to meet our liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  Net investment income from investment categories other than debt securities increased by $180 million and $343 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, approximately $129 million and $256 million, respectively, were attributed to the strong performance of alternative investments, following an approximate 2 percent and 18 percent increase in the S&P 500 Index in the respective periods. Investment income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 includes a $58 million gain related to the PICC P&C shares. Income from the life settlement portfolios also increased by approximately $40 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.    Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 were driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities of $88 million and $159 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, partially offset by impairment charges on life settlement contracts of approximately $38 million and $87 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as a result of decreases in their estimated fair value and other-than-temporary impairment charges of $9 million and $27 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively.  Net realized capital gains for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities in the amount of $165 million. This was partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $96 million, primarily attributable to publicly traded and privately held equity securities in the Japan portfolios and a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities. In addition, impairment charges of $56 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period.     112                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE  Net realized capital losses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 were primarily driven by other-than-temporary impairments of $299 million, primarily attributable to a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities, and partnership investments and equity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. In addition, impairment charges of $114 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period. These items were partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity securities of $329 million.

AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. We regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years' estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years' estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.  The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance, less applicable discount for future investment income.

While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of June 30, 2013. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.  For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in the Commercial Insurance operating segment and Other that was partially offset by net favorable development in the Consumer Insurance operating segment. The net adverse development in Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to domestic property exposures mostly due to the increase in reserves for Storm Sandy, and by adverse development in the primary Casualty lines, primarily from loss-sensitive business that was entirely offset by additional premiums and higher than expected legal costs on claims for construction defects policies covering artisan contractors from accident years 2004 and prior. The adverse development on those classes was partially offset by case reductions on some large claims and favorable development on other short-lived classes. The adverse development in Other for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 included adverse development on legacy asbestos and environmental exposures (1986 and prior). In addition, the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 included adverse development on run-off environmental exposures (1987 – 2003).  The favorable development in Consumer Insurance was due to lower than expected losses in Personal lines, including decreases in reserves for Storm Sandy, and non-catastrophe losses.  For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in Commercial Insurance and Other, which was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves in Consumer Insurance. The net adverse development in Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on large excess casualty cases, primarily casualty and environmental business (policies written after 1987), partially offset by favorable development in domestic property exposures and catastrophe losses. The favorable development in Consumer Insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe losses in Personal lines. The adverse development in Other included adverse development on run-off environmental exposures (1987 – 2003).  AIG Property Casualty recognized additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $70 million and $80 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to returned premiums of $20 million and $14 million in the same periods in the prior year, respectively. In addition, we incurred reinstatement premiums of $14 million and $25 million for the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, associated with the development on prior years' catastrophes.  See AIG Property Casualty Results herein and Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.      Asbestos and Environmental Reserves     The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  As described more fully in the 2012 Annual Report, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis performed periodically. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, AIG increased its gross asbestos reserves by $23 million and its net asbestos reserves by $13 million to reflect a small amount of uncollectible reinsurance and accretion of discount. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, AIG increased its gross environmental reserves by $61 million and its net environmental reserves by $38 million as a result of recent actuarial analyses performed as well as development on one large account.     116      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE  In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, AIG Property Casualty also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $127 million gross and $104 million net as of June 30, 2013.

Private equity and hedge fund investment income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 increased $265 million, or 156 percent, compared to the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 and $473 million or 104 percent for the six- month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to favorable equity market conditions and income recorded on several large redemptions from hedge funds.  •A decrease in the fair value of our investment in PICC Group of $84 million and $53 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively. •Continued strong sales in retirement income solutions primarily driven by increased variable annuity sales as deposits for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 increased by $878 million and $1.1 billion, an increase of 65 percent and 45 percent, respectively, over the prior year periods.       AIG Life and Retirement Operations  In 2012, AIG Life and Retirement announced several key organizational structure and management changes intended to better serve the organization's distribution partners and customers. Key aspects of the new structure are distinct product divisions, shared annuity and life operations platforms and a unified all-channel distribution organization with access to all AIG Life and Retirement products.

Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  Prior period amounts were conformed to the current period presentation. These changes did not affect operating income or pre-tax income. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       AIG Life and Retirement Quarterly Operating Income  Operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by higher net investment income, increased fee income from growth in our variable annuity account value, and continued active spread management related to our interest rate sensitive businesses, offset in part by an increase in policyholder benefits and claims incurred.  Premiums increased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year as higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums were partially offset by lower term insurance and immediate annuity premiums.  Policy fees increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of growth in variable annuity assets under management from higher net flows and positive separate account performance, driven in large part by higher equity markets.  Net investment income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 as higher returns on alternative investments and higher call and tender income were partially offset by fair value losses of $84 million on our investment in PICC Group and lower base yields of 15 basis points in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Recent investment purchases have been made at yields lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio.  Other income primarily consists of commission revenues earned by affiliated broker dealers from the sale of investment products and life insurance. The increase in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 was primarily as a result of the acquisition of Woodbury Financial in November 2012.  Policyholder benefits and claims incurred increased compared to the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 due to higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums.  Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 due to active crediting rate management actions, which included lowering renewal crediting rates and maintaining disciplined new business pricing.  Amortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 due to the impact of favorable separate account performance compared to the same period in the prior year.  Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher commission expenses associated with brokerage activities as a result of the acquisition of Woodbury Financial in November 2012.     121      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT    AIG Life and Retirement Year-To-Date Operating Income  Operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012, primarily driven by higher net investment income, increased fee income from growth in our variable annuity account value, and continued active spread management related to our interest rate sensitive businesses.  Premiums increased slightly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year as higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums were partially offset by lower term insurance and immediate annuity premiums.  Policy fees increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012 as a result of growth in variable annuity assets under management from higher net flows and positive separate account performance, driven in large part by higher equity markets in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013.  Net investment income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 as higher returns on alternative investments and higher call and tender income were partially offset by fair value losses of $53 million on our investment in PICC Group, the absence of ML II fair value gains of $246 million that were recognized in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 and lower base yields of 18 basis points in 2013 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2012. The decline in base yields is due to the impact of the current low interest rate environment.  Other income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Woodbury Financial in November 2012.  Policyholder benefits and claims incurred increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 due to higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums.

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, consistent with lower fixed annuity reserves. The favorable separate account returns in our retirement income business resulted in lower amortization in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013. If favorable equity market performance continues for the remainder of 2013, an unlocking of assumptions of estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC, VOBA and SIA could occur. However, such positive unlocking, if any, is not expected to be significant to AIG Life and Retirement's operating results.

Policyholder benefits and claims incurred increased primarily due to higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums  Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher compensation related expenses.    Legal Settlements  In the three-month period ended June 30, 2013, we recorded income of $359 million from settlements with financial institutions that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which AIG and its subsidiaries realized losses during the financial crisis. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, we recorded income of $467 million related to these legal settlements.    Changes in Fair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Designated to Hedge Living Benefit Liabilities  AIG Life and Retirement has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatilities related to embedded derivative liabilities contained in guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities. We substantially hedge our exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a portion of our interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, we began purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce our interest rate risk exposure over time. As a result of increases in interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities, the fair value of the U.S. Treasury securities used for hedging, net of financing costs, decreased by $69 million and $98 million in the three-month and six-month period ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to increases of $70 million and $51 million, respectively in the prior-year periods.    Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains were $1.4 billion in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to gains of $326 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase is due to gains from investment sales activity in connection with utilizing capital loss carryforwards as well as $180 million of fair value gains on variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of hedges. The embedded derivative gains in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 were primarily due to increases in long-term interest rates.  Net realized capital gains were $1.6 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to losses of $140 million in the same period of the prior year. The improvement from the prior year is due to higher gains from sales activity, lower other than temporary impairments and fair value gains on variable annuity embedded derivatives of $131 million compared to losses of $490 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012. The embedded     124      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  derivative gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 were primarily due to increases in long-term interest rates in 2013.    Changes in Benefit Reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA Related to Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  In connection with utilizing capital loss tax carryforwards, we sold investments in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012. These and other sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition on certain long-term payout annuity contracts of $1.1 billion in the three-month period ended June 2013, and $460 million in the same period of 2012, which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized losses (included in AOCI) to actual loss recognition (included in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred) and transferred related shadow DAC (included in AOCI) to Amortization of deferred acquisition costs. We recognized a loss of $1.2 billion and $488 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Additional sales of such securities are contemplated in the remainder of 2013, which could result in additional loss recognition. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves. In addition, due to the reinvestment of the assets at lower yields, earnings related to this payout annuity block of business are expected to decline in the remainder of 2013.  The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in AIG Life and Retirement DAC/VOBA:                                      Six Months Ended June 30,    (in millions)       2013      2012            Balance, beginning of year         $   5,672     $ 6,502          Acquisition costs deferred           409       395      Amortization expense           (390     )   (462 )    Change in net unrealized gains on securities           469       (353 )    Other           (4     )   –          Balance, end of period       $   6,156     $ 6,082           Because AIG Life and Retirement operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest yield assumptions in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.  DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and group retirement products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant judgment. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for additional information on DAC and VOBA recoverability.    Premiums  Premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums and deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts, GICs and mutual funds.  The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:                                                        Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Premiums and deposits       $   6,765     $ 5,434       $   12,345     $ 10,994      Deposits            (5,957      )   (4,617 )         (10,761      )   (9,412 )    Other           (159     )   (185 )          (315      )   (336 )          Premiums         $   649     $ 632         $   1,269     $ 1,246              125      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  The following table presents the components of premiums and deposits by line of business for AIG Life and Retirement:                                                                      Three Months Ended June 30,          Six Months Ended June 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Premiums and deposits:                                                  Retail                                                 Life Insurance & A&H       $   840    $ 850      (1 )%     $   1,675    $ 1,682     – %    Fixed Annuities           355      465     (24 )         731      1,049     (30 )    Retirement Income Solutions           2,233      1,355     65           3,646      2,514     45      Retail Mutual Funds           1,216      619     96           2,049      1,368     50      Closed Blocks           22      40     (45 )         51      79     (35 )          Total Retail       $   4,666    $ 3,329     40 %     $   8,152    $ 6,692     22 %          Institutional                                                Group Retirement         $   1,705    $ 1,738      (2 )%     $   3,445    $ 3,582      (4 )%    Institutional Markets            223      194     15           404      375     8      Group Benefits            171      173     (1 )         344      345     –          Total Institutional           2,099      2,105     –           4,193      4,302     (3 )          Total premiums and deposit        $   6,765    $ 5,434     24 %     $   12,345    $ 10,994     12 %                    126                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  Total premiums and deposits increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 due to significant increases in retirement income solutions and retail mutual fund deposits.  Retirement income solutions deposits increased, primarily driven by increased variable annuity sales that benefitted from innovative product enhancements, expanded distribution as well as a more favorable competitive environment. Retail mutual fund sales increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, principally driven by SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.'s Focused Dividend Strategy product offerings. Fixed annuity deposits continued to be negatively affected by the sustained low interest rate environment as consumers are reluctant to purchase these products at the relatively low crediting rates currently offered. Group retirement deposits (which include deposits into mutual funds and fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) decreased due to lower levels of individual rollover deposits and periodic deposits in 2013, partially offset by higher mutual fund deposits. Premiums from life insurance products were essentially flat for both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013.    Net Flows  The following table summarizes net flows for fixed annuities, retirement income solutions, retail mutual funds and group retirement:                                                         Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Net flows*                                      Fixed annuities       $   (1,264    )  $ (1,009 )     $   (2,263    )  $ (1,827 )    Retirement income solutions          1,292       588          1,863       923      Retail mutual funds          688       209          989       579      Group retirement          (299    )    238          (415    )    465          Total net flows       $   417     $ 26       $   174     $ 140            * Annuities net flows represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows on retail mutual funds are deposits less withdrawals. Net flows presented excludes net flows activity on certain closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities reserves totaling $6 billion.   Overall net flows increased in both the three- and six month-periods ended June 30, 2013 due to improvements in net flows for retirement income solutions, primarily driven by variable annuity sales and increased retail mutual funds sales, partially offset by lower net flows for fixed annuities and group retirement products. Group retirement net flows declined in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, primarily driven by an increase in large group surrenders and, to a lesser extent, higher individual surrenders. Net flows for fixed annuities also declined in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, due to lower fixed annuity deposits resulting from the low interest rate environment and increased surrenders due to higher levels of in-force business reaching the end of the surrender charge period.     127      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND

Low Interest Rate Environment     A variety of factors affect AIG Life and Retirement's businesses, and the life insurance and annuity industry in general, during a prolonged low interest rate environment. Declining interest rates result in higher fair values of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities and may result in improved persistency of certain lines of business. A sustained low interest rate environment may also result in lower sales of fixed annuities and other products and lower net investment spreads as portfolio cash flows are reinvested at lower rates (spread compression). We have taken a number of actions to mitigate these impacts, as discussed below.       AIG Life and Retirement has addressed the impact of sustained low interest rates with a number of actions taken on both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet:    •Opportunistic investment in structured securities to increase yields  •Continued disciplined approach to new business pricing  •Active management of renewal crediting rates  •Re-priced certain life insurance and annuity products to reflect current low rate environment   •Re-filed certain products to continue lowering minimum rate guarantees  •Included product limits where appropriate to minimize exposure to low interest rates  As a result of these actions, we estimate that the effect of interest rates remaining at or near current levels through the end of 2013 on pre-tax operating income would not be material, and would be modestly more significant with respect to 2014 results. In addition, the recent increase in interest rates has improved our outlook for our interest rate sensitive businesses as a rising interest rate environment will increase the rate earned on new investment purchases and, over time, will positively affect overall yields. Steadily increasing interest rates accompanied by a steepening in the yield curve are also favorable for fixed annuity sales as fixed annuities become more competitive in the marketplace compared to alternatives such as bank deposits.     Opportunistic Investments: The majority of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities consist of intermediate- and long-term fixed maturity securities. We generally purchase assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. Opportunistic investments in structured securities, private placement corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans continue to be made to improve yields, increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment.    Disciplined New Business Pricing: New fixed annuity sales have declined in the first six months of 2013 relative to the same period in 2012, due to the relatively low crediting rates offered as a result of our disciplined approach to new business. However, even in the current interest rate environment, we continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads. New sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum     129      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  interest rate guarantees of 1 percent. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted net investment spreads.     Active Management of Renewal Crediting Rates: The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in our products may have the effect, in a continued low interest rate environment, of reducing our spreads and thus reducing future profitability. Although we partially mitigate this interest rate risk through our asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. Our annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We have adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in-force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees. In addition to annuity and universal life products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment.  As indicated in the table below, approximately 74 percent of our annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of June 30, 2013, an increase from 61 percent at December 31, 2012. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of June 30, 2013 ranging from 1 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products.

To the extent that we cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, current products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower rates as permitted under state insurance product regulations.        Other Operations  AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty, GCM, DIB, Retained Interests and Corporate & Other (after allocations to AIG's business segments) as presented below.     130      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / OTHER OPERATIONS    Mortgage Guaranty (United Guaranty Corporation or UGC) offers private residential mortgage guaranty insurance, which protects mortgage lenders and investors from loss due to borrower default and loan foreclosure. The coverage we provide — which is called mortgage guaranty insurance, mortgage insurance, or simply "MI" — enables borrowers to purchase a house with a modest down payment by protecting lenders against the increased risk of borrower default related to high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages — those with less than 20 percent equity.    Global Capital Markets consists of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, or are currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.    Direct Investment Book consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The management of the DIB portfolio is focused on an orderly wind down to maximize returns consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.    Retained Interests includes the fair value gains or losses, prior to their sale in 2012, of the AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering and the fair value gains or losses, prior to the FRBNY liquidation of ML III assets in 2012, on the retained interest in ML III.    Corporate & Other consists primarily of interest expense, consolidation and eliminations, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, certain expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, the results of AIG's real estate investment operations and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses and properties that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment.

Remedy claims represent the indemnification for losses incurred by lenders arising from obligations contractually assumed by UGC as a result of underwriting services provided to lenders during times of high loan origination activity.  In addition to the total $28 million positive impact to quarterly results from settlements and commutations cited above, UGC released $21 million in reserves during the period.     133      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / OTHER OPERATIONS    Mortgage Guaranty Year-to-Date Results  Mortgage Guaranty recorded an increase in operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to:  •a $54 million increase in net premiums earned, reflecting a $64 million increase due to growth in first-lien insurance written, partially offset by a decline on second-lien and international businesses, both of which were placed into run-off during 2008; and •a $21 million decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred, primarily due to a $36 million decline in second-lien, student loan and international claims and claims adjustment expenses, partially offset by a $15 million increase in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expense. Declines in the second-lien and student loan businesses reflect a decrease in net claims and claims adjustment expenses as collections of recoveries on prior paid losses continued and more contracts reached their respective stop loss limits; the decline in international claims and claims adjustment expenses reflects improving loss experience during the year and the de-risking of the international business through commutations as noted above. First-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses increased, primarily reflecting lower favorable loss development.  New insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, increased due to the market acceptance of UGC's risk-based pricing model by an increasing number of lenders as well as the addition and expansion of distribution channels.

Global Capital Markets Operations       Global Capital Markets Quarterly Results  GCM reported pre-tax and operating income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to pre-tax and operating losses in the same period in 2012, primarily due to improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities and improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $81 million were recognized in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013, compared to net credit valuation losses of $54 million for the same period in 2012. The improvement resulted primarily from gains on derivative assets for the second quarter of 2013 due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads compared to losses on those assets for the second quarter of 2012 due to the widening of such spreads. These gains were partially offset by losses on derivative liabilities for the second quarter of 2013 due to the tightening of AIG's credit spreads compared to gains on those liabilities for the second quarter of 2012 due to the widening of such spreads.  Unrealized market valuation gains of $131 million and $57 million, were recognized in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The improvement resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio.    Global Capital Markets Year-to-Date Results  GCM's pre-tax and operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities and improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the CDS portfolio.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $134 million were recognized in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013, compared to net credit valuation losses of $76 million for the same period in 2012. The improvement resulted primarily from higher gains on derivative assets due to more significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 and lower losses on derivative liabilities due to less significant tightening of AIG's credit spreads in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2012.  Unrealized market valuation gains of $302 million and $197 million, were recognized in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The improvement resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio.     134      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / OTHER OPERATIONS      Direct Investment Book Results     The following table presents Direct Investment book results:                                           Three Months Ended June 30,          Six Months Ended June 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Operating income       $   591     $ 434     36 %     $   920     $ 278     231 %          Legal settlements          27       –     NM          27       –     NM      Loss on extinguishment of debt          –       –     NM          (4    )    –     NM      Net realized capital gains          102       51     100          89       455     (80 )          Pre-tax income       $   720     $ 485     48 %     $   1,032     $ 733     41 %             Direct Investment Book Quarterly Results  DIB pre-tax income and operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to fair value appreciation on asset-backed security (ABS) CDOs that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by less significant net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The improvement in pre-tax income was also driven by unrealized gains on interest rate swap hedge positions related to ABS CDO investments.  Fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs was $478 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2013 driven primarily by improved collateral pricing due to improvements in home price indices and amortization of the underlying collateral. The unrealized gains on interest rate swap hedge positions were the result of interest rate increases late in the second quarter of 2013.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $67 million and $321 million were recognized for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the portfolio size due to sales and maturities as well as reduced counterparty spread narrowing compared to the prior year quarter.    Direct Investment Book Year-to-Date Results  DIB pre-tax income and operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012 and improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The improvement in pre-tax income was partially offset by lower Net realized capital gains.  Fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs was $586 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 driven primarily by improved collateral pricing due to improvements in home price indices and amortization of the underlying collateral.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $293 million and $130 million were recognized for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The improvement resulted primarily from lower losses on liabilities, partially offset by lower gains on assets due to less significant tightening of both AIG's credit spreads and counterparty credit spreads in the six-month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.  The change in Net realized capital gains was driven by a $426 million gain on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P. in the first quarter of 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on interest rate swap hedge positions as a result of interest rate increases late in the second quarter of 2013.     135      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / OTHER OPERATIONS  The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the DIB (excluding intercompany transactions):                                    Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets:                                        Bond trading securities       $   49     $ 248       $   299     $ 602      Loans and other assets          (1    )    10          9       23          Increase in assets          48       258          308       625          AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities:                                      Notes and bonds payable          (4    )    44          (40    )    (399 )    Guaranteed Investment Agreements          23       17          28       (73 )    Other liabilities          –       2          (3    )    (23 )          Decrease (increase) in liabilities          19       63          (15    )    (495 )          Net increase to operating income       $   67     $ 321       $   293     $ 130               Retained Interests        Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities Prior to Their Sale  On March 7, 2012, AIG sold approximately 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA and recognized a gain of $0.6 billion. The fair value of AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities decreased $493 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2012 and increased $0.7 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012.     Change in Fair Value of ML III Prior to Liquidation  The gains attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were based in part on sales of ML III assets by the FRBNY.      Corporate & Other       Quarterly and Year-to-Date Corporate & Other Results  Corporate & Other reported an increase in operating losses in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs due to performance relative to incentive targets in 2013 offset by reductions in interest expense from overall reduced debt.      Legal Reserves     Legal reserves in 2012 relate to increased estimated litigation liability during the second quarter of 2012 based on developments in several actions.      Net Loss on Sale of Divested Businesses     On May 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain non-core insurance subsidiaries, which we expect, subject to customary closing conditions, will close before the end of the year. We recognized a pre-tax loss in connection with this sale of approximately $47 million during the second quarter of 2013.     136                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS         Discontinued Operations  Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations is comprised of the following:                                    Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,        (in millions)      2013      2012       2013      2012            ILFC       $   638     $ 82       $   1,234     $ 200      Net gain (loss) on sale            (591    )    (8 )          (1,027    )    12          Income from discontinued operations           47       74           207       212      Income tax expense (benefit)           14       (105 )         81       (31 )          Income from discontinued operations, net of tax       $   33     $ 179       $   126     $ 243           Significant items affecting the comparison of results from discontinued operations in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 included pre-tax income of $638 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, largely offset by a pre-tax loss on the sale of ILFC of $619 million and $1.2 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, both reflecting the absence of depreciation and amortization expense because ILFC is classified as held for sale, and a pre-tax gain of $28 million and $145 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, in connection with the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) mostly attributable to refund of taxes, interest and penalties, recognized in the first quarter of 2013.  See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations.        Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)  The following table presents AIG's consolidated comprehensive income (loss):                                                                       Three Months Ended June 30,          Six Months Ended June 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)      2013      2012       2013      2012            Net income       $   2,758     $ 2,339     18 %     $   4,989     $ 5,788      (14 )%          Change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments          (10,084    )    2,080     NM          (11,277    )    4,791     NM      Change in deferred acquisition costs adjustment and other          854       (119 )   NM          543       (498 )   NM      Change in future policy benefits          2,116       (101 )   NM          2,540       (67 )   NM      Change in foreign currency translation adjustments          (273    )    (512 )   47          (566    )    (425 )   (33 )    Change in net derivative gains arising from cash flow hedging activities          –       4     NM          –       8     NM      Change in retirement plan liabilities adjustment          34       17     100          77       46     67      Deferred tax asset (liability)          2,532       (459 )   NM          3,127       (1,220 )   NM          Other comprehensive income (loss)          (4,821    )    910     NM          (5,556    )    2,635     NM          Comprehensive income (loss)          (2,063    )    3,249     NM          (567    )    8,423     NM          Total comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests          6       (1 )   NM          31       245     (87 )          Comprehensive income attributable to AIG       $   (2,069    )  $ 3,250     NM %     $   (598    )  $ 8,178     NM %              137                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)    Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments     The increases in unrealized depreciation of investments in 2013 were primarily attributable to depreciation in bonds available for sale due to an increase in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities, particularly during the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by narrowing spreads of high yield securities.  The increases in unrealized appreciation of investments in 2012 were primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and significant spread tightening partially offset by higher U.S. treasury rates.    Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other     The increases in DAC in 2013 compared to 2012 were primarily the result of decreases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest-sensitive products.    Change in Future Policy Benefits     The change in future policy benefits reserves in 2013 is due to loss reserve recognition in net income resulting from sales of securities in unrealized gain positions as well as decreases in unrealized gains resulting from increases in long term rates. The change in future policy benefits reserves in 2012 was driven by declines in interest rates during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012. Changes in unrealized appreciation of investments result in changes to future policy benefits which are recorded through Other comprehensive income. This change in future policy benefits assumes that the securities underlying certain traditional long-duration products are sold at their stated aggregate fair value and reinvested at current yields.    Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments     Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.  Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen.    Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities     The decline in net derivative gains in 2013 primarily reflects the de-designation of all derivatives receiving cash flow hedging treatment in 2012.    Change in Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment     The increases in retirement plan liabilities adjustment for the three- and six-months periods ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 were primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.    Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income     For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, the effective tax rates on pre-tax Other comprehensive loss were 34.4 percent and 36.0 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance and the effect of foreign operations.  For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, the effective tax rates on pre-tax Other comprehensive income were 33.5 percent and 31.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance and the effect of foreign operations.     138                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Liquidity and Capital Resources      Overview       Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Identification, and Measurement in the 2012 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.    Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We and our insurance subsidiaries must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM's stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both the AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.  Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or capital, or both. In addition, regulatory, and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.  Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders, share purchases and acquisitions.     139      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Liquidity and Capital Resources Management Highlights During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013   Sources  •AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries  During the first six months of 2013, we collected $792 million in cash dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and approximately $1.9 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.    •ALICO Escrow Release  On May 1, 2013, $547 million held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife under the ALICO stock purchase agreement was released to AIG.   Uses  •Debt Reduction  During the first six months of 2013, we repaid approximately $5.6 billion of debt as follows:  We redeemed $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures and $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.45% Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures, in each case, for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest.  We purchased, in cash tender offers, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.0 billion of our junior subordinated debentures, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.  We also made other repayments of approximately $2.7 billion, which include repayments by AIG Parent of $1.4 billion.    •Purchase of Warrants We paid approximately $25 million in the first quarter of 2013 to purchase warrants issued in 2008 and 2009 to the Department of the Treasury.

Excluding interest payments, we generated positive operating cash flow of $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion in the first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.  Cash used in operating activities of AIG Property Casualty was $0.4 billion for the first six months of 2013 compared to cash provided of $0.5 billion in the first six months of 2012, primarily reflecting the timing of the payments related to catastrophe losses.     141      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash provided by operating activities of AIG Life and Retirement was $0.9 billion for the first six months of 2013 compared to $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2012. These cash flows reflected operating performance that was generally consistent for AIG Life and Retirement in both periods.  Cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $1.4 billion for both the first six months of 2013 and 2012.    Investing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 includes approximately $1.3 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement.  Net cash provided by investing activities in the first six months of 2012 includes the following items:  •approximately $6.0 billion in gross proceeds from the sale of 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares;   •approximately $1.9 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement; and  •approximately $1.6 billion in distributions from the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II.    Financing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash used in financing activities for the first six months of 2013 includes:  •approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate to purchase, in cash tender offers, junior subordinated debentures we issued, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc;  •approximately $1.1 billion to redeem our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures; and   •approximately $750 million to redeem our 6.45% Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures.  Net cash used in financing activities during the first six months of 2012 includes:  •$8.6 billion pay down of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV preferred interests; and   •total payments of approximately $5.0 billion for the purchase of approximately 169 million shares of AIG Common Stock.      Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries       AIG Parent     As of June 30, 2013, AIG Parent had approximately $14.7 billion in liquidity resources. AIG Parent's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade, fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and tenor. During the first six months of 2013, upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchased publicly traded, intermediate term, investment grade, fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity resources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans, and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs.  AIG Parent's primary sources of capital include dividends and distributions from subsidiaries. AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries to facilitate the transfer of capital and liquidity within AIG. We expect     142      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  these CMAs to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and help manage the flow of capital between AIG Parent and these subsidiaries. We have entered into CMAs with certain other insurance subsidiaries in 2013. See AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty below for additional information. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:                      (In millions)       As of June 30, 2013            Cash and short-term investments(a)(b)       $   8,123        Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(c)           2,920              Total AIG Parent liquidity           11,043              Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(d)           3,127        Available capacity under contingent liquidity facility(e)           500              Total AIG Parent liquidity sources       $   14,670                (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2013.  (b) $5.4 billion of cash and short-term investments are allocated toward future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs of DIB and GCM as of June 30, 2013.  (c) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entities securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds.  (d) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see Credit Facilities below.  (e) For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facility, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.      143                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent   Sources During the first six months of 2013 we collected $792 million in cash dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and approximately $1.9 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.  On May 1, 2013, $547 million held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife under the ALICO stock purchase agreement was released to AIG.  Uses During the first six months of 2013, we:  •redeemed $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures and $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.45% Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures, in each case for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest;  •purchased, in cash tender offers:      •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1 billion, approximately 77 million British pounds aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures, approximately 182 million Euro aggregate principal amount of our 8.000% Series A-7 Junior Subordinated Debentures, approximately $79 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and approximately $366 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures;   •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $211 million, approximately $19 million liquidation amount of 81/2% Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities, approximately $114 million liquidation amount of 7.57% Capital Securities, Series A and approximately $29 million liquidation amount of 81/8% Capital Securities, Series B, all of which were issued by statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH; and   •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $61 million, approximately $62 million aggregate principal amount of 5.60% Senior Debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.;    •repaid $1.4 billion of debt, including $181 million of MIP long-term debt, and made interest payments totaling $1.1 billion; and  •paid approximately $25 million in the aggregate to purchase a warrant issued to the Department of the Treasury in 2008 that provided the right to purchase approximately 2.7 million shares of AIG Common Stock at $50.00 per share and a warrant issued to the Department of Treasury in 2009 that provided the right to purchase up to 150 shares of AIG Common Stock at $0.00002 per share.     AIG Property Casualty     We expect that AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries' liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade, fixed maturity securities. These securities are eligible to be pledged to a Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.  AIG Property Casualty paid $792 million in cash dividends to AIG Parent in the first six months of 2013.  AIG Parent could be required to provide additional funding to AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances, including:  •large catastrophes that may require AIG to provide additional support to our affected operations;     144      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   •downgrades in AIG's credit ratings that could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of AIG's subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations;  •increases in market interest rates that may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital; and  •other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain, including economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.  AIG Parent, AIG Property Casualty Inc. and certain AIG Property Casualty domestic insurance subsidiaries are parties to a consolidated CMA. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries, measured as a group (the Fleet), at or above the specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). In addition, the CMA provides that if the total adjusted capital of the Fleet exceeds that same specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's total authorized control level RBC, subject to approval by their respective boards, and compliance with applicable insurance laws, the AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce the Fleet's projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage. As of June 30, 2013, the specified minimum percentage was 325 percent.  For the first six months of 2013, cash dividends of approximately $480 million were paid pursuant to the CMA and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions pursuant to the CMA.  On May 17, 2013, Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington) purchased stock in the FHLB of Boston, thereby becoming a member of the FHLB of Boston. Additionally, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (NUFI) is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh and Chartis Specialty Insurance Company (CSI) is a member of the FHLB of Chicago. FHLB membership provides participants with access to various services, including access to low-cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage-backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets. These advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes. As of June 30, 2013, there were no FHLB advances outstanding for NUFI, CSI or Lexington.  On April 29 2013, we entered into a new $625 million Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) letter of credit facility, which replaced the prior $725 million ACNL letter of credit facility. Under the new facility, AIG Parent replaced AIG Property Casualty Inc. as a direct obligor. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd's), is required to hold capital at Lloyd's, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account, the entire FAL requirement of $564 million, as of April 29, 2013, was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility.    AIG Life and Retirement     We expect that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries' liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade, fixed maturity securities. These securities are eligible to be pledged to a FHLB in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.  In the first six months of 2013, AIG Life and Retirement provided $1.9 billion of liquidity to AIG Parent, which was funded by the payment of dividends from AIG Life and Retirement's insurance subsidiaries.  The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a significant potential liquidity requirement for AIG Life and Retirement's insurance subsidiaries. We believe that because of the size and liquidity of our investment portfolios, AIG Life and Retirement does not face a significant liquidity risk due to normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience. Furthermore, AIG Life and Retirement's products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of its risk management framework, AIG Life and Retirement continues to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve its liquidity     145      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  position and facilitate AIG Life and Retirement's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. AIG Life and Retirement also has developed a robust contingent liquidity plan to address any unforeseen liquidity needs.  AIG Life and Retirement executes programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from its investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to liquid investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that an AIG Life and Retirement insurance company may lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account admitted assets. AIG Life and Retirement's liability to the borrower for collateral received was $4.4 billion as of June 30, 2013. In addition, certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. As of June 30, 2013, AIG Life and Retirement had outstanding borrowings of $50 million from the FHLBs. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other general corporate purposes.  AIG Parent is party to CMAs with certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary's projected company action level RBC.  In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBC, subject to approval by their respective boards and compliance with applicable insurance laws, the subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage. As of June 30, 2013, the specified minimum percentage was 385 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage is 250 percent.  In the first six months of 2013, approximately $1.9 billion was distributed under the CMAs and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the CMAs.    Other Operations         Mortgage Guaranty     We expect that Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Mortgage Guaranty's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade, fixed maturity securities. These securities could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.  On July 1, 2013, AIG Parent entered into a CMA with a Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital.  As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum required capital is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 21 to 1.      Global Capital Markets     GCM acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. Commencing June 10, 2013, GCM is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to Dodd-Frank. To the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation, GCM is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing     146      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  organization and GCM's clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants. To the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation, these derivative trades are governed by bilateral master agreements, the form of which is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA). These agreements, primarily between GCM and third party financial institutions, require collateral postings. Many of GCM's transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements the purpose of which are to provide collateral to GCM, which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties, including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants. Most of GCM's CDS are subject to collateral posting provisions. The collateral posting provisions contained in the ISDA agreements and related transaction documents with respect to CDSs differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior CDSs is a function of our credit ratings, the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. We estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDS using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions.  As of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, GCM had total assets of $8.6 billion and $8.0 billion and total liabilities of $3.8 billion and $4.9 billion. GCM's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM's liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted by GCM to third parties was $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. GCM obtained collateral from third parties totaling $543 million and $846 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.      Direct Investment Book     The DIB is managed so that it maintains the liquidity that we believe is necessary to meet all of the DIB liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from AIG Parent. If the DIB's risk target is breached, we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB's liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.  The DIB's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities and, to a lesser extent, bank loans and mortgage loans. The DIB's liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short-term financing obligations. As of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, the DIB had total assets of $25.7 billion and $28.5 billion and total liabilities of $21.8 billion and $23.8 billion.  The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and are not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.  Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $4.3 billion at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.      Credit Facilities       We maintain a committed revolving four-year syndicated credit facility (the Four-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Four-Year Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit. We currently expect to replace or extend the Four-Year Facility on or prior to its expiration in October 2016, although no assurance can be given that the Four-Year Facility will be replaced on favorable terms or at all.  The Four-Year Facility provides for $4.0 billion of unsecured revolving loans, which includes a $2.0 billion letter of credit sublimit. As of June 30, 2013, a total of approximately $3.1 billion remains available under the Four-Year Facility, of which approximately $1.1 billion remains available for letters of credit. Our ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility     147      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Four-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Four-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.      Contingent Liquidity Facilities     AIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.  Our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.      Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                              Payments due by Period       June 30, 2013    (in millions)      Total Payments      Remainder of 2013      2014- 2015      2016- 2017      2018      Thereafter               Insurance operations                                            Loss reserves      $ 87,291     $ 22,559      $ 24,981     $ 12,897      $ 4,192     $ 22,662        Insurance and investment contract liabilities        230,869        8,388        25,655        24,930        11,622        160,274        Borrowings        1,621        6        46        8        3        1,558        Interest payments on borrowings        2,856        57        225        225        113        2,236        Other long-term obligations        26        4        12        7        3        –            Total      $ 322,663     $ 31,014      $ 50,919     $ 38,067      $ 15,933     $ 186,730             Other                                            Borrowings(a)     $ 62,426     $ 3,453      $ 11,638     $ 15,570      $ 9,945     $ 21,820        Interest payments on borrowings        38,284        1,678        6,460        5,109        1,779        23,258        Aircraft purchase commitments        22,328        895        5,117        7,432        4,381        4,503        Other long-term obligations        199        19        89        3        –        88            Total     $ 123,237     $ 6,045      $ 23,304     $ 28,114      $ 16,105     $ 49,669             Consolidated                                            Loss reserves      $ 87,291     $ 22,559      $ 24,981     $ 12,897      $ 4,192     $ 22,662        Insurance and investment contract liabilities        230,869        8,388        25,655        24,930        11,622        160,274        Borrowings(a)        64,047        3,459        11,684        15,578        9,948        23,378        Interest payments on borrowings        41,140        1,735        6,685        5,334        1,892        25,494        Aircraft purchase commitments        22,328        895        5,117        7,432        4,381        4,503        Other long-term obligations(b)        225        23        101        10        3        88            Total(c)     $ 445,900     $ 37,059      $ 74,223     $ 66,181      $ 32,038     $ 236,399            (a) Includes $23.3 billion of borrowings related to ILFC which is reported as discontinued operations.  (b) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.  (c) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.9 billion ($4.6 billion excluding ILFC), the timing of which is uncertain.      148                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities       Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to AIG Life and Retirement businesses. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of our control.  We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We believe that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.  Loss reserves relate to the AIG Property Casualty and the Mortgage Guaranty businesses, and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that AIG Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.      Borrowings     Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements.     149      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments     The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                              Amount of Commitment Expiring       June 30, 2013  (in millions)      Total Amounts Committed     Remainder of 2013      2014- 2015      2016- 2017      2018      Thereafter               Insurance operations                                            Guarantees:                                            Standby letters of credit     $ 1,063     $ 274     $ 148     $ 564     $ 77     $ –        Guarantees of indebtedness       185       –       –       –       –       185        All other guarantees(a)       15       –       7       1       –       7        Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(b)       1,881       1,514       268       99       –       –        Commitments to extend credit       523       427       96       –       –       –        Letters of credit       10       –       10       –       –       –        Other commercial commitments(c)       652       –       –       –       –       652            Total(e)     $ 4,329     $ 2,215     $ 529     $ 664     $ 77     $ 844             Other                                            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(d)     $ 101     $ –     $ –     $ –     $ –     $ 101        Standby letters of credit       306       298       6       2       –       –        All other guarantees(a)       384       –       186       71       31       96        Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(b)       459       322       39       26       –       72        Commitments to extend credit       103       100       3       –       –       –        Letters of credit       20       20       –       –       –       –        Other commercial commitments(c)       32       30       2       –       –       –            Total(e)(f)     $ 1,405     $ 770     $ 236     $ 99     $ 31     $ 269             Consolidated                                            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(d)     $ 101     $ –     $ –     $ –     $ –     $ 101        Standby letters of credit       1,369       572       154       566       77       –        Guarantees of indebtedness       185       –       –       –       –       185        All other guarantees(a)       399       –       193       72       31       103        Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(b)       2,340       1,836       307       125       –       72        Commitments to extend credit       626       527       99       –       –       –        Letters of credit       30       20       10       –       –       –        Other commercial commitments(c)       684       30       2       –       –       652            Total(e)(f)     $ 5,734     $ 2,985     $ 765     $ 763     $ 108     $ 1,113           (a) Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and AIG Life and Retirement construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations.  (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.  (c) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2013 is expected to be approximately $36 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.  (e) Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (f) Includes $337 million attributable to ILFC, which is reported as discontinued operations.     150      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities     While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, our involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturity securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. We consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    Indemnification Agreements     We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

(d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.      153      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.  We are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers". Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or require accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.  In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions, or to permit termination of the transactions. Such transactions could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of AIGFP's counterparties would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.  The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depend on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity, Capital and Credit in the 2012 Annual Report.    Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock     On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.10 per share, payable on September 26, 2013 to shareholders of record on September 12, 2013. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. The timing of such repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.  Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for additional discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG's subsidiaries.     154                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS       Investments      OVERVIEW     Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and AIG Parent including the DIB. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.      Market Conditions     Our investments and investment strategies were affected by the following conditions in the second quarter of 2013:  •The Federal Reserve's potential tapering of its quantitative easing bond purchase program led to a selloff in the bond market in June. Slowing growth in China and continued challenges in Europe added to the uncertainty in the bond market.  •Although June ended seven months of positive performance in the domestic equity markets, the second quarter performance was muted, at approximately 2 percent. U.S. equity markets reached record high levels during the quarter before retreating in the last half of June.   •Bond yields increased sharply during the second quarter of 2013, with the ten-year U.S. Treasury rates increasing 64 basis points to end the quarter at 2.49 percent. In addition, spreads on investment grade and high yield securities widened during the quarter.  •The performance of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies was mixed during the quarter as it strengthened 5 percent against the Yen, weakened 1 percent against the Euro, and was flat against the British Pound.      Investment Strategies     At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   •In the case of AIG Life and Retirement, as well as in the DIB, our fundamental investment strategy is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable.  •Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of AIG Property Casualty, cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  •Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  •AIG Parent's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade, fixed maturity securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and tenor. During the first half of 2013, upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchased publicly traded, intermediate term, investment grade fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.     155      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS      Investment Highlights     The following is an overview of investment activities during the second quarter of 2013:  •An increase in rates and widening of investment grade and high yields spreads resulted in net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available-for-sale portfolio declined to approximately $14 billion as of June 30, 2013 from approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2012 due to increases in interest rates and the realization of over $1.5 billion in gains.  •We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with attractive and appropriate risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.  •Net investment income benefited from higher returns on alternative investments primarily due to the performance of equity markets.  •Blended investment yields on new AIG Life and Retirement and AIG Property Casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  •Other-than-temporary-impairments remained at low levels, with a small portion attributable to structured securities.    Credit Ratings     At June 30, 2013, approximately 89 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.  A significant portion of our foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2013, approximately 16 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 3 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 49 percent of the foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us. For a further discussion of the NAIC designations of our fixed maturity securities, see NAIC Designations below.  See Enterprise Risk Management herein for a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments.     156      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  The following table presents the composite

AIG Property Casualty     In our property casualty business, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines. As differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies, the focus is not on asset-liability matching, but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus.  Fixed maturity securities of AIG Property Casualty domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.1 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.     158                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  Fixed maturity securities held in AIG Property Casualty foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration, averaging 4.2 years.  While invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in AIG Property Casualty domestic operations, a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds. These investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long-term returns over time.    AIG Life and Retirement     With respect to AIG Life and Retirement, we use asset-liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets. Our objective is to maintain a matched asset-liability structure, although we may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position. To the extent that we have maintained a matched asset-liability structure, the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated.  Our investment strategy for AIG Life and Retirement is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities. There exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in-force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.  AIG Life and Retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a low interest rate environment.  The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity.  A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products. The fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. We manage our exposure resulting from these long-term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. We actively review underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees. We have taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees. We execute listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products. We also enter into various types of futures and options contracts, primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates. We use several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure, including listed futures on government securities, listed options on government securities and the purchase of government securities.  With respect to over-the-counter derivatives, we deal with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. We have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. We generally use ISDA Master Agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.  Fixed maturity securities of AIG Life and Retirement, with an average duration of 6.2 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as municipal and government bonds, commercial mortgage loans, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on our composite ratings.      NAIC Designations     The SVO of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called 'NAIC Designations.' In general, NAIC Designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC     159      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  Designations for certain mortgaged-backed, asset-backed and collateralized securities are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third party engaged by the NAIC.  The following table presents the NAIC Designations of the fixed maturity securities in AIG Life and Retirement's fixed maturity security portfolio based on fair value:                              At June 30, 2013 (in millions)      Rating Agency Designation      Other Fixed Maturity Securities      Mortgage-Backed, Asset-Backed and Collateralized      Total               Investment grade:                              1   Aaa/Aa/A      $ 47,056     $ 36,873      $ 83,929        2   Baa        61,538        1,877        63,415            Subtotal            108,594        38,750        147,344             Below investment grade:                              3   Ba        4,054        817        4,871        4   B        2,018        444        2,462        5   Caa and Lower        463        427        890        6   In or near default        128        1,211        1,339            Subtotal            6,663        2,899        9,562            Total*         $ 115,257      $ 41,649     $ 156,906           * Excludes $369 million of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC rating is available because they are not held in legal entities within AIG Life and Retirement that require a statutory filing.

Based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.  The following tables present other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in earnings on fixed maturity securities, equity securities, private equity funds and hedge funds.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 related to:  •issuer-specific credit events;  •securities for which we have changed our intent from hold to sell;  •declines due to foreign exchange rates;  •adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities;  •securities that experienced severe market valuation declines; and •other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts.     169                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  There was no significant impact to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations from other-than-temporary impairment charges for any one single credit. Also, no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.01 percent and 0.10 percent of total equity at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $222 million and $231 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $427 million and $453 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.   For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $11.3 billion primarily due to the increase in interest rates for investment grade fixed maturity securities, which more than offset the narrowing of credit spreads for high yield securities.

We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.                  OVERVIEW     We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm's major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses.    For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management in the 2012 Annual Report.       Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)    •    Our ERM framework provides senior management with a consolidated view of our risk appetite and major risk positions.   •    In each of our business units, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the ERM framework while working with ERM to mitigate risks across the firm.  •    Risk management is an integral part of how we manage our core businesses.         Credit Risk Management         Overview     Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of counterparty's credit ratings.  We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from fixed maturity investments, equity securities, deposits, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit accepted as collateral.  Our credit risks are managed at the corporate level within ERM. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by seasoned credit officers in all the business units, whose primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of credit risk policies and procedures.  Responsibilities of the CCO and credit executives include:  •developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies;  •approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives;     171      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT   •managing the approval process for requests for credit limits, program limits and credit transactions above authorities or where concentrations of risk may exist or be incurred;  •aggregating globally all credit exposure data by counterparty, country, sector and industry and reporting risk concentrations regularly to and reviewing with senior management;  •administering regular portfolio credit reviews of investment, derivative and credit-incurring business units and recommending corrective actions where required;  •conducting credit research on countries, sectors and asset classes where risk concentrations may exist;   •developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process; and  •approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies in all credit portfolios.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as cash, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We identify our aggregate credit exposures to our underlying counterparty risks.      Largest Credit Concentrations     Our single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 25 percent of Total equity at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Exposure to the U.S. Government primarily includes credit exposure related to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and to direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) based upon their U.S. Government conservatorship. Based on our internal risk ratings, at June 30, 2013, our largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure, apart from ILFC leasing arrangements secured by aircraft with airlines having below investment grade ratings, was related to a non-financial corporate counterparty. That exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.      Government Credit Concentrations (non-U.S.)     Our total direct and guaranteed credit exposure to non-U.S. governments is $21.1 billion at June 30, 2013, compared to $23.7 billion in December 31, 2012. Our single largest concentration in this sector was to the government of Japan in the amount of $6.5 billion at June 30, 2013. Most of these securities were held in the investment portfolios of our Japanese insurance operations and are yen denominated.     172      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  The following table presents our aggregate credit exposures to non-U.S. governments and their agencies, dependent state-owned enterprises, financial institutions and local governments:                                       (in millions)       June 30, 2013      December 31, 2012*            Japan         $   6,454    $ 8,109      Canada           2,629      2,718      Germany           1,293      1,446      France            1,119      1,207      China           936      926      Brazil           733      601      South Korea            696      693      Singapore           635      631      United Kingdom           620      816      Mexico            511      552      Other           5,513      6,032          Total         $   21,139    $ 23,731            * The prior period has been changed to reflect the inclusion of Brazil and the exclusion of Australia.       Financial Institution Concentrations     Our single largest industry credit exposure at June 30, 2013 was to the global financial institutions sector as a whole, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of June 30, 2013, credit exposure to this sector was $79.1 billion, or 81 percent of Total equity compared to 87 percent at December 31, 2012.  At June 30, 2013:  •$74.8 billion, or 95 percent, of these global financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings.  •$4.3 billion, or 5 percent, were considered non-investment grade based on our internal ratings. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade-rated financial institutions was $1.9 billion.  •Our aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $32.6 billion.  •Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $14.0 billion, or 18 percent of the total global financial institution credit exposure.  •The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, and captive fronting risk management programs for these financial institutions.      European Concentrations       We actively monitor our European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the Euro-Zone periphery. We use various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine the need for mitigating actions. As a mitigating action, we typically decide not to renew maturing exposures or, when the opportunity presents itself, to sell or to tender securities. To date, we have not actively used credit default protection. We periodically evaluate the financial condition of issuers and adjust internal risk ratings as warranted.  The result of these continuing reviews has led us to believe that our combined credit risk exposures in the Euro-Zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers.     173      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  The following table presents our aggregate United Kingdom and European credit exposures (excluding ILFC) by major sector:                                                      June 30, 2013            (in millions)      Sovereign      Financial Institution      Non- Financial Corporates      Structured Products/ Other(a)      Total      December 31, 2012 Total            Euro-Zone countries:                                                              France         $   1,119           $   2,464           $   7,118           $   173           $   10,874    $ 10,533      Germany           1,293             4,089              3,886             133             9,401      9,248      Netherlands           235             4,218             2,240              1,645             8,338      8,333      Spain            155             666             2,303             208              3,332      4,067      Italy           90             343              1,908             217             2,558      2,848      Belgium           146             199             854              –             1,199      1,174      Ireland            –             97             996             –              1,093      1,018      Luxembourg           –             21              616             33             670      666      Austria           141             152             206              –             499      523      Finland            127             32             299             –              458      432      Other Euro-Zone           30             19              180             11             240      306          Total Euro-Zone         $   3,336           $   12,300           $   20,606           $   2,420           $   38,662    $ 39,148          Remainder of Europe                                                               United Kingdom       $   620         $   8,410         $   15,676         $   4,693         $   29,399    $ 30,372      Switzerland            70             5,135             2,845             –              8,050      7,290      Sweden           112             2,517              511             –             3,140      3,643      Other remainder of Europe           1,007             914             2,375              955             5,251      5,612          Total remainder of Europe       $   1,809         $   16,976         $   21,407         $   5,648         $   45,840    $ 46,917          Total         $   5,145           $   29,276           $   42,013           $   8,068           $   84,502    $ 86,065            (a) Other represents mortgage guaranty insurance risk-in-force ($411 million), primarily in Italy ($169 million) and Spain ($109 million).   Aggregate credit exposure to European governments totaled $5.1 billion at June 30, 2013, compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Many of the European governments' ratings have been downgraded by one or more of the major rating agencies, occurring mostly in countries in the Euro-Zone periphery where our government credit exposures (Spain, Italy and Portugal) totaled $248 million at June 30, 2013. The downgrades primarily reflect continued recessionary conditions, large government budget deficits, rising government debt-to-GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these countries. These credit exposures primarily included available-for-sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. At June 30, 2013, we had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece, Ireland, Cyprus or Slovenia.  Our exposure to European financial institutions at June 30, 2013 included $17.4 billion of credit exposures to European banks, of which $16.3 billion were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade rated credit exposures to European banks were $1.1 billion. Our credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $7.5 billion at June 30, 2013, of which $4.4 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $977 million, of which $729 million were fixed maturity securities. These credit exposures were primarily to the largest banks in Spain and Italy. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2013, of which $850 million were fixed maturity securities. Our credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.  In addition, our exposure at June 30, 2013 to European financial institutions included $11.8 billion of aggregate credit exposure to non-bank institutions, mostly insurers and reinsurers, with $9.3 billion, or 79 percent, of credit exposure representing reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. At June 30, 2013, $1.5 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non-banks was fixed maturity securities, of which 96 percent were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings.     174      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  Of the $20.6 billion of non-financial institution corporate exposure to Euro-Zone countries at June 30, 2013, 95 percent was to fixed maturity securities ($11.2 billion) and insurance-related products ($8.4 billion), with the majority of the insurance exposures being trade credit insurance ($3.3 billion), captive fronting programs ($3.1 billion), and surety bonds ($1.4 billion). Our exposure to France of $7.1 billion at June 30, 2013 represented the largest single non-financial corporate country exposure within the Euro-Zone, of which $2.7 billion were fixed maturity securities. Approximately two-thirds of the French exposures were to issuers in the utilities, oil and gas, and telecommunications industries. Euro-Zone periphery non-financial institution corporate exposures ($5.4 billion) at June 30, 2013 were heavily weighted towards large multinational corporations or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (22 percent), telecommunications (15 percent), and oil and gas (9 percent).  Of the $7.7 billion at June 30, 2013 of United Kingdom and European structured product exposures (largely consisting of residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities), United Kingdom structured products accounted for 72 percent, while the Netherlands and Germany comprised 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the Euro-Zone periphery accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 78 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at June 30, 2013 based on external rating agency ratings.  In addition, we had commercial real estate related net equity investments in Europe totaling $420 million and related unfunded commitments of $88 million at June 30, 2013.

(d) Other primarily consists of derivative transactions reported at fair value.      175                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  At June 30, 2013, approximately 90 percent of fixed maturity securities in the United Kingdom and European exposures were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings. European financial institution fixed maturity securities exposure was $9.8 billion, of which $1.0 billion were covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and that have full recourse to the issuing bank). During the second quarter of 2013, $4.4 billion of fixed maturity securities were issued by banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries. Our subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $828 million and $300 million, respectively, at June 30, 2013. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.      Other Credit Concentrations     We have a risk concentration in the U.S. municipal sector, primarily through the investment portfolios of our insurance companies. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of our domestic property and casualty insurance companies. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. We had $385 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of our insurance company portfolios at June 30, 2013, compared to $464 million at December 31, 2012. These exposures consisted of derivatives and trading securities (at fair value), and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.  We have a risk concentration in the residential mortgage sector in the form of non-agency RMBS, CDO of RMBS as well as our mortgage guaranty insurance business. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details on RMBS and CDO investments. The net risk-in-force for UGC was $35.6 billion at June 30, 2013, of which exposure in the United States was $33.6 billion. At June 30, 2013, UGC had no concentration of exposure in any one state that exceeded 10 percent of UGC's total United States exposure.  We also have a risk concentration in the commercial real estate sector in the form of non-agency CMBS, CDO and CMBS as well as commercial mortgage whole loans and equity investments in commercial real estate. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments and Investments — Commercial Mortgage Loans herein for further details.  We also monitor our aggregate cross-border exposures by country and region. Cross-border exposure is defined as an underlying risk that is taken within a country or jurisdiction other than the country or jurisdiction in which an AIG business unit taking the risk is domiciled. These cross-border exposures include both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and cross-border investments in our own international subsidiaries. Five countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Based on our internal risk ratings, at June 30, 2013, three countries were rated AAA and two were rated AA. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and Bermuda.  We regularly review concentration reports in the categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. We periodically adjust limits and review exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that we do not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that our credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.      Market Risk Management     Market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity and commodity prices, and their levels of volatility. Market risk includes credit spread risk, the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in credit spreads of securities or counterparties.  We are exposed to market risks, primarily within our insurance businesses and GCM. In our insurance operations, market risk results primarily from potential mismatches in our asset-liability exposures, rather than speculative positioning. Specifically, our life insurance and retirement businesses collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long-term, fixed maturity securities. We earn a spread between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders. We manage the business so that the cash flows from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due, without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market. In periods of severe market volatility, depressed and illiquid fair values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders' equity even without actual credit event related losses.     176      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  Our market exposures can be categorized as follows:  •  Benchmark interest rates. Benchmark interest rates are also known as risk-free interest rates and are associated with either the government/treasury yield curve or the swap curve. The fair value of our significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change.  •  Credit spread or risk premium. Credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument.  •  Equity and alternative investment prices. We are exposed to equity and alternative investment prices affecting a variety of instruments. These include direct investments in common stock and mutual funds, minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and other equity-like investments, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, private equity investments, commercial real estate and real estate funds. •  Foreign currency exchange rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies.       We use a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify our market risk exposure, including:   •   Duration/key rate duration. Duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed-income instrument to the changes in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve.  •  Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets.  •  Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of RMBS or CMBS during 2008. •  VaR. Value at Risk (VaR) is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors, and a management-determined level of confidence, to estimate how frequently a portfolio of risk exposures could be expected to lose at least a specified amount. As an example, Federal Reserve's Market Risk Measure specifies a VaR based approach to calculate market risk equivalent assets for capital ratio calculations.

Total yield-sensitive assets decreased 4.9 percent or     177      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  approximately $15.1 billion, compared to December 31, 2012, primarily due to a net decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of $12.3 billion, and a decrease in cash equivalents of $2.8 billion.  Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stock, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds, but exclude consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds. Total exposure in these areas increased 0.5 percent, or approximately $123 million, compared to December 31, 2012, primarily due to an increase of $239 million related to alternative investments and an increase in common equity securities of $37 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other equity investments of $59 million, a decrease in real estate investments of $57 million and decrease in mutual fund value of $37 million.  Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect our consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis. Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 6.2 percent, or $563 million, compared to December 31, 2012. This was primarily due to an increase in Hong Kong dollar exposure of $592 million resulting from AIG Life and Retirement's investment in PICC Group, an increase in Euro exposure of $101 million resulting from a reduction in Euro-denominated debt outstanding and a net increase across other currencies of $259 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in Euro exposure of $202 million at AIG Europe Limited, a decrease in British Pound exposure of $108 million resulting from British Pound exchange rate decreasing and a decrease in Canadian Dollar exposure of $108 million resulting from a dividend payment from Chartis Insurance Company of Canada.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. This should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.      Liquidity Risk Management     Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations.  The failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, and reputational harm. Because liquidity is critically important, our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address both AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.  Sources of Liquidity risk can include, but are not limited to:  •financial market movements — significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies. Changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions, inadequate market depth, or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets;  •potential reputational events or credit downgrade — changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements; and  •catastrophic events, including natural and man-made disasters, that can increase policyholder claims.  The principal objective of ERM's liquidity risk framework is to protect AIG's liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods.    We defined our risk appetite to include a liquidity target. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a two-year time horizon designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine the appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.  Additionally, each business unit is responsible for managing liquidity within a framework designed for the measurement and monitoring of liquidity risks inherent in that business. Current cash and liquidity positions are reviewed for changes and against minimum liquidity levels. Future cash inflows and outflows are tracked through cash flow forecasting. If the business unit projects a breach of the minimum liquidity levels, the amount of required liquidity resources will be identified and we will determine any actions to be taken. Business unit level key indicators are assessed to provide advance warning of potential liquidity risks.     178                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.        The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:    •classification of ILFC as held for sale;  •insurance liabilities, including property casualty and mortgage guaranty unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;  •income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;  •recoverability of assets including reinsurance assets;  •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;  •other-than-temporary impairments of financial instruments;  •liabilities for legal contingencies; and •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.   See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. The following discussion updates critical accounting estimates included in the 2012 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, you should read this section in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2012 Annual Report.      Classification of ILFC as Held for Sale     We report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months, which may require significant judgment, and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized.  On December 9, 2012, American International Group, Inc. (AIG Parent), AIG Capital Corporation (Seller), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of AIG Parent and the sole shareholder of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), and Jumbo Acquisition Limited (Purchaser) entered into a definitive agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) for the sale of 80.1 percent of the common stock of ILFC for approximately $4.2 billion in cash (the ILFC Transaction). The Share Purchase Agreement permits the Purchaser to elect to purchase an additional 9.9 percent of the common stock of ILFC for $522.5 million (the Option). On June 15, 2013, AIG, Seller and Purchaser entered into an amendment (the Amendment) to the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated May 10, 2013. The Amendment extended to July 31, 2013, the date on which any of AIG Parent, Seller or Purchaser may terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended, if the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not yet occurred. Under the Amendment, AIG Parent and Seller may pursue (but not enter into definitive documentation for, or     179      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  consummate) other offers for ILFC and may continue to pursue (but not engage in widespread solicitation of orders for, or request effectiveness of) the alternative of a public offering.  On July 15, 2013, the Purchaser delivered notice that it intended to exercise the Option, raising the size of the total purchase to 90 percent of the common stock of ILFC.  As of August 5, 2013, the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not occurred. AIG continues to consider ILFC as a non-core business and is continuing to pursue other options including a sale or initial public offering. We determined ILFC met the criteria for held for sale and discontinued operations accounting at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.      Recoverability of Net Deferred Tax Asset     The evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.  We consider a number of factors in order to reliably estimate future taxable income, so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses (NOLs), foreign tax credits (FTCs) and nonlife capital loss carryforwards. These factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG-specific conditions and events. We also subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. We also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies and stress scenarios, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes (other than life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards) prior to their expiration.  Our ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards in AIG Life and Retirement depends, in part, on our ability to sell fixed maturity securities in a gain position. Changes in market conditions, including interest rates rising in excess of our projections, may result in a reduction in projected taxable gains and reestablishment of a valuation allowance.  See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax asset.      Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities     See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and AIG's accounting policy regarding the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.  The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                         June 30, 2013 (in billions)      Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 270     93 %    Fair value based on internal sources     19     7          Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 289     100 %            (a) Includes $25 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.     Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs     180      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  The following table presents the amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3:                                                (in billions)       June 30, 2013      Percentage of Total      December 31, 2012      Percentage of Total            Assets         $   45.4             8.4    %  $ 40.5     7.4 %    Liabilities           3.0             0.7       4.1     0.9           Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. We consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.  We classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.  The following paragraphs describe the methods we use to measure fair value on a recurring basis for super senior credit default swaps classified in Level 3. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for other assets classified in Level 3, including certain fixed maturity securities and certain other invested assets, and Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein for a discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.      Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio     The entities included in GCM wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt and prime residential mortgages through 2006. In these transactions, AIG is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets.  See Notes 5 and 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Regulatory Capital, Multi-Sector CDO, Corporate Debt/CLO and other portfolios.  AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on our calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio. For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Of the total $3.6 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at June 30, 2013, a BET value is available for $2.4 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.2 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $2.4 billion.     181      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at June 30, 2013 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                     Average               Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability       (dollars in millions)      Inputs Used at June 30, 2013      Change           Entire Portfolio           RMBS Prime      RMBS Alt-A      RMBS Subprime      CMBS      CDOs      Other            Bond prices   46 points   Increase of 5 points        $ (125 )      $ (2 ) $ (7 ) $ (58 ) $ (39 ) $ (10 ) $ (9 )           Decrease of 5 points          125          2     7     53     41     9     13           Weighted       Increase of 1 year          9          –     –     6     3     –     –      average life   5.99 years   Decrease of 1 year          (14 )        –     –     (9 )   (4 )   –     (1 )          Recovery rates   17%   Increase of 10%          (11 )        –     (2 )   (5 )   (2 )   (2 )   –             Decrease of 10%          14          –     1     8     3     1     1           Diversity score(a)   14   Increase of 5          (5 )                                                    Decrease of 5          8                                                    Discount curve(b)   N/A   Increase of 100bps          3                                                      (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.  In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business — Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation, Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulation and Supervision and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report.      Federal Reserve Supervision     On July 8, 2013, AIG received notice from the U.S. Treasury that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) has made a final determination that AIG should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). As a SIFI, we will be regulated by the FRB both in that capacity and, for as long as AIG continues to control an insured depository institution, in our capacity as a savings and loan holding company (SLHC). The regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other. We will also be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including heightened prudential standards. For a description of those standards as currently proposed and a discussion of the potential effects on us as a SIFI, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Regulation.      Other Regulatory Developments     As described below, AIG has been designated as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII).  In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly SIFIs, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). IAIS's ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries' financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority.  The FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS has provided its assessment template to the FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national     183      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  authorities, identified an initial list of Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs), which includes AIG. As a G-SII, AIG will be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision and higher loss absorbency capital requirements. It is expected that the G-SII policy framework will be fully implemented by 2019.  The IAIS is also developing a ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. As currently delineated under the ComFrame, AIG meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. While we currently do not know when any ComFrame directives will be finalized and become effective, the IAIS will undertake a field testing of the ComFrame, including the possibility of additional capital requirements for IAIGs, which is expected to commence in the latter part of 2013. It is expected that the ComFrame would be fully implemented by 2018.  Legislation in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective in 2016, reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we, along with other insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.  We expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.     184                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / GLOSSARY      GLOSSARY Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.  Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $10 million each.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting, and the change in deferred acquisition costs. Acquisition costs that are incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are deferred and recognized over the coverage periods of related insurance contracts. Acquisition costs that are not incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are recognized as incurred.  AIG — After-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses, income from divested businesses, legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments, legal reserves (settlements) related to "legacy crisis matters," deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges, changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital (gains) losses, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses, and bargain purchase gain. "Legacy crisis matters" include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.  AIG Life and Retirement — Operating income (loss) Operating income (loss) is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss): legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters, changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), net realized capital (gains) losses, and changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital (gains) losses.  AIG Life and Retirement — Premiums and deposits includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts, guaranteed investments contracts and mutual funds.  AIG Property Casualty — Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as Unearned premium reserves in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  AIG Property Casualty — Operating income (loss) includes both underwriting income (loss) and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital (gains) losses, other (income) expense, legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters and bargain purchase gain. Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expense, acquisition expense and general operating expense.   BET Binomial Expansion Technique A model that generates expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derives a credit rating for those tranches.  Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) (AOCI) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding.     185      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / GLOSSARY   Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result.

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Enterprise Risk Management.     ITEM 4. / CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2013.  There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.     189                Table of Contents       PART II — OTHER INFORMATION       ITEM 1 / LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.     ITEM 1A. / RISK FACTORS     In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed throughout Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.      REGULATION     Our status as a savings and loan holding company and a systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years.  We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect our businesses, results of operations or cash flows, or require us to raise additional capital.  We are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and subject to its examination, supervision and enforcement authority and reporting requirements as a saving and loan holding company (SLHC) and as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI).  As a result of our regulation by the FRB as an SLHC:  •The FRB exercises general supervisory authority over us.  •The FRB, as a prudential matter, may limit our ability to pay dividends and purchase shares of AIG Common Stock.   •The FRB is required to impose minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on us that are not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions.  The FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have established revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to bank holding companies and SLHCs, as well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. The final rules do not apply to SLHCs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activities. The Federal Reserve expects to implement a capital framework for SLHCs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activities by the time covered SLHCs must comply with the final rule in 2015.  On July 8, 2013, we received notice from the Department of the Treasury that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) has made a final determination that we should be supervised by the FRB as a SIFI pursuant to Dodd-Frank. As a SIFI, we are subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB and will be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including heightened prudential standards, some of which have been proposed but are not yet adopted in final form. As a SIFI, we anticipate we will be subject to:  •stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions;     190      Table of Contents  •stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress; and  •an early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.  Furthermore, if the Council were to make an additional separate determination that AIG poses a "grave threat" to U.S. financial stability, we would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1 and the FRB may:  •limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;   •restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;  •require us to terminate specified activities;  •impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; and  •with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.  In addition, the regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other.  Further, if we continue to control AIG Federal Savings Bank or another insured depository institution, as of July 21, 2014, we will be required to conform to the "Volcker Rule", which prohibits "proprietary trading" and the sponsoring or investing in "covered funds". The term "covered funds" includes hedge, private equity or similar funds and, in certain cases, issuers of asset backed securities if such securities have equity-like characteristics. These prohibitions could have a substantial impact on our investment portfolios as they are currently managed. Even if we no longer controlled an insured depository institution, Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to additional capital and quantitative limitations if they engage in activities prohibited for depository institutions by the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, as proposed, contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account, but the final breadth and scope of this exemption cannot be predicted.  In addition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for the regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which may significantly alter the cost, type and breadth of obligations associated with derivatives transactions, procedures for the pricing, documenting, monitoring and reporting of swaps, and the general conduct of hedging activities that are subject to its provisions. The scope of this new framework is continuing to be developed pursuant to ongoing rulemaking by both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC, and its aggregate effect on us is difficult to fully ascertain at this time. Both the CFTC and the SEC have proposed additional rules requiring the posting of collateral for swaps and security-based swaps not subject to clearing, among other requirements. Proposed rules may increase the cost of conducting a hedging program or have other effects materially adverse to us.  We cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank and our regulation by the FRB as an SLHC or as a SIFI could significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome and costly requirements and additional costs. Some of the regulations may also affect the perceptions of regulators, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our financial strength and could potentially affect our financing costs.  See Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Regulatory Environment for further discussion of these potential regulations.     ITEM 4 / MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES     Not applicable.     191      Table of Contents    ITEM 5 / OTHER INFORMATION     On December 9, 2012, American International Group, Inc. (AIG Parent), AIG Capital Corporation (Seller), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of AIG Parent and the sole shareholder of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), and Jumbo Acquisition Limited (Purchaser) entered into a definitive agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) for the sale of 80.1 percent of the common stock of ILFC for approximately $4.2 billion in cash (the ILFC Transaction). The Share Purchase Agreement permits the Purchaser to elect to purchase an additional 9.9 percent of the common stock of ILFC for $522.5 million (the Option). On June 15, 2013, AIG, Seller and Purchaser entered into an amendment (the Amendment) to the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated May 10, 2013. The Amendment extended to July 31, 2013, the date on which any of AIG Parent, Seller or Purchaser may terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended, if the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not yet occurred. Under the Amendment, AIG Parent and Seller may pursue (but not enter into definitive documentation for, or consummate) other offers for ILFC and may continue to pursue (but not engage in widespread solicitation of orders for, or request effectiveness of) the alternative of a public offering.  On July 15, 2013, the Purchaser delivered notice that it intended to exercise the Option, raising the size of the total purchase to 90 percent of the common stock of ILFC.  As of August 5, 2013, the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not occurred.     ITEM 6 / EXHIBITS
