Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.” The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book Value Per Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets represent U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. Amounts are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA are used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets represent U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. Amounts are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI and DTA. The reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A on a consolidated basis.     75       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income attributable to AIG:    • deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges; • changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense); • changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; • other income and expense — net, related to Corporate and Other run-off insurance lines; • loss on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • non‑qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital gains and losses;   • income or loss from discontinued operations; • income and loss from divested businesses, including:  • gain on the sale of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC); and • certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and related tax effects; • legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; • reserve development related to non-operating run-off insurance business; and • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization.       We use the following operating performance measures within our Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reportable segments as well as Corporate and Other. · Commercial Insurance: Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty; Consumer Insurance: Personal Insurance · Pre‑tax operating income: includes both underwriting income and loss and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital gains and losses, other income and expense — net, and non-operating litigation reserves and settlements. Underwriting income and loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses. · Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. · Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each.     76       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      · Commercial Insurance: Institutional Markets; Consumer Insurance: Retirement and Life • Pre‑tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income:     • changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense);   • changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; and     • net realized capital gains and losses;   • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements.    · Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts and mutual funds. · Corporate and Other — Pre‑tax operating income and loss is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income and loss:    • loss on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; • income and loss from divested businesses, including Aircraft Leasing;   • net gain or loss on sale of divested businesses, including: · gain on the sale of ILFC; and  · certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and our share of AerCap’s income taxes;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;  • reserve development related to non-operating run-off insurance business; and • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization.    Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.      77       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW          EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG’s securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, together with the 2014 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.  We report our results of operations as follows: · Commercial Insurance – Commercial Insurance offers insurance products and services to commercial and institutional customers worldwide. Commercial Insurance product lines include Casualty, Property, Specialty, Financial, Mortgage Insurance and Institutional Markets. Commercial Insurance products are distributed through a diversified multichannel distribution network that includes independent insurance brokers, banks, mortgage lenders, specialized marketing and consulting firms.  · Consumer Insurance – Consumer Insurance offers a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and property casualty products and services to individuals and groups. Consumer Insurance products include term life, whole life, universal life, accident & health (A&H), variable and index annuities, fixed annuities, group retirement plans, mutual funds, financial planning, automobile and homeowners insurance, travel insurance, and warranty and service programs. Consumer Insurance offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes broker-dealers, agencies and independent marketing organizations, banks, brokers, partnerships, travel agents, affiliated agents and financial advisors, and direct-to-consumer platforms.  · Corporate and Other – Corporate and Other consists of income from assets held by AIG Parent and other corporate subsidiaries, general operating expenses not attributable to specific reportable segments and interest expense. It also includes run-off lines of insurance business, including excess workers’ compensation, asbestos and legacy environmental (1986 and prior), certain environmental liability businesses, certain healthcare coverage, and certain long-duration business, primarily in Japan and the U.S.   As a result of the progress of the wind down and de-risking activities of the Direct Investment book (DIB) and the derivative portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and related subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) included within Global Capital Markets (GCM), AIG has discontinued separate reporting of the DIB and GCM. Their results are reported within Income from other assets, net, beginning with the first quarter of 2015. This reporting aligns with the manner in which AIG manages its financial resources. Prior periods are presented in the historical format for informational purposes. AIG borrowings supported by assets continue to be managed as such with assets allocated to support the timely repayment of those liabilities. Assets previously held in the DIB and GCM that are otherwise not required to meet the obligations and capital requirements of the DIB and GCM have been made available to AIG Parent.   As part of our broad and on-going efforts to transform AIG for long-term competitiveness, during the quarter we finalized a series of initiatives that will focus on organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization which are expected to generate pre-tax annualized savings of approximately $0.4 billion to $0.5 billion when fully implemented. These initiatives are expected to result in pre-tax restructuring and other costs of approximately $0.5 billion including approximately $0.3 billion of employee severance and one-time termination benefits, concentrated initially among management’s senior levels. Further staff reductions are anticipated in 2016. Approximately half of the remaining $0.2 billion relates to costs associated with modernization of information technology platforms, with the balance relating to costs associated with consolidation of legal entities and exiting lower return lines of business. Results for the third quarter of 2015 include approximately $274 million of pre-tax restructuring and other costs, with the remainder expected to be recognized through 2017. We expect approximately $0.3 billion of the aggregate pre-tax costs to result in cash expenditures. We will continue to evaluate lines of business, market segments and geographies within our Commercial and Consumer Insurance businesses. As decisions are made to exit lines of business, we expect to report their operating results within “Run-     78       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      off insurance lines” as a component of Corporate and Other, and prior periods’ presentation may be revised to conform to the new structure.   Executive Summary Financial Performance         Commercial Insurance pre‑tax operating income decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower net investment income in Property Casualty and Institutional Markets, which was primarily due to lower alternative investment income performance.  Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting lower net investment income, primarily due to alternative investment income performance, and less favorable adjustments to reflect an update of actuarial assumptions compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by higher policy and advisory fees in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by growth in separate account assets under management in Retirement. Pre-tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the same factors as the three-month period, as well as lower base net investment income and less favorable mortality experience in Life. Our investment portfolio performance declined in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to hedge fund performance, lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected, and lower reinvestment yields. Net realized capital gains decreased, with net losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to net gains in the same period in the prior year, due to lower realized capital gains from sales of investments, an increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges, and foreign exchange transaction losses compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in the prior year. Net realized capital gains increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to higher realized capital gains from sales of equity securities and fair value gains on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges, compared to fair value losses in the same period in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges.     79       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Our Performance – Selected Indicators

Investment Highlights         Net investment income decreased to $3.2 billion and $10.9 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to $4.0 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to hedge fund performance, lower income on assets for which the fair value option was elected, and lower reinvestment yields. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities, mortgage loans and other fixed income investments with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $13.0 billion as of September 30, 2015, from approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to a widening of credit spreads. The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity securities portfolio remains largely unchanged from December 31, 2014. Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights         We reduced our debt by $498 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of maturities, repayments and repurchases of $8.5 billion, offset in part by new debt issuances of $6.5 billion.     83       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      We maintained financial flexibility at AIG Parent in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 through $2.7 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $4.6 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies. The dividends that AIG Parent received in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 included $2.8 billion of dividends that were declared during the fourth quarter of 2014. Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), by an additional $5.0 billion on August 3, 2015. As of October 31, 2015, approximately $2.9 billion remained under our repurchase authorization. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased approximately 129 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.5 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 3.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in January 2015 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 plan, from October 1 to October 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $602 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.  We paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share on each of March 26, 2015 and June 25, 2015, and $0.28 per share on September 28, 2015. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on November 2, 2015 of $0.28 per share, payable on December 21, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 7, 2015. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $4.2 billion in the aggregate from the sale of approximately 97.6 million ordinary shares of AerCap in June and September 2015. Strategic Outlook Industry Trends         Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2015, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global equity markets and slowing growth in emerging markets, China and Euro-Zone economies.  Interest rates remain low relative to historical levels, which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns and unfavorably affecting loss reserve discounting, primarily related to our workers’ compensation reserves. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines. Currency volatility in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 was particularly acute compared to the same periods in the prior year, as the three major foreign currencies that we transact in weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate throughout the year, in either direction, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability. See Results of Operations – Foreign Currency Impact; Results of Operations – Segment Results – Quarterly and Year-to-date Pre-Tax Income Comparison for 2015 and 2014; Results of Operations – Commercial Insurance – Property Casualty Net      84       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Premiums Written by Region; and Results of Operations – Consumer Insurance – Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region.    AIG Priorities for 2015 and Beyond     AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2015 and beyond: · Improve our focus on our customers to understand their challenges and to help solve their problems; · Simplify our operations, which will lead to quicker, better decisions; bring us closer to our customers; and reduce costs;  · Improve our technology infrastructure to better serve customers and distribution partners, increase productivity, reduce expenses, and better position ourselves against our competitors; and · Concentrate on activities that increase our intrinsic value and sustainable profitability.     Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2015 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2014 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.  COMMERCIAL INSURANCE Strategic initiatives and Outlook              Executive Overview     Customer —  Aspire to be our customers’ most valued insurer by offering innovative products, excellent service and access to an extensive global network. Strategic Growth — Grow our higher-value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities. Underwriting Excellence — Improve our business portfolio through better pricing and risk selection by using enhanced data, analytics and the application of science to deliver superior risk adjusted returns.  Claims Excellence — Improve claims processes, analytics and tools to deliver superior customer service and decrease our loss ratio. Operational Effectiveness — Continue initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure; implement best practices to improve speed and quality of service. Capital Efficiency — Increase capital fungibility and diversification, streamline our legal entity structure, optimize reinsurance and improve tax efficiency.  Investment Strategy — Increase asset diversification and take advantage of yield enhancement opportunities to meet our capital, liquidity, risk and return objectives.          85       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Commercial Insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels, currency volatility, and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge growth of net investment income and limit growth and profitability in some markets. Due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, Commercial Insurance has continued to diversify its business focusing on growing profitable segments and geographies, exiting unprofitable lines and developing advanced data and analytics to improve profitability. Property Casualty         Property Casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. In the first half of 2015, the property casualty insurance industry experienced modest growth and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets, although this growth may be leveling off. Property Casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions. As a result of its ongoing strategy to optimize its portfolio and maintain underwriting discipline, Property Casualty expects that net premiums written for the U.S. Casualty line will continue to decline through 2016. Overall, Property Casualty experienced a modest increase in rate pressure in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Property Casualty expects that trend to continue in the near term, particularly in certain lines including in the U.S. Property Excess and Surplus market. Property Casualty continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint, diverse product offering, risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience. In the U.S., Property Casualty’s exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. For additional information on TRIA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reserves and Exposures and Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks — Terrorism Risk in our 2014 Annual Report. Mortgage Guaranty         During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the U.S. market experienced an increase in mortgage loan originations driven by a decrease in residential  mortgage  interest  rates in the latter part of 2014, and increased purchase volume favorably impacted by a drop in unemployment, improving housing prices, and lower down payment requirements.  If the current economic environment persists, Mortgage Guaranty expects to benefit through increased volume driven by purchase volume and for policies  originated in the higher interest rate environment prior to 2012, refinancing  activity. Mortgage Guaranty also expects current interest rates to have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written during 2012 and the first half of 2013, since refinancing would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the lower residential mortgage interest rates prevalent in that time period.  Mortgage Guaranty also  expects  that  newly  reported  delinquencies  will  continue to decline  during  the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. Mortgage Guaranty believes  the  combination  of  the factors described above will  result  in  favorable  operating  results  for  the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. On July 10, 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the GSEs) issued in draft form for public comment new eligibility requirements for private mortgage insurers that provide insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by them. The initial Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs) were issued by the GSEs on April 17, 2015 and revised on June 30, 2015. The new requirements, which will be effective on December 31, 2015, will mandate mortgage insurers to hold specified levels and types of assets in order to be able to pay a prescribed level of claims in certain stress scenarios. The most  significant  change  in  the  revision on June 30, 2015 was a  surcharge  to  the  asset       86       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      requirement for  lender-paid  mortgage insurance for  mortgages  originated  after  December  31,  2015. Mortgage Guaranty will meet these requirements on the effective date. These new requirements are not expected to have a material effect on AIG’s financial flexibility. Subject to interpretation and prospective amendment of the new requirements by the GSEs, Mortgage Guaranty estimates its minimum required assets under PMIERs would have been $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2015, had the rules been in effect at that time, and its estimated available assets would have exceeded the estimated required assets. Mortgage Guaranty’s estimates may change depending on future interpretations or prospective amendments by the GSEs. Institutional Markets         Institutional Markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management from the stable value wrap business, as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to pension buyouts. Volatility in the earnings from our alternative investment portfolio will continue to affect Institutional Markets’ results. Strategic Initiatives          Customer           Our vision is to be our customers’ most valued insurer. We expect that investments in underwriting, claims services, client risk services, science and data will continue to differentiate AIG from its peers and drive a superior client experience. An example of this approach can be found with the growth in our large limit property business where investments in client risk services and engineering are opening new opportunities with clients in this segment.  Strategic Growth          Property Casualty continues to improve decision-making, risk acceptance and pricing based on its ongoing efforts to refine segmentation by customer, industry and geography. For example, after enhancing the segmentation of workers’ compensation, Property Casualty has observed different experience and trends, which helps inform its risk appetite, pricing and loss mitigation decisions. As part of our strategic goal of diversifying product offerings and providing customers with greater access to unique insurance programs, on March 31, 2015, we paid approximately $239 million to acquire a controlling stake in NSM Insurance Group (NSM), a leading U.S. managing general agent and insurance program administrator. NSM is known for its unique development and implementation of programs for a broad range of niche customer segments. We expect the acquisition of NSM to facilitate closer strategic coordination and provide us with access to new, attractive markets including programs, specialty small commercial insurance solutions, and complementary distribution networks.  Mortgage Guaranty expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing its proprietary risk-based pricing strategy. This pricing strategy provides Mortgage Guaranty’s customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk, which we believe will result in an appropriately priced, high-quality book of business. Institutional Markets is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management with stable value wraps and utilizing a disciplined approach to growth and diversification of our business by pursuing select opportunities in areas such as the pension buyout business.     87       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Capital Efficiency            Commercial Insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad‑based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, Commercial Insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency, although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility. We also continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency for regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency, particularly with respect to the Non-Life Insurance Companies in the Property Casualty and Personal Insurance operating segments. Our legal entity restructuring initiatives have enhanced dividend capacity and reduced required capital. Additionally, the restructuring allows us to simplify our reinsurance arrangements, which further facilitate increased capital optimization. We expect our overall legal entity restructuring to be substantially completed in mid-2017, subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions. consumer insurance STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND Outlook              Strategic Initiatives     Customer — Aspire to be our customers’ most valued insurer. Through our unique franchise, which brings together a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and personal insurance products offered through multiple distribution networks, Consumer Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, delivered through the channels they prefer. Information-driven Strategy —  Utilize customer insight, analytics and the application of science to optimize customer acquisition, product profitability, product mix, channel performance and risk management capabilities. Focused Growth — Invest in areas where Consumer Insurance can grow profitably and sustainably. Target growth in select markets according to market size, growth potential, market maturity and customer demographics. Operational Effectiveness — Simplify processes, enhance operating environments, and leverage the best platforms and tools for multiple operating segments to increase competitiveness, improve service and product capabilities and facilitate delivery of our target customer experience. Investment Strategy — Maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that largely matches the duration characteristics of the related insurance liabilities, and pursue yield-enhancement opportunities that meet liquidity, risk and return objectives. Profitability and Capital Management — Deliver solid earnings through disciplined pricing and expense management, sustainable underwriting improvements and diversification of risk, and increase capital efficiency within insurance entities to enhance return on equity.      Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Retirement         Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement, which continues to drive demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features. In addition, higher tax rates      88       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk-averse investors to seek products without guaranteed living benefits, providing the opportunity to further diversify our product portfolio by offering investment-focused variable annuities.  The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. In addition, more highly leveraged competitors have entered the market offering higher crediting rates. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In April 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued a proposed regulation that substantially expands the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code. This proposed regulation has generated substantial attention in our industry. The DOL has held public hearings on the proposal, with the final public comment period for the proposed regulation having concluded in late September 2015. The proposal is subject to additional regulatory review and potential modification before the final regulation, if any, is adopted. It is unknown at this time whether or how any final regulation may be different from that proposed. If finalized as originally proposed, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to ERISA-covered plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis could be substantially limited from what is allowed under current law. These changes could have a material impact on the types, levels and compensation structures of the investment products and services we provide. Life         Populations are living longer and have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. The Life operating segment addresses these needs with a broad spectrum of products, ranging from the pure protection focus of term life to indexed universal life and investment-oriented products such as variable universal life. Market factors, primarily low interest rates and regulatory changes, have caused the universal life market to shift its focus from guaranteed universal life to indexed universal life products that offer cash accumulation and living benefit options. Personal Insurance         The overall rate level has improved in the Japanese and certain U.S. markets for auto, personal property, and accident and health products compared to prior years. In Japan, car and home sales increased in the first quarter of 2014 prior to a consumption tax increase, but subsequently new car sales have been trending down, while new housing starts have begun to strengthen in recent months. In the U.S., rate level changes for auto and personal property products are expected to be positive but slow, with sales increasing as the economy continues to improve. Our Personal Insurance operating segment continues to invest selectively in markets where we believe higher potential for personal insurance products exists. Strategic Initiatives           Customer         We are working to expand relationships with key distribution partners to fully realize the benefits of our diverse product offerings across our multiple distribution channels. Our focus on ease of doing business for consumers and producers includes enhancements to our platforms and services, as well as initiatives to improve the recruitment, training and productivity of our affiliated and non-affiliated distribution partners.     89       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Information-driven Strategy         We believe that strengthening our marketing capabilities through the use of analytics, stronger platforms and tools, an enhanced product portfolio and expanded relationships can allow us to bring more product solutions to our target markets.  We intend to achieve rate adequacy through implementation of global underwriting practices and enhanced tools and analytics, and to optimize the value of our business lines through product and portfolio management and refined technical pricing. We strive to enhance the customer experience and efficiency through claims best practices, and to deploy enhanced operating structures and standardized processes and systems, while managing claims-handling efficiency. Focused Growth         Retirement Income Solutions intends to continue capitalizing on the opportunity to meet consumer demand for guaranteed income by maintaining competitive variable annuity product offerings while managing risk through innovative product design and well-developed economic hedging capabilities. Risk mitigation features of its variable annuity product design include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider fees that are indexed to an equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts, and the utilization of volatility control funds. Retirement Income Solutions continues to invest in hedging and market risk management capabilities. Retirement Income Solutions is also focused on diversifying its product portfolio by growing sales of fixed index annuities with guarantee features, which provide additional income solutions for consumers approaching retirement, and introducing new investment-focused variable annuities, which offer various investment options, including alternative asset classes, to investors seeking higher returns. Fixed Annuities sales will continue to be challenged by the low interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits. The growing market for immediate and deferred income products, driven by customers seeking guaranteed income products, provides an opportunity for Fixed Annuities to increase the diversification of its product portfolio. Life will continue to invest to position itself for growth, serve its customers more effectively, and maintain pricing discipline in its overall strategy. Life recently announced changes to simplify its structure, improve ease of doing business and better serve the unique needs of the customers in each region. Life’s organization has been aligned to serve its customers in the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA regions with a focus on the demographic, governmental and socioeconomic trends unique to each region. As part of this initiative, our Group Benefits business will merge with our U.S. Life, Health and Disability business to focus on strong existing relationships with multi-line and specialty producers. Life intends to expand its business through a focused strategy in selected markets and products, combining global expertise with local market intelligence to meet the needs of consumers in target markets. On March 31, 2015, we acquired Laya Healthcare, Ireland’s second largest primary health insurance provider. Laya Healthcare covers approximately 500,000 lives for primary healthcare, and also offers other adjacent coverage including life, dental and travel insurance. Personal Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, delivered with excellent customer service through the channels they prefer. Personal Insurance is focused on profitable growth in its selected market segments, with targeted investments in both scale businesses and emerging markets. Personal Insurance will continue to leverage its strong risk management and market expertise to foster growth by providing innovative and competitive solutions to its customers and distributors. Operational Effectiveness         We are continuing to invest in initiatives that we believe will make our operating platforms simpler and more agile, enabling us to provide superior service and accommodate significant future growth. In Japan, we continue to invest in technology to improve operating efficiency and ease of doing business for our distribution partners and customers, with the goal of increasing      90       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      our market share and facilitating our expansion in market segments where we expect growth, given current demographic trends. In the U.S. Life business, we are focused on leveraging our most efficient systems and increasing automation of our underwriting process. We believe that simplifying our operating models and implementing common functionality across our Consumer Insurance product lines and borders will enhance productivity and support further profitable growth. Profitability and Capital Management         We are focused on enhancing profitability and capital efficiency within our insurance entities through disciplined pricing, in-force profitability management and effective management of risk. For product lines where we have significant equity market risk and exposure to changes in interest rates, we use risk management tools, such as the risk mitigation product features and hedging program in our Retirement Income Solutions variable annuity business. Additionally, our scale and the breadth of our product offerings provide diversification of risk. Within our Non-Life Insurance Companies, we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital efficiency.

The tax charge was primarily due to increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross-border financing transactions, partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax-exempt interest income and the partial completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination covering tax year 2006.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 34.5 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax-exempt interest income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously released to accumulated other comprehensive income, and the partial completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination covering tax year 2006, partially offset by tax charges associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross-border financing transactions and increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with certain foreign jurisdictions. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 includes an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily attributable to the effects of changes in the Japanese tax law enacted on March 31, 2015, partially offset by changes in projections of future taxable income. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.2 percent and 29.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations in both periods differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax-exempt interest income and a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset valuation allowance.

However, because we reported after-tax operating income, the calculation of after-tax operating income per diluted share includes dilutive shares of 40,356,170.      92       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG decreased in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in income from insurance operations, reflecting decreased net investment income, and lower income on assets marked to fair value through earnings, including part of our holdings in People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group) and PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) shares and assets in Corporate and Other.  For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 19.3 percent and 33.6 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, certain tax benefits associated with the partial completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination covering tax year 2006 and the impact of other discrete tax benefits. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 31.6 percent and 33.1 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, certain tax benefits associated with the partial completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination covering tax year 2006 and the impact of other discrete tax benefits.

The decrease was primarily due to lower Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income, which reflected lower net investment income and lower underwriting income, and lower Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income, which reflected lower net investment income and less favorable adjustments to reflect the update of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by higher policy and advisory fees. Lower net realized capital gains from sales of investments and higher other-than-temporary impairment charges, a decrease in non-operating litigation reserves and settlements, and restructuring and other costs also contributed to the decrease in pre-tax income for the three-month period ended September 31, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by lower loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing liability management activities.  YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME COMPARISON FOR 2015 AND 2014  Pre-tax income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income, reflecting lower net investment income and lower underwriting income, and a decrease in Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income, reflecting lower net investment income, less favorable adjustments to reflect the update of actuarial assumptions and less favorable mortality experience in Life (partially offset by higher policy and advisory fees), as well as restructuring and other costs and lower income from divested businesses as a result of the sale of ILFC in the second quarter of 2014. These decreases were partially offset by a lower loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing liability management activities and an increase from the change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of economic hedges, as discussed below. Higher net realized capital gains from sales of investments, which included realized gains on the sales of Class B shares of Prudential Financial, Inc., a portion of our holdings in PICC P&C shares and common shares of Springleaf Holdings Inc. (Springleaf), were partially offset by a realized loss on the sale of ordinary shares of AerCap and an increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges.  The change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity GMWB and GMAV, net of the change in fair value of all related economic hedges, increased pre-tax income by $468 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The overall increase in market interest rates during the first half of 2015 drove a decrease in the liability for GMWB and GMAV, which was partially offset by a decrease in market interest rates and lower equity market performance in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The net decrease in the fair value of the GMWB and GMAV in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 and the impact of interest rate and equity hedges, including losses in the fair value of bonds used to hedge interest rate and credit spread risks, resulted in an increase      94       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      in pre-tax income compared to the same period in the prior year, in which the net impact was not significant. A small portion of the increase in the GMWB liability was due to annual review and update of actuarial assumptions. See Insurance Reserves – Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves – Update of Actuarial Assumptions for additional discussion. Net Investment Income         Net investment income is attributed to the operating segments of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses. For Commercial Insurance — Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance — Personal Insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each operating segment. The net investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus a liquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities, and excludes net investment income associated with the run-off insurance lines reported in Corporate and Other. The remaining excess is attributed to Commercial Insurance — Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance — Personal Insurance based on the relative net investment income previously allocated. For Commercial Insurance — Institutional Markets, Consumer Insurance — Retirement and Consumer Insurance — Life, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios. Invested assets in excess of liabilities are allocated to product lines based on internal capital estimates. Foreign Currency Impact         Property Casualty, International Life and Personal Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the currencies that have the most significant impact on our businesses:         Three Months Ended                   Nine Months Ended                     September 30,       Percentage           September 30,       Percentage         Rate for 1 USD   2015   2014       Change           2015   2014       Change         Currency:                                                 JPY   123.35   102.24       21   %       120.79   102.53       18   %     EUR   0.90   0.74       22   %       0.89   0.73       22   %     GBP   0.64   0.59       8   %       0.65   0.60       8   %    Unless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the Commercial and Consumer discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the three currencies included in the preceding table (the Major Currencies).   COMMERCIAL INSURANCE         Commercial Insurance presents its financial information in three operating segments – Property Casualty, Mortgage Guaranty and Institutional Markets.  Property Casualty provides insurance solutions for large and small businesses.

The increase in underwriting loss reflected a higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, as well as a net loss reserve discount charge for workers’ compensation reserves in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to a net loss reserve discount benefit in the same period in the prior year, which were partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and a decrease in net adverse prior year loss reserve development. The current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased primarily due to higher current accident year losses in healthcare and in U.S. commercial automobile liability, as well as higher attritional and severe losses in Property, partially offset by lower accident year losses in Specialty in all regions. The current accident year losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 included six severe losses totaling $209 million compared to nine severe losses totaling $188 million in the same period in the prior year. The net loss reserve discount charge was $41 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to a benefit of $16 million in the same period      97       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      in the prior year, primarily reflecting declines in Treasury rates, which were partially offset by an increase in credit spreads. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Catastrophe losses were $88 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $262 million in the same period in the prior year. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including return premiums of $30 million, was $186 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $226 million, which included additional premiums of $93 million in the same period of the prior year. The net adverse prior year loss reserve development decreased primarily due to a decrease in net adverse prior year loss reserve development in Casualty, and an increase in net favorable prior year loss development in Property, partially offset by an increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development in Specialty environmental. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Loss Development for further discussion.  Acquisition expenses increased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in commission expenses in certain classes of business in Specialty mostly offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies, as discussed above. General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies, as discussed above. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, general operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of NSM, whose expenses were consolidated commencing in the second quarter of 2015. This increase was partially offset by lower pension expenses from a pension curtailment credit, and efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to losses on alternative investments reflecting negative performance in hedge funds as well as fair market value declines on assets accounted for under the fair value option, particularly in PICC P&C shares. In the same period in the prior year, Property Casualty recorded net investment income on both alternative investments and the PICC P&C shares.  See MD&A — Investments for additional information on the Non-Life Insurance Companies invested assets, investment strategy, and asset-liability management process. Property Casualty Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in net investment income and lower underwriting income. Underwriting income decreased primarily due to an increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, partially offset by decreases in catastrophe losses. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments, was $493 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $323 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development was primarily due to higher prior year loss reserve development in Casualty, partially offset by an improvement in Financial lines and Specialty. Premium adjustments consisted of return premiums of $53 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to additional premiums of $157 million in the same period in the prior year. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Loss Development for further discussion. Current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased primarily due to higher current accident year losses in U.S. Casualty. Net loss reserve discount benefit was $136 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to $158 million in the same period in the prior year. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Catastrophe losses were $368 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to $567 million in the same period in the prior year. Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies, as discussed above. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, acquisition expenses increased primarily due to an increase in commission expenses in certain classes of business in Specialty.     98       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      General operating expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, partially offset by increased technology-related costs, and the acquisition of NSM, whose expenses were consolidated commencing in the second quarter of 2015. Net investment income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments and a decrease in net investment income related to assets accounted for under the fair value option.

The effect of foreign exchange was partially offset by an increase in new and renewal business in all other lines of business. Net premiums written decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the first quarter renewal of a multi-year policy in U.S. Financial lines, and new business growth in Property and Financial lines across all regions, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Casualty as a result of continued focus on the execution of its strategic objectives and the optimization of its product portfolio. Casualty net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting rate pressure and continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection and optimize our product portfolio particularly in the U.S. Additionally, net premiums written included return premiums related to the loss sensitive businesses of $30 million and $53 million, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to additional premiums of $93 million and $157 million in the same periods in the prior year, respectively. An increase in new business in targeted growth products in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, particularly in EMEA, was more than offset by the declines in certain residual programs. Property net premiums written were unchanged in the three -month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year and declined slightly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 from the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher retention and new business in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Specialty net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to new business increases in targeted growth products, particularly in the U.S., partially offset by a slight decline in U.S. and EMEA Aerospace. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to new business increases and higher retention related to targeted growth products, particularly in the Americas, and EMEA, partially offset by a decrease in certain classes of business, particularly in the U.S as a result of the effect of our strategy to enhance risk selection. Financial lines net premiums written decreased in the three -month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Major Currencies. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting continued execution of our growth strategy, particularly in the Americas, partially offset by a decrease in certain classes of business as a result of increased competition and underwriting discipline. Net premiums written increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to strong growth in new business and higher retention related to targeted growth products across all regions, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies. Additionally, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, reflected the first quarter renewal of a multi-year E&O policy in the U.S.      100       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Property Casualty Net Premiums Written by Region           The following table presents Property Casualty’s net premiums written by region:                            Percentage           Percentage                               Percentage           Percentage             Three Months Ended       Change in           Change in           Nine Months Ended       Change in           Change in             September 30,       U.S.           Original           September 30,       U.S.           Original         (in millions)       2015       2014       dollars           Currency               2015       2014       dollars            Currency          Property Casualty:                                                                                         Americas   $   3,525   $   3,643       (3)   %       (2)   %       $   10,366   $   10,548       (2)   %       (1)   %     Asia Pacific       519       590       (12)           2               1,461       1,550       (6)           6         EMEA       1,158       1,276       (9)           1               4,005       4,230       (5)           6         Total net premiums written   $   5,202   $   5,509       (6)   %       (1)   %       $   15,832   $   16,328       (3)   %       2   %         property casualty NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN by Region   (in millions)          The Americas net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection and optimize our product portfolio in Casualty largely offset by strong growth in new business related to targeted growth products in Property, Specialty and Financial lines.

Property Casualty Quarterly and Year-to-Date Insurance Ratios The combined ratio increased by 0.6 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the expense ratio partially offset by a decrease in the loss ratio. The loss ratio decreased by 1.0 point in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and a decrease in the net adverse prior year loss development partially offset by higher attritional losses and an increased net loss reserve discount charge. The combined ratio increased by 0.4 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher accident year losses. The loss ratio increased by 0.3 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher net adverse prior year loss development and an increase in attritional losses partially offset by lower catastrophe losses. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, increased by 3.9 points and 0.7 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a higher accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and an increase in the acquisition ratio. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 2.3 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher current accident year losses in healthcare and in commercial automobile liability in U.S. Casualty, as well as higher attritional losses and severe losses in Property, partially offset by an improvement in Specialty and certain workers’ compensation and primary business in U.S. Casualty as a result of our focus on portfolio optimization. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.6 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in healthcare and commercial automobile liability in U.S. Casualty, partially offset by lower attritional losses in U.S. Property, and Specialty, particularly in the U.S. and EMEA. Severe losses represented approximately 4.2 points and 3.5 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to 3.5 points and 3.4 points, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The acquisition ratio increased by 1.1 points and 0.3 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher commission expenses in certain classes of business in Specialty.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.5 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a lower net premium earned base and the acquisition of NSM, whose expenses were consolidated commencing in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by cost efficiency and lower pension      104       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      expenses. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.2 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives partially offset by the NSM addition to expenses, higher technology-related expenses, as well as a lower net premium earned base.

First-Lien Results First-lien pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting an increase in underwriting income. First-lien net premiums earned in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, increased by $7 million compared to the same period in the prior year largely from growth in the business. First-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased by $16 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The combined ratio decreased by 9.7 points to 46.0 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting an improvement in overall underwriting results.     106       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Acquisition expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of sales support activities related to the increase in new insurance written. General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to $4 million of asset write offs during the same period in the prior year. Other Business Results Other business results include second-lien insurance, student loan insurance and non-domestic mortgage insurance operations. The Other business’ pre-tax operating income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, was approximately $14 million, compared to $10 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a decline in losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses, partially offset by a decrease in net premiums earned and a decline in net investment income. Mortgage Guaranty Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in first-lien net premiums earned as a result of higher new insurance written, an acceleration of earnings on the cancellations of single premium business for which a return premium is generally not required, a decline in incurred losses from lower delinquency rates and higher cure rates. First-Lien Results First-lien pre-tax operating income increased $38 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to improved underwriting income as a result of a $32 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, largely from growth in the book of business and the acceleration of premiums earned as a result of cancellations of single premium business and a $24 million decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses, offset in part by a $20 million increase in acquisition and general operating expenses. The combined ratio was 49.2 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to 52.5 points in the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the loss ratio, partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio. Acquisition expenses increased slightly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of sales support activities related to the increase in new insurance written. General operating expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in servicing costs related to the growth of the in-force business. Other Business Results The Other business’ pre-tax operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $43 million compared to $39 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a decline in general operating expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by a decline in net premiums earned and a decline in net investment income. New Insurance Written on Domestic First-Lien Mortgage Loans         In the third quarter of 2015, Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first-lien new insurance written was $14.5 billion compared to $12.6 billion for the same period in the prior year, reflecting the expansion in the mortgage originations market caused by a reduction in mortgage interest rates in the latter part of 2014 and increased purchase volume favorably impacted by a drop in unemployment, improved housing prices, and lower down payment requirements. Domestic first-lien new insurance written increased to $40.2 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $31.3 billion in the same period      107       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      in the prior year, driven by an increase in refinancing, improvements in existing home sales due to lower down payment requirements and new purchase volume. Delinquency Inventory         The delinquency inventory for domestic first-lien business declined during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 as a result of cures and paid claims exceeding the number of newly reported delinquencies. Mortgage Guaranty’s first-lien primary delinquency ratio at September 30, 2015 was 3.5 percent compared to 4.6 percent at September 30, 2014. Over the last several years, Mortgage Guaranty has experienced a decline in newly reported defaults and an increase in cure rates. The following table provides a summary of activity in Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first lien delinquency inventory:    Nine Months Ended September 30,                                     (number of policies)                   2015           2014     Number of delinquencies at the beginning of the year                   38,357           47,518     Newly reported                   29,450           35,474     Cures                   (27,946)           (33,260)     Claims paid                   (6,728)           (8,783)     Other                   (1,225)           (1,727)     Number of delinquencies at the end of the period                   31,908           39,222    Mortgage Guaranty Quarterly and Year-to-Date Underwriting Ratios         The following tables present the Mortgage Guaranty combined ratios based on GAAP data:        Three Months Ended               Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       Increase       September 30,       Increase             2015       2014       (Decrease)           2015       2014       (Decrease)     Loss ratio       18.1       27.8       (9.7)           20.9       26.1       (5.2)     Acquisition ratio       8.6       7.9       0.7           9.0       8.1       0.9     General operating expense ratio       18.1       20.3       (2.2)           17.6       18.0       (0.4)     Expense ratio       26.7       28.2       (1.5)           26.6       26.1       0.5     Combined ratio       44.8       56.0       (11.2)           47.5       52.2       (4.7)    The combined ratio decreased by 11.2 points and 4.7 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in the ratio in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 was driven primarily by a reduction in the loss ratio due to a decline in incurred losses driven by lower delinquencies and higher cure rates. The acquisition ratio increased by 0.7 points and 0.9 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the increases in expenses related to sales activities supporting new insurance written. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 2.2 points and 0.4 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in earned premiums.     108       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Institutional Markets Results         The following table presents Institutional Markets results:        Three Months Ended                   Nine Months Ended                     September 30,       Percentage           September 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2015       2014       Change               2015       2014       Change         Revenues:                                                                 Premiums   $   115   $   108       6   %       $   854   $   368       132   %     Policy fees       49       49       -               148       138       7         Net investment income       414       469       (12)               1,372       1,522       (10)         Benefits and expenses:                                                                 Policyholder benefits and losses incurred       363       345       5               1,603       1,094       47         Interest credited to policyholder account balances       102       105       (3)               306       308       (1)         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       1       -       NM               2       2       -         Other acquisition expenses       9       8       13               24       25       (4)         General operating expenses       19       15       27               57       47       21         Pre-tax operating income   $   84   $   153       (45)           $   382   $   552       (31)             INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS pre-tax OPERATING INCOME (in millions)           Institutional Markets Quarterly Results Pre-tax operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net investment income and an increase in policyholder benefits resulting from a large claim in the current year period. Net investment income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to losses on alternative investments from negative performance in hedge funds. See MD&A – Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Institutional Markets business. General operating expenses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense.      109       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Institutional Markets Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net investment income. Fee income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by growth in reserves and assets under management, primarily from continued development of the stable value wrap business. The notional amount of stable value wrap assets under management at September 30, 2015 grew by $4.8 billion or 17 percent from September 30, 2014. The increases in premiums and in benefit expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, were primarily due to the premium received and establishment of the future policy benefit reserve for a large terminal funding annuity issued during the first half of 2015. Net investment income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments and lower yield enhancements from bond call and tender income. See MD&A – Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Institutional Markets business. General operating expenses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher state guaranty fund assessment expenses, technology investments and higher interest expense. Institutional Markets Premiums and Deposits         For Institutional Markets, premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent payout annuities or structured settlements. Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance and investment-type annuity contracts, including GICs and stable value wrap funding agreements. The following table presents a reconciliation of Institutional Markets premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended         September 30,       September 30,     (in millions)       2015       2014           2015       2014     Premiums and deposits   $   159   $   2,840       $   985   $   3,182     Deposits       (33)       (2,725)           (104)       (2,797)     Other       (11)       (7)           (27)       (17)     Premiums    $   115   $   108       $   854   $   368    Premiums and deposits for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a $2.5 billion deposit to the separate accounts of one of the Life Insurance Companies for a stable value wrap funding agreement that was reflected in the prior year periods. Excluding the $2.5 billion deposit in the prior year period, premiums and deposits for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher premiums, which reflected a large single premium for a terminal funding annuity agreement in the first half of 2015.

The update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment to Retirement pre-tax operating earnings of $140 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to a net positive adjustment of $256 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014. In Fixed Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $92 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, which reflected refinements to investment spread assumptions, lower terminations than previously assumed and decreases to expense assumptions. The three-month period ended September 30,      112       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      2014, included a net positive adjustment of $196 million in Fixed Annuities, primarily due to better spreads than previously assumed.   In Retirement Income Solutions, there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees, modeled expenses, and terminations, resulting in no net adjustment to pre-tax operating earnings in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to a $14 million net positive adjustment in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to the update of mortality assumptions. In Group Retirement, a net positive adjustment from the update of estimated gross profit assumptions of $48 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to revisions to mortality and surrender assumptions, partially offset by decreased spread assumptions. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, a net positive adjustment of $46 million in Group Retirement was primarily due to more favorable assumptions for investment spreads and surrenders than previously assumed. See Insurance Reserves - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves – Update of Actuarial Assumptions for adjustments by product line and financial statement line item, and discussion of adjustments related to the update of assumptions for the valuation of variable annuity GMWB features in the Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines, which are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value, with the change in fair value recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) and excluded from pre-tax operating income. Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to losses on alternative investments from negative performance in hedge funds, lower income from yield enhancements and lower base net investment income. These declines were partially offset by higher gains in private equity fund partnerships and affordable housing partnerships. Yield enhancements in the same period in the prior year reflected higher bond call and tender income and higher income on investments for which the fair value option was elected, including the investment in PICC Group then held by the Life Insurance Companies. Base net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of lower base yields from reinvestment at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business. Overall, Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 declined compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment. While average interest crediting rates were down slightly due to active rate management, the decline in base yields compressed base spreads in Fixed Annuities. See Spread Management below for additional discussion. General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due in part to technology investments and higher expenses associated with continued strong sales in the Retirement Income Solutions product line. Retirement Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income, a lower net positive adjustment to reflect the update of actuarial assumptions and higher general operating expenses, partially offset by growth in fee income. In addition, DAC amortization in Retirement Income Solutions increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 due to growth in the business and lower equity market returns compared to the same period in the prior year. Base net investment income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, which compressed base spreads, but this decrease was partially offset by higher policy fees and advisory fees due to growth in variable annuity separate account assets under management, principally driven by positive net flows.     113       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments and lower base net investment income. Base net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of lower base yields from reinvestment at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio. This overall decrease in base net investment income compared to the same period in the prior year was partially offset in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 by additional accretion on a security held in Group Retirement. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business. Overall, Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 declined compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment. While average interest crediting rates were down slightly due to active rate management, the decline in base yield resulted in spread compression in Fixed Annuities base spreads compared to the same period in the prior year. Group Retirement base spread was flat compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to additional accretion income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, which offset the decline in base yield. See Spread Management below for additional discussion. General operating expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due in part to technology investments and higher expenses associated with continued strong sales in the Retirement Income Solutions product line. Spread Management The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the Life Insurance Companies’ asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. Disciplined pricing on new business and active crediting rate management are used in the Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement product lines to partially offset the impact of a continued decline in base yields resulting from investment of available cash flows in the low interest rate environment. Disciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of annuity products at targeted net investment spreads in the current rate environment. Retirement has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products that had higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. As a result, new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of one percent. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions in annuity products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Retirement will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields. In addition to deferred annuity products, certain traditional long-duration products for which Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. As of September 30, 2015, Retirement’s fixed annuity reserves, which include fixed options offered within variable annuities sold in the Group Retirement and Retirement Income Solutions product lines as well as reserves of the Fixed Annuities product line, had minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older in-force products. As indicated in the table below, approximately 73 percent of annuity account values were at their minimum crediting rates as of September 30, 2015, compared to 71 percent at December 31, 2014. As a result of      114       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      disciplined pricing on new business and the run-off of older business with higher minimum crediting rates, fixed annuity account values having contractual minimum guaranteed rates above 1 percent decreased to 75 percent of total fixed annuity reserves at September 30, 2015 from 79 percent at December 31, 2014.

Retirement Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows           Premiums  For Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds. The following table presents a reconciliation of Retirement premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended         September 30,       September 30,     (in millions)       2015       2014           2015       2014     Premiums and deposits*   $   6,625   $   5,863       $   18,204   $   18,033     Deposits       (6,542)       (5,822)           (18,079)       (17,951)     Other       (46)       26           2       139     Premiums    $   37   $   67       $   127   $   221    * Excludes activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities.     115       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Premiums decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower immediate annuity premiums in the Fixed Annuities product line.

RETIREMENT PREMIUMS AND DEPOSITS by Product Line (in millions)                   116       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Premiums and deposits for Retirement increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales in Fixed Annuities, Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Funds product lines. Premiums and deposits increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in Retirement Income Solutions, partially offset by lower sales in Fixed Annuities. Net flows for annuity products included in the Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows from mutual funds, which are included in both the Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement product lines, represent deposits less withdrawals.  Total net flows for Retirement in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 improved compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher premiums and deposits in Fixed Annuities, Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Funds. Surrender and withdrawal activity in Group Retirement and Retail Mutual Funds improved in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to higher levels for the prior year period. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, total net flows for Retirement increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to continued growth in Retirement Income Solutions and a significant reduction in the level of withdrawals in Retail Mutual Fund, partially offset by lower net flows from Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement. Premiums and Deposits and Net Flows by Product Line A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows: Fixed Annuities deposits and net flows increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to new product offerings and an increase in fixed deferred annuities bank channel sales driven by higher rates as a result of widening credit spreads. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, deposits decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, and net flows continued to be negative, primarily due to lower sales in the sustained low interest rate environment. Retirement Income Solutions premiums and deposits and net flows decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to lower variable annuity sales partially offset by growth in index annuities. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, premiums and deposits and net flows increased compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in index annuity sales. The improvement in surrender rates (see Surrender Rates below) for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year, was primarily due to the significant growth in account value driven by the high volume of sales, which has increased the proportion of business that is within the surrender charge period. Retail Mutual Fund net flows increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to improvement in the levels of deposits and withdrawals. Retail Mutual Fund net flows increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a reduction in the level of withdrawals. The increase in net flows in both periods compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily driven by activity within the Focused Dividend Strategy Fund. Group Retirement net flows in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 improved compared to the same period in the prior year, due to higher premiums and deposits and improved surrender activity compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2014, which included a large group surrender of approximately $700 million. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, net flows decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, due to both a decrease in premiums and deposits and an increase in surrender activity. The increase in the surrender rate compared to the same period in the prior year was due in part to large group surrenders of approximately $1.1 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The large group market has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in our target markets.     117       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Surrender Rates The following table presents reserves for annuity product lines by surrender charge category:            September 30, 2015               December 31, 2014                 Group               Retirement               Group               Retirement                 Retirement       Fixed       Income               Retirement       Fixed       Income         (in millions)       Products(a)       Annuities       Solutions               Products(a)       Annuities       Solutions         No surrender charge(b)   $   59,860   $   35,000   $   1,027           $   61,751   $   34,396   $   1,871         0% - 2%       1,539       1,852       16,478               1,648       2,736       17,070         Greater than 2% - 4%       1,159       1,842       4,014               1,657       2,842       4,254         Greater than 4%       5,635       12,665       31,123               5,793       12,754       26,165         Non-surrenderable       688       3,610       172               770       3,464       151         Total reserves   $   68,881   $   54,969   $   52,814           $   71,619   $   56,192   $   49,511        (a) Excludes mutual fund assets under management of $14.0 billion and $14.6 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

Other income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, was primarily related to commission and profit sharing revenues received by Laya Healthcare for the distribution of insurance products. The net negative adjustment of $157 million related to an update of actuarial assumptions in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to lower assumed surrender rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees, which represent approximately eight percent of total U.S. life reserves. The net negative adjustment also reflected lower investment spread assumptions, partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality, as well as loss recognition expense of $39 million for certain discontinued long-term care products primarily due to lower future premium assumptions. These negative adjustments were partially offset by a decrease in certain Group Benefit claim reserves based on updated experience data. A net negative adjustment of $135 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 also included additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees, primarily due to lower investment spread and mortality assumptions which, while higher than previously assumed, were still within pricing assumptions. The net negative adjustment in the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 also included loss recognition expense of $87 million for certain long-term care business, primarily as a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, to a lesser extent, lower yield assumptions.  See Insurance Reserves - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves – Update of Actuarial Assumptions for amounts by product line and financial statement line item and additional discussion. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to losses on alternative investments from negative performance in hedge funds, lower income from yield enhancements and lower base net investment income. Yield enhancements in the prior year period reflected higher bond call and tender income and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, including the investment in PICC Group then held by the Life Insurance Companies.

Life Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income, mortality experience that was within pricing expectations but less favorable than the prior year period, and a higher net negative adjustment to reflect updated actuarial assumptions. Other income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, was primarily related to commission and profit sharing revenues received by Laya Healthcare for the distribution of insurance products. Net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower income on alternative investments and a decrease in base net investment income compared to the prior year period, due in part to participation income received on a commercial mortgage loan in the 2014 period. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional discussion of the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Life business.

Spread Management         Disciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of life products at targeted net investment spreads in the current interest rate environment. Life has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Life cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and zero to 2 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to meet targeted net investment spreads.  In-force Management. Crediting rates for in-force policies are adjusted in accordance with contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees.

Catastrophe losses were $58 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $22 million in the same period in the prior year. Net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $46 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $12 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, British pound and euro. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, acquisition expenses increased due to higher acquisition costs in the automobile business and higher profit share expenses related to warranty service programs, partially offset by a decrease in non-deferred direct marketing expenses. The non-deferred direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, were approximately $70 million, and, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $31 million from the same period in the prior year.  General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting the timing of investment in strategic initiatives together with an ongoing focus on cost efficiency. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by lower interest income and negative performance of alternative investments in hedge funds. The lower interest income was due to the continued impact of low interest rates resulting in yields on new purchases that were lower than the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies and lower allocation of net investment income.

Catastrophe losses were $135 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to $118 million in the same period in the prior year. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $59 million, compared to $42 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, acquisition expenses increased due to higher acquisition costs, primarily in automobile and property businesses, and higher profit share expenses related to warranty service programs, partially offset by a decrease in non-deferred direct marketing expenses. The non-deferred direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, were approximately $219 million, and, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $64 million from the same period in the prior year.  General operating expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, as the business continued to grow through multiple product and distribution channels.  A&H net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily, due to production increases in individual travel business in Latin America, group personal accident and the supplemental health business in Japan and individual personal accident outside of Japan, partially offset by the decrease in personal accident and travel businesses in the U.S. and EMEA, due to continued underwriting discipline. Personal Lines net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were primarily due to increased production in personal property business in the Americas and Asia Pacific and in the automobile business in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by decreased production of warranty service programs, due to underwriting actions taken in the prior year. The increase in the U.S. personal property business in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 was attributable to new business sales and improved retention in the private client group, whereas in Japan the increase was due to new business sales as a result of the recent increase in new housing starts. In addition, the increase in U.S. personal property business in the nine-month period September 30, 2015 reflected changes to optimize our reinsurance structure to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure.     124       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region         The following table presents Personal Insurance net premiums written by region:        Three Months Ended       Percentage           Percentage           Nine Months Ended       Percentage           Percentage             September 30,       Change in           Change in           September 30,       Change in           Change in         (in millions)       2015       2014       U.S. dollars           Original Currency               2015       2014       U.S. dollars           Original Currency         Americas   $   1,047   $   1,004       4   %       6   %       $   2,906   $   2,919       -   %       1   %     Asia Pacific       1,523       1,749       (13)           1               4,492       5,011       (10)           2         EMEA       446       488       (9)           6               1,463       1,616       (9)           5         Total net premiums written   $   3,016   $   3,241       (7)   %       4   %       $   8,861   $   9,546       (7)   %       2   %         Personal insurance NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN by Region   (in millions)      Americas net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in personal property and automobile businesses, partially offset by a decrease in net premiums written in warranty service programs and group accident business in the U.S. Net premiums written in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 remained essentially unchanged compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, due to growth in personal property and automobile businesses, offset by decreases in warranty service programs, individual travel and group accident businesses in the U.S. The growth in personal property business is primarily driven by new business sales and improved retention in the U.S. private client group, as well as the changes in the reinsurance structure discussed above. Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to increased production in personal property, individual personal accident and supplemental health businesses, partially offset by decreases in automobile and warranty service programs. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, across almost all lines of business, primarily due to businesses with increased production, as discussed above.  EMEA net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased, particularly in automobile due to new business and in warranty service programs, partially offset by decreases in group personal accident and travel business due to continued underwriting discipline.     125       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Personal Insurance Underwriting Ratios         The following tables present the Personal Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:        Three Months Ended           Nine Months Ended                 September 30,   Increase       September 30,       Increase         2015       2014   (Decrease)       2015       2014       (Decrease)     Loss ratio   53.4       53.0   0.4       55.0       55.2       (0.2)     Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums   (2.0)       (0.7)   (1.3)       (1.6)       (1.3)       (0.3)     Prior year development net of premium adjustments   1.6       0.4   1.2       0.7       0.4       0.3     Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted   53.0       52.7   0.3       54.1       54.3       (0.2)     Acquisition ratio   28.4       26.6   1.8       27.9       26.7       1.2     General operating expense ratio    17.8       19.8   (2.0)       18.0       18.5       (0.5)     Expense ratio   46.2       46.4   (0.2)       45.9       45.2       0.7     Combined ratio   99.6       99.4   0.2       100.9       100.4       0.5     Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums   (2.0)       (0.7)   (1.3)       (1.6)       (1.3)       (0.3)     Prior year development net of premium adjustments   1.6       0.4   1.2       0.7       0.4       0.3     Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted   99.2       99.1   0.1       100.0       99.5       0.5         Personal Insurance ratios  Three Months Ended September 30,     Nine Months Ended September 30,                      126       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE                The following tables present Personal Insurance accident year catastrophe and severe losses by region and the number of events: Catastrophes (a)        # of       Asia                 (in millions)   Events   Americas   Pacific   EMEA       Total     Three Months Ended September 30, 2015                                         Windstorms and hailstorms   2   $   4   $   33   $   -   $   37     Wildfire   1       1       -       -       1     Tropical cyclone   1       -       20       -       20     Total catastrophe-related charges   4   $   5   $   53   $   -   $   58     Three Months Ended September 30, 2014                                         Flooding   2   $   2   $   -   $   -   $   2     Windstorms and hailstorms   5       9       10       -       19     Earthquakes   1       1       -       -       1     Total catastrophe-related charges   8   $   12   $   10   $   -   $   22     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015                                         Flooding   2   $   4   $   -   $   -   $   4     Windstorms and hailstorms   9       77       33       -       110     Wildfire   1       1       -       -       1     Tropical cyclone   1       -       20       -       20     Total catastrophe-related charges   13   $   82   $   53   $   -   $   135     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014                                         Flooding   2   $   2   $   -   $   -   $   2     Windstorms and hailstorms   14       60       54       1       115     Earthquakes   1       1       -       -       1     Total catastrophe-related charges   17   $   63   $   54   $   1   $   118    (a) Catastrophes are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each.      127       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Severe Losses(b)        # of       Asia                 (in millions)   Events   Americas   Pacific   EMEA       Total     Three Months Ended September 30,                                         2015   -   $   -   $   -   $   -   $   -     2014   -   $   -   $   -   $   -   $   -     Nine Months Ended September 30,                                         2015   1   $   12   $   -   $   -   $   12     2014   3   $   37   $   4   $   -   $   41    (b) Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophe individual first party losses and surety losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance and salvage and subrogation. Personal Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Insurance Ratios The combined ratio increased by 0.2 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in the expense ratio. The combined ratio increased by 0.5 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the expense ratio, partially offset by a decrease in the loss ratio. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.1 point and 0.5 points in the three- and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.3 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher losses in automobile and personal property businesses, partially offset by improved performance in warranty service programs. The loss ratio improvement in warranty service programs was offset by an increase in the acquisition ratio due to a related profit sharing arrangement. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 0.2 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a decrease in losses in warranty service programs and lower severe losses, partially offset by higher losses in automobile and personal property businesses.  The acquisition ratio increased by 1.8 points and 1.2 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in acquisition costs in warranty service programs and in the automobile business, partially offset by lower A&H direct marketing expenses.  The general operating expense ratio decreased by 2.0 points in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the timing of investment in strategic initiatives together with an ongoing focus on cost efficiency. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.5 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an ongoing focus on cost efficiency.    CORPORATE AND OTHER         As a result of the progress of the wind down and de-risking activities of the DIB and the derivative portfolio of AIGFP included within GCM, AIG has discontinued separate reporting of the DIB and GCM.

(b) During the first quarter of 2015, Non-Life Insurance Companies sold a portion of their investment in PICC P&C to AIG Parent. During 2014, the Life Insurance Companies sold their investment in PICC Group to AIG Parent. (c) Consists of the results of investments held by AIG Parent to support various corporate needs as well as the remaining positions of AIGFP, life settlements, real estate, equipment leasing and lending and other secured lending investments held by AIG Parent and certain subsidiaries.   Corporate and Other Quarterly Results Corporate and Other reported a pre-tax operating loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to pre-tax operating income in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs as a result of widening credit spreads, now reflected in Income from other assets, net; and higher fair value losses in our PICC P&C and PICC Group investments. In addition, the three-month period ended September 30, 2014 included our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income, which was accounted for under the equity method through the date of sale of most of our AerCap common shares in the second quarter of 2015. Partially offsetting these declines were lower corporate general operating expenses resulting from a pension curtailment credit and lower interest expense from ongoing liability management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.  Run-off insurance lines reported a pre-tax operating loss of $54 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to pre-tax operating income of $25 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development, as well as an increase in net loss reserve discount charge on excess workers’ compensation. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. During the third quarter of 2015, certain environmental liability and healthcare coverages that were no longer offered by Commercial Insurance, were transferred to Run-off insurance lines, along with associated prior year adverse loss reserve development of $43 million. Corporate and Other Year-to-Date Results Corporate and Other reported a pre-tax operating loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to pre-tax operating income in the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs as a result of widening credit spreads, lower credit valuation adjustments on assets for which the fair value option was elected, and lower mark-to-market income on CDS positions as a result of portfolio wind down and spread widening, all of which are reflected in Income from other assets, net. Partially offsetting these declines were lower corporate general operating expenses      129       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CORPORATE AND OTHER      resulting from a pension curtailment credit and lower interest expense from ongoing liability management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.  Run-off insurance lines reported pre-tax operating income of $37 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to pre-tax operating loss of $23 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher excess workers’ compensation net loss reserve discount benefit, primarily reflecting an increase in Treasury rates in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by an increase in net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development reflecting transfers to run-off insurance lines as discussed above. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion.        INVESTMENTS    Overview         Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for Non-Life Insurance Companies, Life Insurance Companies and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.    Investments Highlights During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     • A widening of credit spreads resulted in a decrease in our net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $13.0 billion as of September 30, 2015 from approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • Although our alternative investments continue to generate higher returns than our fixed maturity securities portfolio, our investment performance tapered in the third quarter of 2015 due to negative performance in the equity markets, which affected the performance of our hedge fund portfolio. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  • Other-than-temporary impairments increased due to impairments within the energy and emerging markets sectors, driven primarily by slowing growth in China and weakness in commodity markets.      Investment Strategies         Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.     130       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Non-Life Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Non-Life Insurance Companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  · While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.  · AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate term investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate term, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.

For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $(39) million and $162 million, respectively. Net investment income decreased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, lower reinvestment yields and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected. Net investment income decreased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to lower income on alternative investments, lower reinvestment yields, and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected. Non-Life Insurance Companies         For the Non-Life Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Non-Life Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The Non-Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Non-Life Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio. The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities. With respect to non-affiliate over‑the‑counter derivatives, the Non-Life Insurance Companies conduct business with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. The Non-Life Insurance Companies have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. The Non-Life Insurance Companies generally use ISDA Master Agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures. Fixed maturity investments of the Non-Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an intermediate duration of 4.7 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as      132       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity investments held in the Non-Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and short to intermediate duration, averaging 3.3 years. Life Insurance Companies         The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life Insurance Companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent possible, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. The Life Insurance Companies investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities and yield enhancing investments. The Life Insurance Companies monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. The Life Insurance Companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. Fixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an intermediate duration of 6.5 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings. Fixed maturity investments held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and intermediate to long duration, averaging 12.9 years. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities         The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to      133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of Life Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments – Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings. The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of Life Insurance Companies categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:    September 30, 2015                                                                                 (in millions)                                                                                                                                                 Total                                     Total                                           Below                                     Investment                                           Investment             NAIC Designation       1       2       Grade           3       4       5       6       Grade       Total     Other fixed maturity securities   $   45,056   $   58,950   $   104,006       $   5,170   $   2,606   $   302   $   139   $   8,217   $   112,223     Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized       40,735       1,920       42,655           382       347       29       945       1,703       44,358     Total*   $   85,791   $   60,870   $   146,661       $   5,552   $   2,953   $   331   $   1,084   $   9,920   $   156,581    * Excludes $4.3 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within Life Insurance Companies that require a statutory filing.

Credit Ratings         At September 30, 2015, approximately 90 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 16 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. A significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2015, approximately 15 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 5 percent were below investment grade or not      134       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      rated. Approximately 43 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Composite AIG Credit Ratings         With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements.     147       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $197 million and $183 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $565 million and $544 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments          The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the third quarter of 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $6.1 billion due primarily to the widening of credit spreads. The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the third quarter of 2014 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. Net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 by $6.5 billion primarily due to the decrease in interest rates and narrowing of spreads.     148       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our investment portfolio.

Gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount. The Non-Life Insurance Companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pre‑tax operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. Net loss reserves represent gross loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance.     149       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      The following table presents the components of net loss reserves:                            September 30,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2015       2014     Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount                       $   74,670   $   80,337     Less: discount                           (3,234)       (3,077)     Gross loss reserves, net of discount, before reinsurance                           71,436       77,260     Less: reinsurance recoverable*                           (13,146)       (15,648)     Net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                       $   58,290   $   61,612    * Includes $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of reinsurance recoverable under a retroactive reinsurance agreement at September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $12.5 billion and $12.4 billion at September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (in excess of high dollar amounts retained by the insured through self-insured retentions, deductibles, retrospective programs, or captive arrangements; each referred to generically as “deductibles”), primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business, where the Non-Life Insurance Companies manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. At September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the Non-Life Insurance Companies held collateral totaling $9.6 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and assets in trusts.

New York rules generally do not permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves. Pennsylvania permits non-tabular discounting of IBNR and, commencing in 2013, approved variable discount rates determined using risk-free rates based on the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin, applicable to IBNR and case reserves. Delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the Pennsylvania domiciled companies. The net decrease in workers’ compensation discount in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, of $77 million was due to a $61 million reduction for accident years 2014 and prior, primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. In addition, decreases in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a $61 million decrease in the loss reserve discount, as Treasury rates as of September 30, 2015 generally decreased along the payout pattern horizon as compared to the prior periods, partially offset by an increase in the credit spread. These decreases were partially offset by the effects of the discount attributable to newly established reserves for accident year 2015, which increased the discount by $45 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The net increase in workers’ compensation discount in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, of $160 million was primarily due to the increase in forward yield curve rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices. The      151       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      increase in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a $222 million increase in the loss reserve discount, as Treasury rates generally increased along the payout pattern horizon in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the effects of the discount attributable to newly established reserves for accident year 2015 increased the discount by $149 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $211 million reduction for accident years 2014 and prior, primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  On January 1, 2014, the Non-Life Insurance Companies merged their two internal pooling arrangements into one pool, and changed the participation percentages of the pool members resulting in a reallocation of reserves from New York domiciled companies to those domiciled in Pennsylvania and Delaware. As a result of these changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool, the Non-Life Insurance Companies recognized a discount benefit of $110 million in the first quarter of 2014. Quarterly Reserving Conclusion         AIG net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of September 30, 2015. While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of September 30, 2015. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a large change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, the adverse prior year loss reserve development was $191 million. This was driven by adverse development from Healthcare, Environmental (2004 - ongoing), and Run-off environmental, partially offset by Property excluding natural catastrophes, both domestically and internationally. The adverse prior year development in Healthcare and Environmental (2004 - ongoing) resulted from indications of the annual detailed valuation review (DVR) performed in the third quarter of 2015 for those lines. Healthcare was driven by deteriorating loss experience in accident years 2008 and subsequent characterized by additional large claims in various segments including hospitals, physicians and surgeons, nursing homes, and pharmaceutical and medical products liability. Environmental was driven by adverse emergence in recent accident years and higher severity assumptions in the most recent accident years. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the adverse prior year loss reserve development was $532 million, which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in Excess and Primary Casualty, as well as adverse development from Healthcare, Environmental (2004 - ongoing), Run-off Environmental, and Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and prior). This was partially offset by Property excluding natural catastrophes, both domestically and internationally. We have observed increases in both the frequency and severity of claims occurring in our primary and excess commercial automobile liability business since the recovery from the recent economic downturn, which have significantly outpaced the rate increases implemented during the same time. We believe a combination of factors are contributing to these increases such as a mix of business weighted towards Excess auto liability for commercial trucking; increased shipping activity potentially resulting in driver fatigue; a greater incidence of claims involving multiple severe injuries and fatalities; and the general increase in damage awards.  We continued to react to these trends as new information emerged, including strengthening reserves during the annual DVR of the commercial automobile liability business in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and through our selection of the current accident year loss ratios. In addition, we made interim increases to reserves in periods between the annual DVR in 2014 and 2015. The experience in accident years 2011 and subsequent has continued to deteriorate and the DVR conducted in the second quarter of 2015 resulted in an increase of commercial automobile liability reserves by $402 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, including $91 million for primary automobile and $311 million for excess automobile, primarily in accident years 2011 through 2014. We recognized return (additional) premiums on loss sensitive business of $30 million and $(93) million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $53 million and $(157) million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which entirely offset development in that business.

As described more fully in the 2014 Annual Report, our reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive ground‑up and top-down analyses performed periodically. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we increased our gross asbestos reserves by $20 million and our net asbestos reserves by $9 million due to minor changes in estimates, accretion of discount, and anticipated uncollectible reinsurance. For the same period, we increased our gross environmental reserves by $66 million and our net environmental reserves by $43 million to reflect the results of a top-down analysis of accident years 1986 and prior completed in the second quarter of 2015. In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, the Non-Life Insurance Companies also have asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non‑U.S. entities of $122 million gross and $96 million net as of September 30, 2015. The asbestos reserves relating to non‑U.S. risks written by non‑U.S. entities were $132 million gross and $105 million net as of December 31, 2014.

Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves         The following section provides discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance reserves for Life Insurance Companies. Update of Actuarial Assumptions   The Life Insurance Companies review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for investment-oriented products at least annually. Estimated gross profit assumptions include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.    In addition to estimated gross profit assumptions, the update of actuarial assumptions in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 included adjustments to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees, group benefit claim reserves and loss recognition for certain long-term care products. The update of assumptions also included adjustments to the valuation of variable annuity GMWB features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of such embedded derivatives are recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) and, together with related DAC adjustments, are excluded from pre-tax operating income.   The net increases (decreases) to pre-tax operating income and pre-tax income as a result of the update of actuarial assumptions for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 are shown in the following tables.     157       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      The following table presents the increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income resulting from the update of actuarial assumptions for the domestic Life Insurance Companies, by product line:    Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30,                     (in millions)       2015       2014     Consumer Insurance:                     Retirement                     Fixed Annuities   $   92   $   196     Retirement Income Solutions       -       14     Group Retirement       48       46     Total Retirement       140       256     Life       (157)       (135)     Total Consumer Insurance       (17)       121     Commercial Insurance:                     Institutional Markets       -       1     Total increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income from update of assumptions       (17)       122    The following table presents the increase (decrease) in pre-tax income resulting from the update of actuarial assumptions of the domestic Life Insurance Companies, by line item as reported in Results of Operations:    Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30,                     (in millions)       2015       2014     Policy fees   $   21   $   27     Interest credited to policyholder account balances       74       93     Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       79       166     Policyholder benefits and losses incurred       (191)       (165)     Increase (decrease) in pre-tax operating income       (17)       121     Change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses)       21       5     Net realized capital gains (losses)       (39)       (32)     Increase (decrease) in pre-tax income   $   (35)   $   94      In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, pre-tax operating income of the Life Insurance Companies in the aggregate was reduced by $17 million as a result of the update of actuarial assumptions. This aggregate net adjustment of $17 million included a net negative adjustment of $157 million in the Life operating segment, which was offset in large part by net positive adjustments in the Retirement operating segment of $92 million in Fixed Annuities and $48 million in Group Retirement.    In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, pre-tax operating income of the Life Insurance Companies in the aggregate was increased by $122 million as a result of the update of assumptions, primarily due to net positive adjustments in the Retirement operating segment from the update of estimated gross profit assumptions in Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement, partially offset by loss recognition for certain long-term care business and additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees in the Life operating segment.   Adjustments related to the update of assumptions for the valuation of variable annuity GMWB features accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value, which are primarily in the Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines, are recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) and excluded from pre-tax operating income. The update of GMWB valuation assumptions in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, including improved mortality, lapse and withdrawal assumptions, resulted in an increase in the GMWB liability. After offsets for related adjustments to DAC, this update of GMWB valuation assumptions reduced pre-tax income by $18 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015.   In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, improved mortality assumptions for variable annuity GMWB embedded derivative liabilities resulted in a net decrease to pre-tax income of $27 million, net of DAC.   A discussion of the adjustments to reflect the update of assumptions for the Retirement and Life operating segments follows.       158       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      Update of Actuarial Assumptions by Operating Segment Retirement The update of actuarial assumptions resulted in net positive adjustments to pre-tax operating earnings of the Retirement operating segment of $140 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and $256 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014. In Fixed Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $92 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, which reflected refinements to investment spread assumptions, lower terminations than previously assumed and decreases to expense assumptions. The three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 included a net positive adjustment of $196 million in Fixed Annuities, primarily due to better spreads than previously assumed. In Retirement Income Solutions, there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees, modeled expenses, and terminations, resulting in no net adjustment to pre-tax operating earnings in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, compared to a $14 million net positive adjustment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to the update of mortality assumptions. In Group Retirement, a net positive adjustment from the update of estimated gross profit assumptions of $48 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to revisions to mortality and surrender assumptions, partially offset by decreased spread assumptions. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, a net positive adjustment in Group Retirement was primarily due to more favorable assumptions for investment spreads and surrenders than previously assumed. Adjustments related to the update of assumptions for the valuation of variable annuity GMWB features accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value, which primarily relate to the Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines, are recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) and excluded from pre-tax operating income. See Update of Actuarial Assumptions above for discussion of these adjustments.   Life The net negative adjustment of $157 million related to the update of the actuarial assumptions, which reduced pre-tax operating income of the Life operating segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to lower assumed surrender rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees, which represent approximately eight percent of total U.S. life reserves. The net negative adjustment also reflected lower investment spread assumptions, partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality, as well as loss recognition expense of $39 million for certain discontinued long-term care products primarily due to lower future premium assumptions. These negative adjustments were partially offset by a decrease in certain Group Benefit claim reserves based on updated experience data. A net negative adjustment of $135 million in the Life operating segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 also included additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees, primarily due to lower investment spread and mortality assumptions which, while higher than previously assumed, were still within pricing assumptions, as well as loss recognition expense. The Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $39 million and $87 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which reduced pre-tax operating income in the respective periods, to increase reserves for certain long-term care business. Loss recognition expense is included in Other reserve changes in the rollforward table presented in Insurance Reserves. The loss recognition for both periods was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, in the 2014 period but to a lesser extent, lower yield assumptions. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could result in additional loss recognition reserves. While the domestic Life Insurance Companies do not currently offer standalone long-     159       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      term care products, these needs are addressed with various benefits and riders in the existing portfolio, such as chronic illness riders. DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in Life Insurance Companies DAC, including VOBA:    Nine Months Ended September 30,                             (in millions)               2015       2014     Balance, beginning of year           $   7,258   $   6,920     Acquisition costs deferred               935       819     Amortization expense:                             Update of assumptions included in pre-tax operating income               79       167     Related to realized capital gains and losses               (65)       (48)     All other operating amortization               (746)       (624)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange               (32)       (6)     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments               464       (361)     Balance, end of period*           $   7,893   $   6,867    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $8.9 billion and $8.3 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net adjustments to DAC amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented one percent and two percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). The change in shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio. In addition, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). Market interest rates increased as a result of widening spreads in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. As a result, the Life Insurance Companies’ unrealized appreciation of investments in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased by $4.4 billion compared to December 31, 2014, which resulted in an increase in shadow DAC and a decrease in shadow loss reserves. Shadow loss reserves were $304 million at September 30, 2015 compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014.     160       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      Life Insurance Companies Reserves         The following table presents a rollforward of Life Insurance Companies’ insurance reserves, including separate accounts and mutual fund assets under management, by operating segment:        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended         September 30,       September 30,     (in millions)       2015           2014           2015       2014     Institutional Markets:                                             Balance at beginning of period, gross   $   35,523       $   32,386       $   35,080   $   32,100     Premiums and deposits       159           2,840           985       3,182     Surrenders and withdrawals       (133)           (343)           (389)       (428)     Death and other contract benefits       (396)           (365)           (1,193)       (1,117)     Subtotal       (370)           2,132           (597)       1,637     Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of                                             policy fees       206           184           763       833     Cost of funds       102           105           306       308     Other reserve changes       (61)           (42)           (152)       (113)     Balance at end of period       35,400           34,765           35,400       34,765     Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments       288           752           288       752     Reinsurance ceded       (5)           (6)           (5)       (6)     Total insurance reserves   $   35,683       $   35,511       $   35,683   $   35,511     Retirement:                                             Balance at beginning of period, gross   $   207,868       $   203,264       $   204,627   $   195,493     Premiums and deposits       6,639           5,876           18,244       18,074     Surrenders and withdrawals       (4,767)           (5,208)           (13,433)       (13,941)     Death and other contract benefits       (997)           (953)           (2,965)       (2,775)     Subtotal       875           (285)           1,846       1,358     Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of                                             policy fees       (5,754)           (1,137)           (4,862)       3,562     Cost of funds       688           698           2,037       2,087     Other reserve changes       15           21           44       61     Balance at end of period       203,692           202,561           203,692       202,561     Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments        15           85           15       85     Reinsurance ceded       (363)           (356)           (363)       (356)     Total insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management   $   203,344       $   202,290       $   203,344   $   202,290     Life:                                             Balance at beginning of period, gross   $   33,640       $   33,086       $   33,536   $   32,810     Premiums and deposits       1,223           1,163           3,695       3,557     Surrenders and withdrawals       (189)           (211)           (575)       (638)     Death and other contract benefits       (257)           (224)           (764)       (608)     Subtotal       777           728           2,356       2,311     Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of                                             policy fees       (266)           (195)           (594)       (530)     Cost of funds       124           126           370       378     Other reserve changes       (436)           (327)           (1,829)       (1,551)     Balance at end of period       33,839           33,418           33,839       33,418     Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments        1           -

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    Overview         Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement in the 2014 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.      162       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.

The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $1.1 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to $2.6 billion in the same period in the prior year. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $3.3 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 and $7.0 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. Cash used in operating activities of our Non-Life Insurance Companies in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was $172 million compared to $1.2 billion of cash provided in the same period of the prior year, primarily attributable to increases in loss payments in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities of our Life Insurance Companies was $2.1 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, compared to cash provided of $2.6 billion in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Investing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash provided by investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 included: • approximately $0.7 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by our Life Insurance Companies; and • approximately $4.2 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares of AerCap.     165       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Net cash provided by investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 included: • approximately $1.0 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by our Life Insurance Companies; and • approximately $2.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ILFC. Financing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash used in financing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 included: • approximately $687 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2015 and $0.28 per share on AIG Common Stock in the third quarter of 2015; • approximately $7.5 billion to repurchase approximately 129 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $8.3 billion to repay long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 included: • approximately $539 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2014; • approximately $3.4 billion to repurchase approximately 60 million shares of AIG Common Stock; • approximately $271 million to repay long-term debt of business held-for-sale; and • approximately $11.3 billion to repay long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries         AIG Parent         As of September 30, 2015, AIG Parent had approximately $15.7 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity sources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. We generally manage capital flows between AIG Parent and its subsidiaries through internal, Board‑approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.      166       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that capital associated with businesses or investments that do not directly support our insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.  In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the capital resources available to support our insurance operations and business strategies, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, expectations for capital generation, rating agency expectations for capital, as well as regulatory standards for capital and capital distributions. The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   September 30, 2015   December 31, 2014     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   4,816   $   5,085     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       6,387       4,727     Total AIG Parent liquidity       11,203       9,812     Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(c)       4,000       4,000     Available capacity under contingent liquidity facility(d)       500       500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   15,703   $   14,312    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $2.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. (c) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see Credit Facilities below. (d) For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facility, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below. Non-Life Insurance Companies         We expect that our Non-Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Certain Non-Life Insurance Companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs may be used to supplement liquidity. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, none of our Non-Life Insurance Companies had FHLB borrowings outstanding.  Our Non-Life Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.     167       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In April 2015, AIG Parent and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL), a Non-Life Insurance Company, entered into a new $725 million letter of credit facility, which replaced the prior $625 million letter of credit facility. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd’s of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd’s), is required to hold capital at Lloyd’s, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, the entire FAL capital requirement of $625 million as of September 30, 2015, which supports the 2015, 2016 and 2017 years of account, was satisfied with a letter of credit in that amount issued under the facility. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Non-Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with a Mortgage Guaranty insurance company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to its board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of September 30, 2015, the minimum required capital for the CMA with the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 19 to 1.  In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $2.7 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent, of which $600 million represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our Non-Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014. The fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.  Life Insurance Companies         We expect that our Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Life Insurance Companies hold liquidity resources in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Certain of our domestic Life Insurance Companies are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our domestic Life Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of $27 million and $44 million as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a potential liquidity requirement for our Life Insurance Companies. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Our Life Insurance Companies also have developed a contingent liquidity plan to address unforeseen liquidity needs. Certain of our domestic Life Insurance Companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these domestic Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. At September 30, 2015, our domestic Life Insurance Companies had $981 million of securities subject to these agreements and $1.0 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral      168       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      received. Our domestic Life Insurance Companies had no securities subject to lending agreements and no collateral liability at December 31, 2014. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of AGC Life Insurance Company at or above a specified minimum percentage of its projected NAIC Company Action Level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). As of September 30, 2015, the specified minimum percentage under this CMA was 250 percent. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, our domestic Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $4.6 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent, of which $2.2 billion represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our domestic operating Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014. The fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. Credit Facilities         We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Five-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Five-Year Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.0 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2019. As of September 30, 2015, a total of $4.0 billion remains available under the Five-Year Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Five-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Five-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.   Contingent Liquidity Facilities         AIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.  Our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.      169       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Contractual Obligations         The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:    September 30, 2015               Payments due by Period              Total       Remainder       2016 -       2018 -                     (in millions)       Payments        of 2015       2017       2019       2020       Thereafter     Insurance operations                                                     Loss reserves   $   74,670   $   5,666   $   28,897   $   14,509   $   4,538   $   21,060     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       225,824       3,737       28,529       25,597       11,873       156,088     Borrowings       813       -       -       -       107       706     Interest payments on borrowings       1,144       3       109       109       54       869     Other long-term obligations       16       1       10       3       2       -     Total   $   302,467   $   9,407   $   57,545   $   40,218   $   16,574   $   178,723     Other                                                      Borrowings   $   24,782   $   1,062   $   2,824   $   3,065   $   1,387   $   16,444     Interest payments on borrowings       17,488       220       2,160       1,869       866       12,373     Other long-term obligations       120       8       7       2       -       103     Total   $   42,390   $   1,290   $   4,991   $   4,936   $   2,253   $   28,920     Consolidated                                                     Loss reserves   $   74,670   $   5,666   $   28,897   $   14,509   $   4,538   $   21,060     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       225,824       3,737       28,529       25,597       11,873       156,088     Borrowings       25,595       1,062       2,824       3,065       1,494       17,150     Interest payments on borrowings       18,632       223       2,269       1,978       920       13,242     Other long-term obligations(a)       136       9       17       5       2       103     Total(b)   $   344,857   $   10,697   $   62,536   $   45,154   $   18,827   $   207,643    (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.  Loss Reserves         Loss reserves relate to our Non-Life Insurance Companies and represent future losses and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our Non-Life Insurance Companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities         Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life Insurance Companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts      170       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life Insurance Companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life Insurance Companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.  Borrowings         Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Includes a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility) scheduled to mature in May 2019. The AerCap Credit Facility permits loans for general corporate purposes. In June 2015, upon the receipt by AIG Parent of the $500 million principal amount of 6.50% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes issued by AerCap Global Aviation Trust, the aggregate commitment under the AerCap Credit Facility was reduced to $500 million from $1.0 billion. At September 30, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility. (f) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining annual pension contribution for 2015 is expected to be approximately $14 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities          We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements         We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.       172       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Debt         The following table provides the rollforward of AIG’s total debt outstanding:            Balance at               Maturities       Effect of                   Balance at     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015       December 31,               and       Foreign       Other       September 30,     (in millions)       2014       Issuances   Repayments       Exchange       Changes           2015     Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                                         AIG general borrowings:                                                         Notes and bonds payable   $   15,570   $   5,540   $   (2,981)   $   (112)   $   8       $   18,025     Subordinated debt       250       -       (250)       -       -           -     Junior subordinated debt       2,466       -       (1,073)       (49)       1           1,345     Loans and mortgages payable       -       109       -       (2)       -           107     AIGLH notes and bonds payable       284       -       -       -       -           284     AIGLH junior subordinated debt       536       -       (114)       -       -           422     Total AIG general borrowings       19,106       5,649       (4,418)       (163)       9           20,183     AIG borrowings supported by assets:(a)                                                         MIP notes payable       2,870       -       (1,422)       -       (57)           1,391     Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable       34       -       (2)       -       4           36     GIAs, at fair value       4,648       304       (1,501)       -       91   (b)       3,542     Notes and bonds payable, at fair value       818       10       (388)       -       3   (b)       443     Total AIG borrowings supported by assets       8,370       314       (3,313)       -       41           5,412     Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG       27,476       5,963       (7,731)       (163)       50           25,595     Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                                         Other subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and                                                         mortgages payable       58       301       (379)       (1)       49           28     Debt of consolidated investments(c)       3,683       226       (364)       (90)       1,641   (d)       5,096     Total debt not guaranteed by AIG       3,741       527       (743)       (91)       1,690           5,124     Total debt   $   31,217   $   6,490   $   (8,474)   $   (254)   $   1,740       $   30,719    (a) AIG Parent guarantees all such debt, except for MIP notes payable and Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable, which are direct obligations of AIG Parent.

(d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.     175       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early. The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity, Capital and Credit in our 2014 Annual Report.  Regulation and Supervision         For a discussion of our regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, including with respect to our liquidity and capital resources, see Item 1. Business — Regulation and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation in our 2014 Annual Report and Item 2. MD&A – Regulatory Environment in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock     On February 12, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on March 26, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2015. On April 30, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on June 25, 2015 to shareholders of record on June 11, 2015. On August 3, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.28 per share, payable on September 28, 2015 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2015. On November 2, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.28 per share, payable on December 21, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 7, 2015. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On August 3, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $5.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization. As of October 31, 2015, approximately $2.9 billion remained under the share repurchase authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased approximately 129 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.5 billion pursuant to this authorization. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 3.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in January 2015 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 plan, from October 1 to October 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $602 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.         176       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Dividend Restrictions         Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries.      ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT    Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview         We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2014 Annual Report. Credit Risk Management         Overview         Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data.      177       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      See Investments – Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures. Market Risk Management         Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for properly identifying these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Risk Identification         Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital. Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk: Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, and residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.  Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and resulting product changes will generally reduce the attractiveness of our insurance products in the marketplace. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric U.S. GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts. Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the long‑term. In      178       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit‑worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses. Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.  Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels. Risk Measurement         Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specific stress tests. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis. In addition, we continue to enhance economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.    We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:     Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in price on equity securities. Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets. Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses. Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.        179       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Market Risk Sensitivities         The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:        Balance Sheet Exposure               Balance Sheet Effect         September 30,       December 31,               September 30,       December 31,      (dollars in millions)       2015           2014                   2015           2014     Sensitivity factor                                    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves     Interest rate sensitive assets:                                                         Fixed maturity securities       264,795           273,885                   (14,567)           (15,107)     Mortgage and other loans receivable       18,313           16,594                   (1,024)           (921)     Preferred stock       21           19                   (3)           (1)     Total interest rate sensitive assets   $   283,129   (a)   $   290,498   (a)            $   (15,594)       $   (16,029)     Sensitivity factor                                    20% decline in stock prices and value of                                         alternative investments     Equity and alternative investments exposure:                                                         Hedge funds       11,180           10,798                   (2,236)           (2,160)     Private equity       8,016           8,858                   (1,603)           (1,772)     Real estate investments       6,570           3,612                   (1,314)           (722)     PICC(b)        2,897           3,375                   (579)           (675)     Common equity       1,938           2,044                   (388)           (409)     Aircraft asset investments       583           651                   (117)           (130)     AerCap(c)        -           4,972                   -           (994)     Other investments       492           1,331                   (98)           (266)     Total equity and alternative investments                                                          exposure   $   31,676       $   35,641               $   (6,335)       $   (7,128)     Sensitivity factor                                    10% depreciation of all foreign currency                                          exchange rates against the U.S. dollar     Foreign currency-denominated net                                                          asset position(d)   $   13,008       $   12,005               $   (1,301)       $   (1,201)    (a) At September 30, 2015, the analysis covered $283.1 billion of $302.3 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $9.9 billion of loans and $3.8 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.5 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2014, the analysis covered $290.4 billion of $308.9 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.4 billion of loans and $3.8 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $6.3 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.  (b) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C. (c) In September 2015, we sold the remainder of our ordinary shares of AerCap. Our 2014 sensitivity calculation for AerCap was based on our carrying value rather than the stock price as of the applicable date, as we applied the equity method of accounting prior to the sale.  (d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries. However, we may utilize either cross-currency swaps or our foreign currency- denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries.  At September 30, 2015, our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in British pounds, Canadian dollars, euro, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese yen. Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at September 30, 2015, increased by $1.0 billion, or 8.4 percent, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was mostly due to a $1.5 billion increase in our euro position, primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging; a $671 million increase in our Japanese      180       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      yen position, primarily resulting from debt hedging and unrealized appreciation of investments; a $593 million increase in our Hong Kong dollar position primarily resulting from the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ investment in PICC P&C; and a $186 million increase in our Swiss franc position, primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging. These increases were partially offset by a $1.5 billion decrease in our British pound position, primarily resulting from the unwinding of a cross-currency swap; and a $448 million decrease in our Canadian dollar position, primarily resulting from dividend hedging.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management         Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.  AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period of up to one year. We maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements. Risk Identification         The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.  • Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.  • Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls. • Event Funding Risk: Additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.  • Financing Risk: We are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding. Risk Measurement         Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.     181       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT         We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:     Coverage Ratios: Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of a portfolio of assets to meet the forecasted net cash flow over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.  Asset Ratios: Asset Ratios measure and track the quality of an entity’s assets that can be used to raise liquidity over a specified period of time.  Cash Flow Forecasts: Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon. Stress Testing: Coverage Ratios and Asset Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.    Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:     • income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset; • liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses; • reinsurance assets; • valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; • valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; • estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; • impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on investments in life settlements and goodwill impairment; • liability for legal contingencies; and • fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, you should read Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2014 Annual Report.      182       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT           REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT    Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. AIG is regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) due to its designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a nonbank SIFI. As a nonbank SIFI, AIG is required each year to submit to the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) a plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which must meet several specific requirements, including identifying material entities and core business lines, setting forth a detailed resolution strategy, and providing detailed information regarding its organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, global cooperation, adequate funding and liquidity, and management information systems, among other elements. On March 26, 2015, the FRB and the FDIC permanently adjusted the annual resolution plan filing deadline for designated nonbank SIFIs, including AIG, from July 1 to December 31 of each year beginning in 2016. The agencies previously granted a temporary extension of the 2015 resolution plan deadline for designated nonbank SIFIs, including AIG, from July 1 to December 31, 2015. The FRB has yet to complete the regulatory and capital framework that will be applicable to AIG as a nonbank SIFI. In October 2015, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) announced that it had concluded initial development of the Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) requirements for global systemically important insurers. The HLA standards, which when fully developed are scheduled to come into effect in January 2019, have been endorsed by the Financial Stability Board and are expected to be formally adopted by the IAIS and endorsed by G-20 leaders in November 2015. Other related IAIS initiatives, including final development of the HLA standards, are pending. Standards issued by the IAIS are not binding on U.S. insurers or insurance groups unless and until U.S. federal or state regulators adopt appropriate regulations. At this time it is not known how the HLA requirements might be implemented in the U.S. or how they might apply to AIG. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report.     183       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY         GLOSSARY      Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting, and the change in DAC. Acquisition costs that are incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are deferred and recognized over the coverage periods of related insurance contracts. Acquisition costs that are not incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are recognized as incurred.  Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected.

There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.      188     TABLE OF CONTENTS           PART II – OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1 / Legal Proceedings         For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1A./ Risk Factors         In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the following risk factor as well as the other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2014 Annual Report. Our restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational and organizational efficiency. We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements we expect to result from our restructuring initiatives. Actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement them. The successful implementation of these initiatives will require us to effect workforce reductions, business rationalizations, systems enhancements and business dispositions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to realize these anticipated expense reductions and efficiency improvements, our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected.
