Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K).    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   In addition to reviewing AIG's results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, to reflect developments in or affecting AIG's business to date during 2010.   Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. Underwriting profit (loss) is utilized to report results for AIG's General Insurance operations and pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is utilized to report results for AIG's life insurance and retirement services operations as these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.   AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.     Executive Overview    AIG reports the results of its operations through four reportable segments: General Insurance, Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, and Financial Services.    •General Insurance — branded as Chartis in 2009, is comprised of multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad.   •Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services — branded as SunAmerica Financial Group in 2009. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance, and group life and health products. In addition, Domestic Life Insurance offers a variety of payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Domestic Retirement Services businesses offer group retirement products and individual fixed and variable annuities. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and other fixed and variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. Domestic Retirement Services also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were written in (or issued to) the institutional market place prior to 2006.   •Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — provides individual insurance and investment-oriented products such as term and whole life, endowments, term and whole life medical, cancer, fixed annuities and group products including life, medical and pension. Following the classification of AIA Group Limited (AIA), American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), and Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) as discontinued operations (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the   88      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   reclassification of certain immaterial non-core entities to Other non-core operations, AIG's remaining Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations are conducted in Japan through AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Ltd and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company.    •Financial Services — engages in diversified activities, including commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations, consumer finance and insurance premium financing, both in the United States and abroad.      Priorities for 2010   AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2010:    •continuing the stabilization and strengthening of AIG's businesses;   •realizing additional progress in restructuring and asset disposition initiatives to enable repayment of amounts outstanding under the FRBNY credit facility (the FRBNY Credit Facility) provided by the FRBNY under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Agreement), between AIG and the FRBNY;   •closing the pending sales transactions for AIA, ALICO and Nan Shan and implementing plans to monetize securities expected to be received upon the AIA and ALICO closings;   •beginning to address its highly leveraged capital structure;   •continuing the wind-down of AIG's exposure to certain financial products and derivatives trading activities; and   •continuing to address the long-term financing needs of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and American General Finance, Inc. (AGF).      2010 Financial Overview   The continued improvement in the financial markets contributed significantly to AIG's income from continuing operations before income taxes, which amounted to $835 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $6.5 billion in the same period of 2009, as evidenced by the following:    •growth in net investment income primarily related to gains on AIG's interests in Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III which totaled $911 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to losses of $2.2 billion in the same period of 2009, and increased income from partnership investments reflecting improvement in the equity markets;   •a decline in other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities due to the improved market conditions. The 2009 period included non-credit impairments (i.e., severity losses) that are no longer required for fixed maturity securities upon adoption of a new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard commencing in the second quarter of 2009. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Investments — Evaluating Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments for more information on this accounting standard;   •a reduction in losses for Capital Markets as lower unwind costs and a decline in Unrealized market valuation losses related to AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio more than offset a decline in net credit valuation adjustment gains on AIGFP's assets and liabilities; and   •A significant improvement in earnings for the Mortgage Guaranty business.    Negatively impacting first quarter 2010 results were $481 million of catastrophe losses in General Insurance primarily related to the Chile earthquake, U.S. wind storms and Madeira (Portugal) floods.  89      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries     2010 Business Outlook   The following discussion supplements and updates the Business Outlook contained in AIG's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     General Insurance    On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Chartis International subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji), a publicly traded Japanese insurance company with general insurance and some life operations. Fuji's financial information is reported on a one-quarter lag. As a result, Fuji's results will be consolidated beginning in the third quarter of 2010, and will be reported in the Foreign General Insurance operating segment. Further, AIG has not completed the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and, as a result, recorded an unallocated purchase price liability. Upon final determination of fair values, AIG may recognize a bargain purchase gain, which could be substantial. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma results and additional information about the terms of the acquisition.   On April 20, 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig, operating in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, resulted in a fire that sank the rig and caused a massive-scale oil spill. AIG estimates that its exposure to property loss on this event was approximately $20 million, which has been paid. It will not be possible to estimate the amount of casualty loss associated with this event, if any, until the determination of the cause and responsibility for the explosion and resulting oil spill and the assessment of damages resulting from the oil spill, as well as other factors, have been resolved. Therefore, although AIG cannot currently quantify its ultimate liabilities arising from this event, it is possible that such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows for an individual reporting period.     Divestitures    In connection with the announced sale of ALICO on March 7, 2010 and management's decision that ALICO met the held-for-sale criteria on March 31, 2010, total goodwill of $4.6 billion associated with the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Japan & Other reporting unit was allocated among ALICO and the Japan & Other businesses to be retained based on their relative fair values as of March 31, 2010. This resulted in $3.3 billion and $1.3 billion of goodwill being allocated to ALICO and the retained businesses, respectively. Future changes in any of the assumptions used to measure the fair value of the ALICO reporting unit could result in a potential impairment of the goodwill allocated to ALICO of up to $3.3 billion, which would be reported in Income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances, including ALICO's operating results and the performance of MetLife, Inc.'s (MetLife) common stock, that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Goodwill Impairment for additional information.   AIG and AIA are working closely with Prudential to complete the sale of AIA, which AIG expects will close in 2010. Upon closing, AIG expects to realize a significant gain on the transaction, which will be reported in Income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).     Mortgage Guaranty    The improvement in UGC's results is primarily the result of lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in both the first and second-lien products, higher cure rates on existing first-lien delinquent loans, the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies, increased rescission activity on domestic first- and second-lien claims and increased efforts to modify payment plans for currently delinquent loans. If these trends continue, UGC's financial results may show improvement in future quarters. However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the longer term outlook for the housing market, U.S. unemployment rates, the impact of future  90      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  foreclosures on domestic home prices, loan modification programs and mortgage insurance rescission rates and the effects, if any, these factors will have on UGC's financial results.     Significant Events in 2010     AIA Sale    As of March 1, 2010, AIG and AIA Aurora LLC, a special purpose vehicle formed by AIG and the FRBNY (AIA Holdings), entered into a definitive agreement (the AIA Share Purchase Agreement) with Prudential plc (Prudential) and Prudential Group Limited (formerly known as Petrohue (UK) Investments Limited), for the sale of AIA to Prudential Group Limited for approximately $35.5 billion, consisting of $25 billion in cash, approximately $5.5 billion in face value of ordinary shares in the capital of Prudential Group Limited, $3 billion in face value of mandatory convertible securities of Prudential Group Limited, and $2 billion in face value of preferred stock of Prudential (or at Prudential's election, Prudential Group Limited), subject to closing adjustments. The obligations of Prudential Group Limited under the AIA Share Purchase Agreement are guaranteed by Prudential.   The cash portion of the proceeds from the sale will be paid to the FRBNY to redeem preferred interests with a liquidation preference of approximately $16 billion plus accrued but unpaid preferred return held by the FRBNY in AIA Holdings, and unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, to repay approximately $9 billion under the FRBNY Credit Facility. AIG intends to monetize the $10.5 billion in face value of Prudential Group Limited securities over time, subject to market conditions, following the lapse of agreed-upon minimum holding periods. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net cash proceeds from the monetization of these securities will be used to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility.     ALICO Sale    As of March 7, 2010, AIG and ALICO Holdings LLC, a special purpose vehicle formed by AIG and the FRBNY (ALICO Holdings) entered into a definitive agreement (the ALICO Stock Purchase Agreement) with MetLife for the sale of ALICO by ALICO Holdings to MetLife, and the sale of Delaware American Life Insurance Company by AIG to MetLife, for approximately $15.5 billion, consisting of $6.8 billion in cash and the remainder in equity securities of MetLife, subject to closing adjustments.   The cash portion of the proceeds from this sale will be paid to the FRBNY to reduce the liquidation preference of a portion of the preferred interests owned by the FRBNY in ALICO Holdings (together with the preferred interests owned by the FRBNY in AIA Holdings, the Preferred Interests). Upon the closing of this sale to MetLife, ALICO Holdings will receive and pay to the FRBNY the cash consideration and will hold the remainder of the transaction consideration, consisting of 78,239,712 shares of MetLife common stock, 6,857,000 shares of newly issued participating preferred stock convertible into 68,570,000 shares of common stock upon the approval of MetLife shareholders, and 40,000,000 equity units of MetLife with an aggregate stated value of $3 billion. AIG intends to monetize these MetLife securities over time, subject to market conditions, following the lapse of agreed-upon minimum holding periods. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net cash proceeds from the monetization of these securities will be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the Preferred Interests owned by the FRBNY in ALICO Holdings and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility.     Retained Financial Interest    In the case of the sales of AIA and ALICO, the value of the securities consideration is subject to fluctuation from the date of signing of the AIA Share Purchase Agreement or the ALICO Stock Purchase Agreement, as the case may be, through closing of each sale until the ultimate monetization by AIG of the Prudential Group Limited securities and the MetLife securities. These fluctuations will be influenced by market prices of Prudential Group Limited securities and MetLife securities generally, and the market prices of Prudential Group Limited ordinary shares and MetLife common stock in particular, which will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of Prudential and MetLife. AIG is subject in  91      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  each case to agreed-upon minimum holding periods that also restrict AIG's ability to enter into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of the securities consideration. These minimum holding periods and hedging restrictions cannot be altered without the consent of Prudential or MetLife, as the case may be, so AIG will bear the risk of these market price fluctuations during the applicable holding periods. The amount of any gain or loss recognized by AIG upon each sale will depend upon the fair value of the securities consideration received as of closing and the proceeds received by AIG from the monetization of the securities. This may also result in AIG realizing ultimate cash proceeds from the monetization of the securities consideration that is substantially less than what might be expected from the value of such consideration as of the date of signing of the relevant purchase agreement. During the holding period, AIG will carry these securities as available-for-sale investments, with changes in the fair value of the securities recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).   For a discussion of risks surrounding the AIA and ALICO transactions, see Item 1A. — Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     ILFC and AGF Liquidity    During the first four months of 2010, ILFC and AGF made substantial progress in addressing their liquidity needs. During March and April of 2010, ILFC significantly increased its liquidity position through a combination of new secured and unsecured debt issuances of approximately $4.0 billion and an extension of the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Availability of $550 million of the approximately $4.0 billion of debt issuances and the extension of the $2.16 billion revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. In addition, in April 2010, ILFC signed an agreement to sell 53 aircraft, with an aggregate book value of approximately $2.3 billion, which is expected to generate approximately $2.0 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. As of March 31, 2010, none of these aircraft met the criteria to be recorded as held for sale. During March and April of 2010, AGF significantly enhanced its liquidity position through the following actions: AGF received cash proceeds of more than $500 million from a $1.0 billion asset securitization in March 2010 and executed and drew down fully a $3.0 billion secured term loan transaction in April 2010. AGF used a portion of the proceeds from these transactions, cash on hand and proceeds from AIG's repayment of two demand promissory notes to repay all of its outstanding obligations under its $2.45 billion one-year term loans in March 2010 and its $2.125 billion five-year revolving credit facility in April 2010 (both of which were due in July 2010). See Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity — Financial Services for a further discussion.     Sale of Interest in Transatlantic    On March 15, 2010, AIG closed a secondary public offering of 8,466,693 shares of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic) common stock owned by American Home Assurance Company, a subsidiary of AIG, for aggregate gross proceeds of $452 million.     Consideration of AIG's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management has assessed whether AIG has the ability to continue as a going concern. In making this assessment, AIG has considered:    •The commitment of the U.S. government to continue to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due;   •AIG's liquidity-related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •The additional capital provided or committed through the Department of the Treasury Commitment (as defined below under Department of the Treasury Commitment);   •The provisions of the definitive agreements for the sales of AIA and ALICO;   92      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   •The level of AIG's realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders' equity and on the capital levels of AIG's insurance subsidiaries;   •The continuing liquidity needs in certain of AIG's businesses and AIG's actions to address such needs; and   •The substantial risks to which AIG is subject.    In considering these items, management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of AIG's risks and uncertainties. Management also assessed other items and risks arising in AIG's businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto. After consideration, management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG's businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.   It is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management's plans could be materially different or that one or more of management's significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of the risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. If one or more of these possible outcomes is realized and third party financing is not available, AIG may need additional U.S. government support to meet its obligations as they come due. Under these adverse assumptions, if additional support is not available in such circumstances, there could exist substantial doubt about AIG's ability to operate as a going concern.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding going concern considerations.     Capital Resources and Liquidity     Liquidity     Overview    AIG manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels. AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months. AIG expects that dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries will support its liquidity needs; the FRBNY Credit Facility is also expected to continue to be a primary source of liquidity. In addition, the Department of the Treasury Commitment may also be used as a source of funding, primarily to support the capital needs of AIG's insurance company subsidiaries. AIG expects that its primary uses of available cash will be debt service and subsidiary funding. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net proceeds from the sales of operations and assets are expected to be used to pay the Preferred Interests and to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses, settlement of intercompany loan facilities, and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes.   At March 31, 2010, remaining amounts available under the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury Commitment were $12.5 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively, compared to $17.1 billion and $24.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009.   Net borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility increased by approximately $1.5 billion from March 31, 2010 to April 28, 2010. The proceeds were primarily used to repay $2.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding under the FRBNY Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) for Curzon Funding LLC and Nightingale Finance LLC (Nightingale) on April 26, 2010.  93                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       FRBNY Credit Facility   The following table presents changes in net borrowings outstanding and the remaining available amount that can be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility:                      Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 (in millions)                Net borrowings outstanding, January 1, 2010   $ 17,900        Loans to AIGFP for collateral postings, GIA and other maturities     700        AIGFP repayments to AIG     (454 )      Debt payments     1,615        AIG Funding commercial paper maturities     2,000        Dividends from subsidiaries     (256 )      Return of deposit to AGF     1,550        Net cash proceeds from asset sales applied as mandatory prepayments     (844 )      Other borrowings and repayments, net     (562 )          Net borrowings outstanding, March 31, 2010     21,649      Accrued compounding interest and fees inception through December 31, 2009     5,535      Accrued compounding interest and fees January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010*     216            Total balance outstanding, March 31, 2010   $ 27,400            Total FRBNY Credit Facility, January 1, 2010   $ 35,000        Mandatory prepayments     (844 )          Total FRBNY Credit Facility, March 31, 2010   $ 34,156        Less: borrowings outstanding, March 31, 2010     (21,649 )          Remaining available amount, March 31, 2010   $ 12,507               *Excludes interest payable of $3 million at March 31, 2010, which was included in Other liabilities.       Department of the Treasury Commitment    On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which (i) AIG issued to the Department of the Treasury (a) 300,000 shares of AIG Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series F Preferred Stock), and (b) a warrant to purchase 150 shares of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, and (ii) the Department of the Treasury agreed to provide up to $29.835 billion (Department of the Treasury Commitment) in exchange for increases in the liquidation preference of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.  The following table presents changes in drawdowns and the remaining available amount under the Department of the Treasury Commitment:                      Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 (in millions)                Total drawdowns, January 1, 2010   $ 5,344        Redemption and repurchase of securities held by insurance subsidiaries     2,148        UGC related restructuring transactions     48        Temporary repayment of FRBNY Credit Facility     3            Total drawdowns, March 31, 2010   $ 7,543            Total Department of the Treasury commitment, January 1, 2010   $ 29,835        Less: drawdowns, March 31, 2010     (7,543 )          Remaining available amount, March 31, 2010   $ 22,292             94      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Additional details regarding liquidity sources are included in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries below.       AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due    Future Cash Requirements   AIG expects that the repayment of future debt maturities and the payment of the preferred returns and liquidation preference on the Preferred Interests will be its primary uses of available cash. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, the net proceeds from the cash consideration and the monetization of the securities consideration from the sales of AIA and ALICO will first be used to pay the Preferred Interests, and then to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility.  The following table summarizes the maturing debt at March 31, 2010 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                 (in millions)   Second Quarter 2010   Third Quarter 2010   Fourth Quarter 2010   First Quarter 2011   Total            ILFC   $ 1,485   $ 2,003   $ 2,501   $ 1,642   $ 7,631      AGF     659     2,797     210     679     4,345      AIG Matched Investment Program     -     888     776     -     1,664      AIGFP     600     270     269     189     1,328      AIG     -     -     500     12     512      Other     19     511     7     6     543            Total   $ 2,763   $ 6,469   $ 4,263   $ 2,528   $ 16,023              AIG's plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows:    •ILFC's sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales (see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC below). During March and April of 2010, ILFC significantly enhanced its liquidity position through a combination of new secured and unsecured debt issuances of approximately $4.0 billion and an extension of the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Availability of $550 million of the approximate $4.0 billion of debt issuances and the extension of $2.16 billion of the revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. In addition, in April 2010, ILFC signed an agreement to sell 53 aircraft, with an aggregate book value of approximately $2.3 billion, which is expected to generate approximately $2.0 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. Based on this level of increased liquidity and expected future sources of funding, including future cash flows from operations and potential aircraft sales, AIG now expects that ILFC will be able to meet its existing obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months solely from its own future cash flows. Therefore, while AIG has acknowledged its intent to support ILFC through February 28, 2011, at the current time AIG believes that any further extension of such support will not be necessary.   •AGF anticipates that its primary sources of liquidity will be customer receivable collections, additional on-balance sheet securitizations, portfolio sales and borrowings (see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — AGF below). During March and April of 2010, AGF significantly enhanced its liquidity position through the following actions: AGF received cash proceeds of more than $500 million from a $1.0 billion asset securitization in March 2010 and executed and fully drew down a $3.0 billion secured term loan transaction in April 2010. AGF used a portion of the proceeds from these transactions, cash on hand and proceeds from AIG's repayment of two demand promissory notes to repay all of its outstanding obligations under its $2.45 billion one-year term loans in March 2010 and its $2.125 billion five-year revolving credit facility in April 2010 (both of which were due in July 2010). Based on this level of increased   95      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   liquidity and expected future sources of funding, including future cash flows from operations, AIG now expects that AGF will be able to meet its existing obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months solely from its own future cash flows. Therefore, while AIG has acknowledged its intent to support AGF through February 28, 2011, at the current time AIG believes that any further extension of such support will not be necessary. AIG is continuing to explore strategic alternatives for AGF, including a potential sale of a majority interest.    •Debt maturities for the Matched Investment Program (MIP) are expected to be funded through cash flows generated from invested assets, as well as the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program. However, mismatches in the timing of cash flows of the MIP, as well as any shortfalls due to impairments of MIP assets, would need to be funded by AIG Parent. In addition, as a result of AIG's restructuring activities, AIG expects to utilize assets from its noncore businesses and subsidiaries to provide future cash flow enhancement and help the MIP meet its maturing debt obligations.   •Approximately $813 million of AIGFP's debt maturities through March 31, 2011 are fully collateralized, with assets backing the corresponding liabilities; however, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and AIGFP's ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.   •AIG expects to meet its debt maturities primarily through borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. The Department of the Treasury Commitment is primarily used for capital support of subsidiaries. In the future, AIG may need to provide additional capital support for its subsidiaries. AIG has developed certain plans, some of which have already been implemented, to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility. In addition, certain of AIG's outstanding financial derivative transactions could require collateral calls or termination payments based on a downgrade in AIG's credit rating. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Sales of Other Businesses   Since September 2008 and through April 28, 2010, AIG entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets, excluding AIA, ALICO and assets held by AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP), that had aggregate assets and liabilities with carrying values of $95.5 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2010 or the date of sale. Of these amounts, pending transactions with aggregate assets and liabilities of $54.7 billion and $49.2, respectively, at March 31, 2010 are expected to generate approximately $709 million of aggregate net cash proceeds that will be available to reduce the amount of the FRBNY Credit Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses, settlement of intercompany loan facilities, and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes. Gains and losses recorded in connection with the dispositions of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment. Based on the transactions closed to date, AIG does not believe that such adjustments will be material to future consolidated results of operations or cash flows.   See Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  96      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries    AIG Parent  The following table presents AIG Parent's sources of liquidity:                            As of      (In millions)   March 31, 2010   April 28, 2010            Available borrowing under the FRBNY Credit Facility    $ 12,507    $ 11,007      Cash and short-term investments      372      375      Available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment      22,292      22,292            Total    $ 35,171    $ 33,674              AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, catastrophic losses or reserve strengthening, or a further deterioration in the super senior credit default swap portfolio may result in significant additional cash needs, or loss of some sources of liquidity, or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   Historically, AIG has depended on dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. In light of AIG's current financial situation, certain of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG. As a result, AIG has also been dependent on the FRBNY as a primary source of liquidity, and on the Department of the Treasury Commitment to support the capital needs of AIG's insurance company subsidiaries. In the first three months of 2010, AIG Parent collected $323 million in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries (primarily from insurance company subsidiaries), which included $250 million in dividends from Chartis U.S.   AIG's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding. In the first three months of 2010, AIG Parent retired $850 million of debt and made interest payments totaling $345 million, excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. AIG Parent made $2.2 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the three months ended March 31, 2010, of which the majority was contributed to AIG Capital Corporation, enabling AIG Capital Corporation to redeem its preferred securities held by a Chartis U.S. subsidiary. In addition, in March 2010, AIG Parent repurchased AIG common stock from an insurance subsidiary and repaid $1.6 billion in loans to AGF.   At the current time, AIG Parent has no access to the commercial paper market, one of its traditional sources for its short-term working capital needs. While no assurance can be given that AIG will be able to access its traditional sources of long-term or short-term financing through the public debt markets again, AIG periodically evaluates its ability to access the capital markets.   General Insurance   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. One or more large catastrophes, however, may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected General Insurance operations. In addition, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries. A downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of General Insurance subsidiaries as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital.   Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's General Insurance investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. AIG's asset/liability  97      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of AIG's General Insurance investments and the payment of claims. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments for further information.   Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations   The most significant potential liquidity needs of AIG's Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies are the funding of surrenders and withdrawals. A substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies. However, management considers the sources of liquidity for Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed income securities, in order to reduce the high levels of liquidity which had been maintained during 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from their projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. A significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, which could be triggered by a variety of factors, including AIG specific concerns, could result in a substantial liquidity strain. Other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other economic or political upheaval.   AIG believes that its Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies currently have adequate capital to support their business plans. However, to the extent that these subsidiaries experience significant future losses or declines in their investment portfolios, AIG may need to contribute capital to these companies.   Financial Services   AIG's major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of ILFC, AIGFP, AGF and AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc (AIGCFG). Traditional sources of funds to meet the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available. These sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), issuance of long- and short-term debt, issuance of commercial paper, bank loans and bank credit facilities. However, during the three months ended March 31, 2010 and through April 30, 2010, ILFC and AGF made significant progress in addressing their foreseeable liquidity needs, as further described below. In addition, AIGCFG has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits, providing a measure of liquidity.   ILFC   During the first three months of 2010, ILFC refinanced five aircraft under its ECA Facility, borrowed $1.3 billion through secured financing arrangements and issued $2.0 billion senior notes as part of a private placement. Subsequent to March 31, 2010, ILFC issued an additional $750 million of senior notes under the same indenture as that used in the private placement.   At March 31, 2010, ILFC had reached the maximum amount available for secured financing under its revolving credit facilities and term loans. The capacity was approximately $5.3 billion. In addition, ILFC also reached the maximum amount of secured financing available for ILFC and its restricted subsidiaries under its bond indentures. Subsequent to March 31, 2010, ILFC amended its bank facilities and term loans to increase its capacity to enter into secured financings to 35 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets as defined in its revolving credit facilities, which assets approximated $15.0 billion at March 31, 2010 (subject to certain prepayment requirements), and extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. This agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones.   In addition, in April 2010, ILFC signed an agreement to sell 53 aircraft, with an aggregate book value of approximately $2.3 billion, which is expected to generate approximately $2.0 billion in gross proceeds during 2010.  98      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  The sales of the individual aircraft are expected to be consummated during the remainder of 2010 and the related proceeds are receivable upon the completion of each individual sale. ILFC is currently pursuing additional potential aircraft sales. Proposed portfolios have been presented to potential buyers; some bids have been received and are being evaluated. In evaluating these bids, ILFC management is balancing the need for funds with the long-term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives. Significant uncertainties currently exist about the possibility of additional sales, including the aircraft comprising an actual sale portfolio, the sale price and whether a sale agreement could be reached on acceptable terms.   Because the current market for aircraft is depressed due to the economic downturn and limited availability of buyer financing, it is likely that if additional aircraft are sold to meet liquidity needs, realized losses may be incurred. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment charges aggregating $347 million and operating lease related losses of $84 million on aircraft under contract to be sold.   AIG expects that ILFC's existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, including potential debt issuances and aircraft sales will be sufficient for ILFC to meet its existing obligations for at least the next twelve months.       ILFC Notes and Bonds Payable   As of March 31, 2010 notes and bonds aggregating $18.2 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2016. To the extent considered appropriate, ILFC may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds.   On October 13, 2009, ILFC entered into two term loan agreements (the Term Loans) with AIG Funding comprised of a new $2.0 billion credit agreement and a $1.7 billion amended and restated credit agreement. The Term Loans are secured by a portfolio of aircraft and all related equipment and leases. ILFC used the proceeds from the $2.0 billion loan to repay in full its obligations under its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility that matured on October 15, 2009. The second credit agreement amended and restated the two demand note agreements aggregating $1.7 billion that ILFC entered into in March 2009 with AIG Funding, including extending the maturity date of such demand notes. Both Term Loans mature on September 13, 2013 and currently bear interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 6.025 percent, of which 3.0 percent is permitted to be paid-in-kind and is added to the principal balance of the loans. The Term Loans are due in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization. On December 4, 2009, the new $2.0 billion credit agreement was increased to $2.2 billion. The funds for the Term Loans were provided to AIG Funding through the FRBNY Credit Facility. As a condition of the FRBNY approving the Term Loans, ILFC entered into agreements to guarantee the repayment of AIG's obligations under the FRBNY Credit Agreement up to an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding balance of the Term Loans.       ILFC ECA Facilities   ILFC has a $4.3 billion 1999 ECA Facility that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.81 percent to 5.86 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At March 31, 2010, ILFC had 27 loans with a remaining principal balance of $120 million outstanding under this facility. At March 31, 2010, the net book value of the related aircraft was $1.7 billion. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of an ILFC subsidiary, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility.   ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 ECA Facility, which was amended in May 2009 to allow ILFC to borrow up to a maximum of $4.6 billion to fund the purchase of Airbus aircraft delivered through June 30, 2010. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a forward-looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 2.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 4.20 percent to 4.71 percent. At March 31, 2010, ILFC had financed 71 aircraft using approximately $4.1 billion under this facility and approximately $2.9 billion was outstanding. At March 31, 2010, the interest rate of the loans  99      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  outstanding ranged from 0.35 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. At March 31, 2010, the net book value of the related aircraft was approximately $4.2 billion. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC's notes and bonds payable in the table below.   Under its current long-term debt ratings, ILFC needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 ECA Facility before it can fund Airbus aircraft deliveries under the facility. As of April 30, 2010, ILFC had approximately $500 million available under the 2004 ECA Facility to finance its Airbus aircraft purchases through June 2010. ILFC refinanced five aircraft under the 2004 ECA Facility during the first three months of 2010. ILFC's current credit ratings also require (i) the segregation of security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments received for aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts, controlled by the trustees of the 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities; and (ii) the filings of individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which the aircraft is registered. At March 31, 2010, ILFC had segregated security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments aggregating $350 million related to such aircraft. Segregated rental payments are used to pay principal and interest on the ECA facilities as they become due.   During the three months ended March 31, 2010, ILFC entered into agreements to cross-collateralize the two ECA Facilities. In conjunction with the agreement, ILFC agreed to an acceleration event, which would accelerate all debt related to aircraft funded during 2010 if, among other things, ILFC were to sell aircraft with an aggregate book value exceeding an agreed upon amount, currently approximately $10.8 billion, within a period starting from the date of the agreement until December 31, 2012.       ILFC Bank Financings   At March 31, 2010, the total funded amount of ILFC's bank financings was $5.0 billion, which includes $4.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. The fundings mature through February 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.40 percent. At March 31, 2010, the interest rates ranged from 0.56 percent to 0.90 percent. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.   Subsequent to March 31, 2010, ILFC amended covenants under its revolving credit facilities and term loans to increase its capacity to enter into secured financings from 12.5 percent to 35 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets, as defined in its credit facility agreement, which assets approximated $15.0 billion at March 31, 2010 (subject to certain prepayment requirements). In conjunction with the amendment, ILFC (i) extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012 (subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones), with the loan secured by aircraft with an initial loan-to-value ratio of 75 percent, and increased the interest rate by 1.5 percent; (ii) pre-paid $410 million of bank term debt with original maturity dates through 2012; and, (iii) increased the interest rate by 1.5 percent on $75 million principal amount of bank term debt.   AIGFP   Prior to September 2008, AIGFP had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds, GIA borrowings, other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements.   On April 26, 2010, an aggregate of $2.3 billion of commercial paper of Curzon Funding LLC and Nightingale Finance LLC outstanding under the CPFF was repaid through an increase in borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility. AIGFP continues to rely on AIG Parent to meet most of its liquidity needs.  100      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP:                                  Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2009   Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty   Collateral Returned by Counterparties   Collateral Posted as of March 31, 2010     Three Months Ended March 31, 2010     (in millions)            Collateralized GIAs and other borrowings   $ 6,129   $ 112   $ 217   $ 6,024      Super senior CDS portfolio     4,590     60     198     4,452      All other derivatives     5,217     450     1,414     4,253            Total   $ 15,936   $ 622   $ 1,829   $ 14,729                  AIGFP Wind-down   AIGFP has continued unwinding its businesses and portfolios. During 2010, AIGFP reduced the notional amount of its derivative portfolio by 20 percent, from $940.7 billion at December 31, 2009 to $755.4 billion at March 31, 2010. AIGFP reduced the number of its outstanding trade positions by approximately 1,800, from approximately 16,100 at December 31, 2009 to approximately 14,300 at March 31, 2010. In connection with these activities, AIGFP has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate "books" and has developed a plan for addressing each book, including assessing each book's risks, risk mitigation options, monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes. Each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of AIG. The plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve, and they contemplate, depending on the book in question, alternative strategies, including sales, assignments or other transfers of positions, terminations of positions, and/or run-offs of positions in accordance with existing terms. Execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving senior members of AIGFP's and AIG's respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences. Successful execution of these plans is subject, to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book, to market conditions and, in many circumstances, counterparty negotiation and agreement.   In connection with the wind-down, certain assets were sold. The proceeds from these sales have been used to fund AIGFP's wind-down and are not included in the amounts described above under AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due. The FRBNY waived the requirement under the FRBNY Credit Agreement that the proceeds of these specific sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the FRBNY Credit Facility, which would have resulted in a permanent reduction of the FRBNY's commitment to lend to AIG. Instead, the FRBNY has given AIGFP permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales, and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the FRBNY Credit Facility, with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the FRBNY Credit Facility. AIGFP is also opportunistically terminating contracts. As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses. AIGFP has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio, including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in connection with Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III), a sale of its commodity index business, termination and sale of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker, and sale and other disposition of its energy/infrastructure investment portfolio. Due to the long-term duration of AIGFP's derivative contracts and the complexity of AIGFP's portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades. In addition, the Determination Memoranda issued by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation place significant new restrictions on the compensation of AIGFP employees included in the five executives named in AIG's Proxy Statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of AIG (Top 25) and AIG's next 75 most highly compensated employees and executive officers  101      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  (together, the Top 100) and may impair AIGFP's ability to retain these employees, and consequently negatively impact the wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios.   AGF   Prior to September 2008, AGF's traditional source of liquidity had been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets.   AGF anticipates that its primary sources of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections, additional on-balance sheet securitizations, portfolio sales and other borrowings. In order to improve cash flow from operations, AGF has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses. Since year end 2009, AGF has continued to manage its liquidity with proceeds of more than $500 million from a real estate loan securitization in March 2010 and the execution and full drawdown of a $3.0 billion five-year secured term loan in April 2010. In addition, AIG is exploring other strategic alternatives for AGF, including a potential sale of a majority interest. AIG made an $11 million capital contribution to AGF (through AIG Capital Corporation) during the first three months of 2010. In March 2010, AGF repaid the $2.45 billion one-year term loans and in April 2010, AGF repaid the $2.125 billion revolving credit facility, both prior to their due dates in July 2010. AIG manages its liquidity on a consolidated basis, which may include making or receiving short-term loans with AGF.       AGF Notes and Bonds Payable   As of March 31, 2010, notes and bonds payable aggregating $16.9 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from 0.51 percent to 9.00 percent. To the extent considered appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF.   AIGCFG   AIG believes that the funding needs of AIGCFG have stabilized, as AIGCFG has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits, but it is possible that renewed customer and counterparty concerns could increase AIGCFG's liquidity needs in 2010.  102                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Debt   The following table provides the rollforward of AIG's total debt outstanding:                                           Three Months Ended March 31, 2010 (in millions)   Balance at December 31, 2009   Issuances   Maturities and Repayments   Effect of Foreign Exchange   Other Non-Cash Changes(a)   Activity of Discontinued Operations   Reclassified to Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale   Balance at March 31, 2010            Debt issued by AIG:                                                        FRBNY Credit Facility    $ 23,435   $ 8,300   $ (4,551 ) $ -   $ 216   $ -   $ -    $ 27,400        Notes and bonds payable      10,419     -     (850 )   (109 )   (3 )   -     -      9,457        Junior subordinated debt      12,001     -     -     (302 )   -     -     -      11,699        Junior subordinated debt attributable to equity units      5,880     -     -     -     -     -     -      5,880        Loans and mortgages payable      438     -     -     (11 )   -     -     -      427        MIP matched notes and bonds payable      13,371     -     (500 )   (152 )   (77 )   -     -      12,642        Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable      3,913     -     (48 )   -     3     -     -      3,868              Total AIG debt      69,457     8,300     (5,949 )   (574 )   139     -     -      71,373            Debt guaranteed by AIG:                                                      AIGFP, at fair value(b):                                                        FRBNY commercial paper funding facility      2,742     2,272     (3,837 )   -     1,108     -     -      2,285        GIAs      8,257     100     (295 )   -     291     -     -      8,353        Notes and bonds payable      2,029     12     (162 )   -     37     -     -      1,916        Loans and mortgages payable      1,022     18     (162 )   -     (53 )   -     -      825        Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      1,887     -     (34 )   -     (147 )   -     -      1,706              Total AIGFP debt      15,937     2,402     (4,490 )   -     1,236     -     -      15,085            AIG Funding – FRBNY                                                        commercial paper funding facility      1,997     -     (2,000 )   -     3     -     -      -            AIGLH notes and bonds payable      798     -     -     -     -     -     -      798            Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock      1,339     -     -     -     -     -     -      1,339            Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG      89,528     10,702     (12,439 )   (574 )   1,378     -     -      88,595            Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                                      ILFC:                                                        Notes and bonds payable, ECA facilities, bank financings and other secured financings(c)      25,174     3,407     (740 )   (131 )   1     -     -      27,711        Junior subordinated debt      999     -     -     -     -     -     -      999              Total ILFC debt      26,173     3,407     (740 )   (131 )   1     -     -      28,710            AGF:                                                        Notes and bonds payable(d)      19,770     501     (3,292 )   (61 )   16     -     -      16,934        Junior subordinated debt      349     -     -     -     -     -     -      349              Total AGF debt      20,119     501     (3,292 )   (61 )   16     -     -      17,283            AIGCFG loans and mortgages payable      216     62     (62 )   (8 )   (140 )   -     -      68            Other subsidiaries      295     14     (4 )   (4 )   164     -     (7 )    458            Total debt of consolidated investments(e)      5,141     55     (1,063 )   (14 )   834     (63 )   (575 )    4,315            Total debt not guaranteed by AIG      51,944     4,039     (5,161 )   (218 )   875     (63 )   (582 )    50,834            Total debt:                                                      Total long-term debt      136,733     12,469     (11,763 )   (792 )   1,142     (63 )   (582 )    137,144      FRBNY commercial paper funding facility      4,739     2,272     (5,837 )   -     1,111     -     -      2,285            Total debt    $ 141,472   $ 14,741   $ (17,600 ) $ (792 ) $ 2,253   $ (63 ) $ (582 )  $ 139,429               (a)FRBNY Credit Facility reflects $216 million of accrued compounding interest and fees.

Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of April 30, 2010. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the  104      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of AIGFP's GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require AIGFP, upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings, to post collateral or, with the consent of the counterparties, assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effect of a downgrade in AIG's credit ratings on AIGFP's financial derivative transactions, see Item 1A.

For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of AIG's control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on inforce policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (d)Represents guaranteed maturities under GICs. (e)Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (f)Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.6 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. (g)The majority of AIGFP's credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At March 31, 2010, the fair value derivative liability was $4.3 billion relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, net of amounts realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, AIGFP has posted collateral of $3.7 billion with respect to these swaps (prior to offsets for other transactions).   The repayment of long-term debt maturities, net borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and interest payments on borrowings by AIG and its subsidiaries are expected to be made through the disposition of assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements, as more fully described in AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due above.   Loss reserves relate primarily to General Insurance business. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by the individual General Insurance subsidiaries to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. These subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments and investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein). Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, management believes there are generally sufficient resources within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual needs.  106      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Insurance and investment contract liabilities, and GIC liabilities, relate primarily to Life Insurance and Retirement Services business. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by individual Life Insurance and Retirement Services subsidiaries to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. These subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments and investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein). Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, management believes there are generally sufficient resources within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual needs.   At March 31, 2010, ILFC has committed to purchase 120 new aircraft deliverable from 2010 through 2019, at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $13.7 billion. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   The following table summarizes Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                     At March 31, 2010       Amount of Commitment Expiration      (in millions)   Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2010   2011 - 2012   2013 - 2014   2015   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 856   $ -   $ 755   $ -   $ -   $ 101        Standby letters of credit     1,263     1,094     28     18     -     123        Construction guarantees(b)     92     2     21     -     -     69        Guarantees of indebtedness     213     -     -     -     -     213        All other guarantees(c)     813     32     178     159     243     201      Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(d)     6,239     1,710     2,056     1,398     241     834        Commitments to extend credit     179     50     97     28     2     2        Letters of credit     245     161     84     -     -     -        Other commercial commitments(e)     767     10     -     -     -     757            Total(f)   $ 10,667   $ 3,059   $ 3,219   $ 1,603   $ 486   $ 2,300               (a)Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (b)Primarily SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. (c)Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnifications included in asset sales agreements. (d)Includes commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in limited partnerships and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate businesses. (e)Includes options to acquire aircraft. Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2010 is expected to be approximately $97 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (f)Does not include guarantees or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.   The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.   See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion on restrictions on payments of dividends.  107                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities    While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Results of Operations    AIG reports the results of its operations through four reportable segments: General Insurance, Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, and Financial Services. Through these reportable segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG's Other operations category consists of business and items not allocated to AIG's reportable segments. AIG's subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG's Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad.   The following discussion of consolidated and segment results represent comparisons of the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 compared to the three-month period March 31, 2009.       Consolidated Results  The following table presents AIG's condensed consolidated results of operations:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Revenues:                          Premiums and other considerations    $ 10,067    $ 12,841      (22 )%      Net investment income      4,836      915      429        Net realized capital losses      (548 )    (2,774 )    -        Unrealized market valuation gains (losses) on AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio      119      (452 )    -        Other income      1,856      2,785      (33 )            Total revenues      16,330      13,315      23            Benefits, claims and expenses:                          Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      8,519      11,353      (25 )      Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses      3,262      3,576      (9 )      Interest expense      1,734      2,587      (33 )      Restructuring expenses and related asset impairment and other expenses      110      338      (67 )      Net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses      77      (262 )    -        Other expenses      1,793      2,239      (20 )            Total benefits, claims and expenses      15,495      19,831      (22 )          Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax benefit      835      (6,516 )    -      Income tax benefit      (91 )    (1,303 )    -            Income (loss) from continuing operations      926      (5,213 )    -      Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense (benefit)      1,173      80      -            Net income (loss)      2,099      (5,133 )    -            Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests      648      (780 )    -            Net income (loss) attributable to AIG    $ 1,451    $ (4,353 )    - %           108      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries         Premiums and Other Considerations    Premiums and other considerations decreased due to:    •a reduction of $1.9 billion in 2010 from dispositions during 2009, including the sales of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) and 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic; and   •a decline in Commercial Insurance net premiums earned due to the continued unfavorable pricing environment and weak economy. The decline also reflects price discipline in workers' compensation and capital management initiatives.        Net Investment Income   The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Fixed maturities, including short-term investments    $ 3,186    $ 3,630      (12 )%    Maiden Lane interests      911      (2,194 )    -      Equity securities      40      68      (41 )    Interest on mortgage and other loans      104      124      (16 )    Partnerships      388      (787 )    -      Mutual funds      16      (27 )    -      Real estate      222      226      (2 )    Other investments      7      87      (92 )          Total investment income before policyholder income and trading gains (losses)      4,874      1,127      332      Policyholder investment income and trading losses      5      (35 )    -            Total investment income      4,879      1,092      347      Investment expenses      43      177      (76 )          Net investment income    $ 4,836    $ 915      429 %            Net investment income increased primarily due to:    •a gain of $751 million in 2010 associated with the change in fair value of AIG's interest in ML III and a gain of $160 million in 2010 associated with the change in fair value of ML II compared to losses of $2.2 billion in 2009. This improvement was due to favorable valuation changes, primarily resulting from:     •the shortening of the weighted average lives;   •the narrowing of credit spreads; and   •the improvement in credit quality of the underlying collateral securities.    •increased income from partnership investments in 2010 compared to losses in 2009, reflecting stronger market conditions in 2010.    These increases were partially offset by:    •lower levels of invested assets, including the effect of divested businesses; and   •lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments that were held for liquidity purposes.   109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009            Sales of fixed maturity securities    $ 295    $ -      Sales of equity securities      110      (57 )    Sales of real estate and loans      (9 )    (29 )    Other-than-temporary impairments:                    Severity      (51 )    (1,610 )      Change in intent      (28 )    (700 )      Foreign currency declines      (32 )    (78 )      Issuer-specific credit events      (963 )    (1,120 )      Adverse projected cash flows on structured securities      -      (141 )    Provision for loan losses      (123 )    -      Foreign exchange transactions      645      272      Derivative instruments      (460 )    964      Other      68      (275 )          Total    $ (548 )  $ (2,774 )            Net realized capital losses decreased primarily due to the following:    •lower other-than-temporary impairment charges for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 included non-credit impairments (i.e. severity losses) that are no longer required for fixed maturity securities due to the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard commencing in the second quarter of 2009. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Investments — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments;   •gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities in the current year reflecting improvement in the credit markets; and   •increased foreign exchange transaction gains.    Partially offsetting the above items were losses on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment compared to gains in the year-ago period due primarily to the tightening of credit spreads.       Unrealized Market Valuation Gains (Losses) on AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio    AIG recognized unrealized market valuation gains related to AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 due to the improvement in market conditions as well as the narrowing of corporate credit spreads.   See Segment Results — Financial Services Operations — Financial Services Results — Capital Markets Results and Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Other Income    Other income decreased due to:    •a decline of $1.6 billion in net credit valuation adjustment gains on AIGFP's assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value, excluding gains and losses which are reflected in Unrealized gains (losses) on AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio, partially offset by reduced losses from Capital Markets from lower unwind costs and lower unrealized market valuation losses; and   110      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   •lower aircraft leasing revenues resulting from ILFC aircraft asset impairment charges of $347 million with respect to aircraft which will be sold subsequent to March 31, 2010, and operating lease related charges totaling $84 million related to those aircraft for the three-month period ended March 31, 2010.        Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred    Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased due to:    •a reduction of $1.3 billion as a result of dispositions in 2009, including the sales of HSB and 21st Century, and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic;   •lower production levels for General Insurance and Domestic Life & Retirement Services; and   •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expense for Mortgage Guaranty operations of $794 million primarily due to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies and higher cure rates on existing first-lien delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies.    Partially offsetting the items above were catastrophe losses for General Insurance in 2010 totaling $481 million primarily related to the Chile earthquake, U.S. wind storms and Madeira (Portugal) floods.       Policy Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses    Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased primarily due a reduction of $580 million as a result of dispositions during 2009, including the sales of HSB, 21st Century and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic, partially offset by the effects of $222 million of amortization of a premium deficiency reserve by UGC in 2009.       Interest Expense    Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility benefited from a reduced interest rate of 3.25 percent in 2010 compared to 6.5 percent in 2009 as well as a lower outstanding balance of $27.4 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $47.4 billion at March 31, 2009. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $650 million in 2010 compared to $1.3 billion in 2009. Interest expense in 2010 included $521 million of amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset associated with the FRBNY Credit Facility compared to $705 million in 2009.       Restructuring Expenses and Related Asset Impairment and Other Expenses    Restructuring expenses decreased in 2010 reflecting progress made under the restructuring plan and asset disposition initiatives. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses.       Net (gain) loss on Sale of Divested Businesses    Net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses includes the net gain (loss) on the sale of divested businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations. In 2009, included a gain of $251 million from the sale of HSB. See Segment Results — Other Operations — Other Results herein for further information.       Other Expenses    Other expenses decreased primarily due to lower compensation-related costs for the noncore Asset Management businesses reflecting the effect of the deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments, as well as a decline in Consumer Finance provision for loan losses of $226 million.       Income Tax Benefits    For the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on the pre-tax income from continuing operations was (10.9) percent and the effective tax rate on the pre-tax income included in discontinued operations  111      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  was (13.2) percent. The effective tax rate was negative because AIG recorded a tax benefit on pre-tax income. The tax benefit was primarily due to decreases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $82 million related to certain subsidiaries that file separate income tax returns, $140 million which principally offsets the tax expense related to the pre-tax income from continuing operations earned during the quarter, and $665 million related to changes in value of subsidiaries to be sold and included in discontinued operations.   The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 was 20.0 percent. The effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate due primarily to a $1.6 billion increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance against a portion of AIG's net deferred tax asset, partially offset by $632 million of deferred tax benefits mainly attributable to the book to tax basis differences of AIG Parent's investment in subsidiaries and other discrete period items.   At March 31, 2010 AIG's net deferred tax asset was comprised of $8.3 billion of net deferred tax asset related to its U.S. consolidated income tax group (net of $19.6 billion valuation allowance) and $0.1 billion of net deferred tax liability related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. AIG assesses its ability to realize the deferred tax asset based on AIG's ability to generate sufficient earnings from transactions expected to be completed in the near future and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset. This assessment does not depend on projected future operating income.   In any interim period, the U.S. consolidated income tax group may generate income or loss. To the extent that any operating income is generated, the related tax expense may be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. Conversely, any tax benefits arising from operating losses may be offset by an additional valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Any reduction of the valuation allowance will be allocated to continuing operations, discontinued operations and components of shareholder's equity based on the intraperiod tax allocation rules. AIG's foreign subsidiaries and U.S. subsidiaries filing separate returns will continue to recognize tax expense and tax benefits, based on their income or loss, which will be reflected in AIG's consolidated provision.   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Discontinued Operations   Total revenues and pre-tax income (loss) for entities reported as discontinued operations were as follows:                                                    Pre-tax Income (Loss)              Total Revenues    Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)       2010   2009   2010   2009            AIA    $ 3,175    $ 2,787      14 %  $ 658    $ 390      69 %    ALICO      3,522      2,461      43      543      175      210      Nan Shan      2,143      1,638      31      18      (158 )    -      Interest allocation*      -      -      -      (183 )    (258 )    -            Total    $ 8,840    $ 6,886      28 %  $ 1,036    $ 149      - %            * Represents interest expense, including periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset, on debt to be assumed by the buyers of AIA and ALICO and on the estimated portion of the FRBNY Credit Facility required to be repaid as a result of the disposition transactions.      American International Assurance Company, Ltd.    AIA total revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased over the same period last year reflecting increased business growth, higher net investment income, realized capital gains and the positive effect of foreign exchange. Premiums and other considerations increased 7 percent to $2.4 billion from continued strength in new and renewal business. Net investment income increased 27 percent to $0.7 billion as higher investment yields and  112      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  growth in assets under management offset higher net investment losses related to policyholder investment income and trading gains (losses) which are offset in policyholder benefits and claims incurred. In the first quarter of 2010 AIA reported net realized capital gains of $107 million compared to $25 million in the same period last year. The improvement in net realized capital gains was due to lower impairment charges and equity gains realized in 2010.   Pre-tax income increased significantly over last year largely due to growth in business, higher realized capital gains, higher investment returns, and the positive effect of foreign exchange.       American Life Insurance Company    ALICO total revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased over the same period last year reflecting increased business growth, higher net investment income and lower net realized capital losses. Premiums and other considerations increased 7 percent to $2.5 billion from continued strength in new and renewal business. Net investment income more than doubled from last year to $1.1 billion due to net investment income related to policyholder investment income and trading gains (losses) of $292 million in 2010 compared to a net investment loss related to policyholder investment income and trading gains (losses) of $239 million in 2009, as well as fair value gains on trading account assets in the U.K. Net investment income related to policyholder investment income and trading gains (losses) is offset in policyholder benefits and claims incurred. Realized capital losses declined in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges.   Pre-tax income increased significantly over last year largely due to lower realized capital losses and higher investment returns from trading gains in 2010 compared to trading losses in 2009. In addition, 2009 included a DAC benefit related to net realized capital losses of $232 million which more than offset the negative effect of market volatility on Japan annuity and investment-linked products.       Nan Shan Life Insurance Company    Nan Shan total revenues increased over the same period last year primarily due to net realized capital gains of $74 million in 2010 compared to net realized capital losses of $243 million in 2009, growth in business and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. Net realized capital gains in 2010 were driven mainly by realized capital gains on equity securities which more than offset impairment and derivative losses. The net realized capital losses in 2009 were comprised primarily of losses on derivatives hedging currency risk and other-than-temporary impairment charges.   Nan Shan reported pre-tax income in 2010 compared to a loss in 2009 primarily due to the realized capital gains which offset the effect of increased negative interest rate spreads.   Net income from discontinued operations also reflects a partial release of a valuation allowance attributable to an increase in estimated value to be realized on the expected sales of AIA and ALICO, which are classified as discontinued operations.

Segment Results   AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. In managing its businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business based on pre-tax income (loss), excluding net realized capital gains (losses), results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses, because AIG believes that this permits better assessment and enhances understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.  113                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment.

As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG uses underwriting profit (loss) to assess performance of the General Insurance business rather than statutory underwriting profit (loss).   Commercial Insurance writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Commercial Insurance the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Commercial Insurance without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit Commercial Insurance to accept a risk.   AIG's Foreign General insurance group writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of branches and foreign based insurance subsidiaries. Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. Foreign General insurance group operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, the U.K., Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.  114      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      General Insurance Results   The following table presents General Insurance results:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Underwriting results:                          Net premiums written    $ 7,644    $ 7,727      (1) %      Decrease (increase) in unearned premiums      (3 )    545      -              Net premiums earned      7,641      8,272      (8 )      Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred      5,459      5,787      (6 )      Change in deferred acquisition costs      (18 )    5      -        Other underwriting expenses      2,392      2,205      8              Underwriting profit (loss)      (192 )    275      -            Net investment income      1,071      435      146      Net realized capital gains (losses)      137      (608 )    -            Pre-tax income    $ 1,016    $ 102      - %            General Insurance Underwriting Results   In managing its general insurance businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of its businesses using underwriting profit. Underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses, including the change in deferred acquisition costs.   AIG, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the cost of claims and expenses, respectively. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.   Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period.   The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio.   General Insurance Net Premiums Written   General Insurance recorded $7.6 billion in net premiums written in the first quarter of 2010, a 1 percent decrease from the first quarter of 2009. The modest decline reflects General Insurance's price discipline where market rates are unsatisfactory, including workers' compensation, strategic growth in high margin lines of business, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. While the business continues to see increased business retention, new business submissions, and a continued stable rate environment, net premium writings continue to be affected by challenging economic conditions.  115      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on General Insurance net premiums written:                     Three Months Ended March 31,   2010 vs. 2009            Decrease in original currency*      (3.8 )%    Foreign exchange effect      2.7            Decrease as reported in U.S. dollars      (1.1 )%             *Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.   General Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table summarizes General Insurance GAAP combined ratios:                        Three Months Ended March 31,   2010   2009            Loss ratio      71.4      70.0      Expense ratio      31.1      26.7            Combined ratio      102.5      96.7              The increase in the General Insurance combined ratio primarily resulted from the following:   •a loss ratio for accident year 2010 recorded in 2010 which was 7.0 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2009. This increase is the product of higher catastrophe losses driven by a $310 million loss due to the earthquake in Chile, $119 million in losses due to two severe windstorms in the Northeastern United States and $52 million in losses due to flooding in Madeira (Portugal), in total accounting for a 6.0 point increase in the accident year loss ratio;   •an increase of 4.4 points in the expense ratio primarily due to a decline in earned premiums and higher expenses, driven by increased pension costs and higher transition and financial remediation costs; and   •the effects of premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends.   These increases were partially offset by favorable prior year development which amounted to $244 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to adverse development of $172 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The current period includes $204 million of favorable development in the Lexington businesses of Commercial Insurance, while the three months ended March 31, 2009 includes $169 million of adverse development related to the Excess Casualty business.   General Insurance Net Loss Development   General Insurance experienced $244 million of favorable development in the three months ended March 31, 2010. This is primarily attributable to strong favorable development in Commercial Insurance's Lexington lines of business, partially offset by adverse development in Risk Finance and Reinsurance. Foreign General Insurance also experienced favorable development, primarily in its directors & officers' liability (D&O) lines.   General Insurance Investing Results and Other Income   Net investment income for General Insurance increased primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments. Net realized capital gains were recognized in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments.   See Consolidated Results for further discussion on Net investment income and Net realized capital gains (losses).  116      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Commercial Insurance Results  The following table presents Commercial Insurance results:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Underwriting results:                          Net premiums written    $ 3,787    $ 4,184      (9 )%      Decrease in unearned premiums      775      1,043      (26 )            Net premiums earned      4,562      5,227      (13 )      Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred      3,474      4,094      (15 )      Change in deferred acquisition costs      129      130      (1 )      Other underwriting expenses      1,070      1,024      4              Underwriting loss      (111 )    (21 )    -            Net investment income      844      300      181      Net realized capital losses      (3 )    (503 )    -            Pre-tax income (loss)    $ 730    $ (224 )    - %            Commercial Insurance Underwriting Results      Commercial Insurance Net Premiums written  The following table presents Commercial Insurance net premiums written by line of business:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            General liability/auto liability    $ 582    $ 669      (13 )%    Workers' compensation      547      719     (24 )    Property      418      427     (2 )    A&H products      385      331     16      Management/professional liability      353      345     2      Commercial umbrella/excess      325      353     (8 )    Multinational P&C      236      268     (12 )    Private client group      227      210     8      Programs      158      168     (6 )    Healthcare      113      158     (28 )    Environmental      109      119     (8 )    Aviation      32      34     (6 )    Other      302      383     (21 )          Total    $ 3,787    $ 4,184      (9 )%            Commercial Insurance net premiums written decreased primarily due to:   •lower U.S. workers' compensation premiums due to declining rates, lower employment levels, increased competition and a strategy to remain price disciplined; and   •declines in the construction, real estate and transportation lines of business, which were more negatively affected by the credit crisis compared to other lines of businesses. In addition, limited capital for new projects reduced the demand for general liability and commercial umbrella insurance.  117      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Commercial Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents Commercial Insurance GAAP combined ratios:                        Three Months Ended March 31,   2010   2009            Loss ratio      76.2      78.3      Expense ratio      26.3      22.1            Combined ratio      102.5      100.4              The increase in the Commercial Insurance combined ratio primarily resulted from the following:   •an accident year loss ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2010 that was 5.5 points higher than the accident year loss ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2009, resulting from an increase in catastrophe-related losses of $177 million attributable to the combined losses of two severe windstorms in the Northeastern US and the earthquake in Chile;   •an increase in the expense ratio of 4.2 points due to a decline in earned premiums and higher expenses driven by increased pension costs and transition and financial remediation costs; and   •the effects of premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends.   These increases were partially offset by a change in prior-year development. For the three month period ended March 31, 2010 Commercial Insurance recorded favorable development of $190 million compared to adverse development of $164 million in the same period of 2009. The net favorable development for 2010 includes $59 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies compared to $100 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies in the same period in 2009.   Commercial Insurance Net Loss Development   The $190 million of favorable development in the three months ended March 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to favorable development in the Lexington lines of business, with property contributing $127 million and catastrophe excess liability contributing $40 million. Lexington's development was partially offset by $35 million of adverse development in Risk Finance and $21 million of adverse development in Reinsurance. Excess casualty and excess workers' compensation, while not contributing to the favorable development in 2010, did not experience any further adverse development.   Commercial Insurance Investing Results   Net investment income for Commercial Insurance increased primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments of $463 million.   Net realized capital losses for Commercial Insurance declined due to lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments.

Catastrophe losses included $252 million due to the earthquake in Chile and $52 million due to the flooding in Madeira (Portugal); and   •an increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to higher general operating expenses and acquisition costs.   Foreign General Insurance Net Loss Development   Foreign General Insurance experienced $54 million of favorable development in the three months ended March 31, 2010, including $28 million of favorable development from the D&O line of business. The remainder was spread throughout the other lines of business.   Foreign General Insurance Investing Results and Other Income   Foreign General Insurance Net investment income increased primarily due to higher partnership and mutual fund results partially offset by lower interest and dividend income.   Foreign General Insurance recorded Net realized capital gains in 2010 due to gains in the sales of fixed maturity securities, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments.   On March 31, 2010, a subsidiary of Chartis International purchased additional voting shares in Fuji. Investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 includes an equity pick-up of $56 million pertaining to the minority ownership as well as a gain of $47 million reflecting remeasurement of the equity interest in Fuji held prior to the acquisition of the additional shares, offset by a $72 million charge resulting from the reversal through income of Chartis' share of Fuji's other comprehensive income.

(b)Includes $1.5 billion related to the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.   AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves (IBNR) and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  The following table classifies the components of the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense by business unit:                         (in millions)   March 31, 2010   December 31, 2009            General Insurance segment:                    Commercial Insurance    $ 50,089    $ 50,498        Foreign General Insurance      13,956      12,688            Total General Insurance      64,045      63,186              Mortgage Guaranty      4,504      4,713            Total net loss reserves    $ 68,549    $ 67,899             121                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Discounting of Reserves   At March 31, 2010, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.66 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. The discount is comprised of the following: $669 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance and $1.99 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance.   Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that the net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of March 31, 2010. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of March 31, 2010. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves:                         Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 67,899    $ 72,455      Foreign exchange effect      (553 )    (290 )    Acquisitions(a)      1,538      -      Dispositions      (25 )    (287 )(b)          Losses and loss expenses incurred:(c)                    Current year      5,998      7,862        Prior years, other than accretion of discount      (476 )    64        Prior years, accretion of discount      86      98            Losses and loss expenses incurred      5,608      8,024            Losses and loss expenses paid(c)      5,916      7,648            Reclassified to liabilities of businesses held for sale      (2 )    -            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 68,549    $ 72,254               (a)Represents the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for three-month period ended March 31, 2010. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   See General Insurance Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  As described more fully in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating  124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The March 31, 2010 gross asbestos survival ratio is lower than the ratio at March 31, 2009 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at March 31, 2010 by approximately 0.5 years and 1.4 years, respectively; and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at March 31, 2009 by approximately 1.1 years and 2.3 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.  The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                   2010    2009      Three Months Ended March 31,   Gross   Net   Gross   Net            Survival ratios:                                Asbestos      4.5      3.9      5.0      3.9        Environmental      4.4      3.3      4.4      3.2        Combined      4.5      3.8      4.9      3.8                  Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations    AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment, operating as SunAmerica Financial Group, is comprised of several life insurance and retirement services businesses that offer a comprehensive suite of life insurance, retirement savings products and guaranteed income solutions through an established multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, career financial advisors, wholesale life brokers, insurance agents and a direct-to-consumer platform.   AIG's Domestic Life Insurance businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance, and group life and health products. In addition, Domestic Life Insurance offers a variety of payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Domestic Retirement Services businesses offer group retirement products, individual fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds and financial planning and investment advisory services. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and fixed and variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. Domestic Retirement Services also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were written in (or issued to) the institutional market place prior to 2006.   In managing its Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses). Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) enhances the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of the Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the tables that follow.  125                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   The following table presents Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services results:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)              Premiums and other considerations    $ 1,315    $ 1,440      (9 )%      Net investment income      2,707      1,930      40        Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      2,201      2,590      (15 )      Policy acquisition and other expenses      698      940      (26 )          Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital losses      1,123      (160 )    -      Net realized capital losses      (796 )    (1,667 )    -            Pre-tax income (loss)    $ 327    $ (1,827 )    - %            Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reported higher pre-tax income before net realized capital losses primarily due to the following:   •an increase in net investment income as a result of growth in partnership returns, which amounted to $235 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2010 compared to losses of $373 million in the same period of 2009, as well as higher income from valuation adjustments from the interest in ML II, which offset the negative effects of higher liquidity in the investment portfolios; and   •lower DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening of $558 million. There were no unlockings in the three months ended March 31, 2010. Unlockings in the three months ended March 31, 2009 primarily were the result of reductions in the long-term growth assumptions for group retirement products and individual variable annuities and deteriorating equity market conditions early in 2009.   These improvements were partially offset by lower DAC and sale inducement assets (SIA) benefits related to net realized capital losses of $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $349 million in the three months ended March 31, 2009.   Pre-tax income for Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reflected a decline in net realized capital losses due principally to the significant decline in other-than-temporary impairments.

Partially offsetting these increases was a lower DAC benefit related to net realized capital losses of $2 million in 2010 compared to a benefit of $25 million in 2009.   Domestic Life Insurance premiums and other considerations declined primarily due to the sale of AIG Life Canada on April 1, 2009. Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses declined primarily due to expense reductions.   Domestic Life Insurance reported pre-tax income in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in the three months ended March 31, 2009 reflecting lower levels of net realized capital losses in 2010, due principally to a $291 million decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges.

(b)The sales and deposit amounts presented for payout annuities have been revised in the first quarter of 2010 to better align with how management views the business. Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.

Life  127      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  insurance premiums decreased primarily due to lower Domestic Life Insurance financial strength ratings while fixed annuity sales declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Payout annuity sales increased as a result of improved structured settlement, immediate annuity and terminal funding sales.

There were no unlockings in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010. Unlockings in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 primarily were the result of reductions in the long-term growth assumptions for group retirement products and individual variable annuities and deteriorating equity market conditions early in 2009.   Partially offsetting these benefits were:   •reduced DAC and SIA benefits of $322 million from lower net realized capital losses; and   •a decrease in investment income due to lower reserves and assets in the GIC and fixed annuity blocks. As the GIC block is in runoff, AIG anticipates reserve and asset declines in future periods.   Pre-tax income for Domestic Retirement Services reflected lower levels of net realized capital losses principally from lower other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.2 billion, partially offset by an increase of $853 million related to derivative fair value losses on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives used to economically hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves.  128      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Domestic Retirement Services Sales and Deposits  The following table presents the account value rollforward for Domestic Retirement Services:                         Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009            Group retirement products                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 63,419    $ 56,861        Deposits – annuities      1,254      1,228        Deposits – mutual funds      354      401              Total Deposits      1,608      1,629        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (1,676 )    (1,669 )      Death benefits      (73 )    (68 )            Net inflows (outflows)      (141 )    (108 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      1,591      (1,889 )          Balance, end of period    $ 64,869    $ 54,864            Individual fixed annuities                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 47,202    $ 48,394        Deposits      1,153      1,474        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (905 )    (2,369 )      Death benefits      (370 )    (433 )            Net inflows (outflows)      (122 )    (1,328 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      467      464            Balance, end of period    $ 47,547    $ 47,530            Individual variable annuities                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 24,637    $ 23,593        Deposits      357      262        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (674 )    (732 )      Death benefits      (120 )    (110 )            Net inflows (outflows)      (437 )    (580 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      666      (1,516 )          Balance, end of period    $ 24,866    $ 21,497            Total Domestic Retirement Services                  Balance, beginning of year    $ 135,258    $ 128,848        Deposits      3,118      3,365        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (3,255 )    (4,770 )      Death benefits      (563 )    (611 )            Net inflows (outflows)      (700 )    (2,016 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      2,724      (2,941 )            Balance, end of year, excluding runoff      137,282      123,891        Individual annuities runoff      4,579      4,898        GICs runoff      8,427      11,928            Balance at end of period    $ 150,288    $ 140,717            General and separate account reserves and mutual funds                    General account reserve    $ 95,400    $ 100,243        Separate account reserve      46,639      34,513            Total general and separate account reserves      142,039      134,756        Group retirement mutual funds      8,249      5,961            Total reserves and mutual funds    $ 150,288    $ 140,717             129      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Deposits for individual fixed annuities decreased primarily as a result of a slowdown in industry fixed annuity sales primarily due to less competitive rates and increased pricing on long term certificate of deposit products at certain banks.

Surrender rates and withdrawals have improved for individual fixed annuities and individual variable annuities as surrenders have returned to more normal levels.

Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations    AIG's Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include individual insurance and investment-oriented products such as term and whole life, endowments, term and whole life medical, cancer, fixed annuities and group products including life, medical and pension. The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services products are sold through career agents, independent producers, financial institutions and direct marketing channels.   In managing its Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses). Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) enhances the understanding of the operating performance of the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the table that follows.   Following the classification of AIA, ALICO, and Nan Shan as discontinued operations (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), AIG's remaining Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations are conducted through AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Ltd (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison).  130                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results        The following table presents Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services results:                              Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)              Premiums and other considerations    $ 864    $ 925      (7 )%      Net investment income      346      324      7        Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      726      700      4        Policy acquisition and other expenses      264      191      38            Pre-tax income before net realized capital losses      220      358      (39 )    Net realized capital losses      (135 )    (486 )    -            Pre-tax income (loss)    $ 85    $ (128 )    - %            AIG's foreign life operations transact business solely in Japan and therefore Premiums and other considerations reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and from changes in the Yen to U.S. dollar translation exchange rate.  The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Premiums and other considerations:                     Three Months Ended March 31,   2010 vs. 2009            Decrease in original currency*      (5.6 )%    Foreign exchange effect     (1.0 )          Decline as reported in U.S. dollars      (6.6 )%             *Computed using a constant exchange rate each period.   Premiums and other considerations declined due to lower in-force business as a result of surrenders and low sales volumes throughout 2009. Net investment income increased modestly due to higher returns from partnerships and mutual funds. The increase in policy acquisition and other expenses resulted from $74 million of lower DAC benefit, net of unearned revenue liability, related to higher realized capital losses in 2010 compared to a year ago.   Pre-tax income before net realized capital losses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services declined primarily due to the lower DAC benefit and decline of in-force business. Those declines were partially offset by the increase in net investment income.   Pre-tax income for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services reflected a decline in net realized capital losses due principally to a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairments.       Foreign Life Insurance and Retirement Services Sales    As a consequence of the classification of AIA, ALICO and Nan Shan as discontinued operations, the segment is now comprised of Japan operations. In managing the Japan operations, management analyzes sales performance on an annualized new business premium basis. Annualized new business premiums represent the amount of premium expected to be collected over a twelve month period and also include 10 percent of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products.  The following table summarizes annualized new business premiums for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Life    $ 72    $ 63     14 %    Medical      53      45     18      Annuity      33      27     22            Total    $ 158    $ 135     17 %           131      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Sales are transacted primarily in yen and therefore annualized new business premiums reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and from changes in the Yen/U.S. dollar translation exchange rate. Annualized new business premiums measured on a constant exchange rate basis are as follows:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Life    $ 65    $ 58      12 %    Medical      48      41      17      Annuity      30      24      25            Total    $ 143    $ 123      16 %            Life sales increased as independent producers have gradually returned to selling products of AIG Star and AIG Edison. Medical sales growth was supported by the launch of new products early in 2010, resulting in increased sales by both the captive agent and independent producer channels. Annuity sales increased due to a high rate of recapture of maturing annuities driven by a strong Yen exchange rate, and by gradually improving sales from banks that had previously suspended sales of products of AIG Star and AIG Edison.       Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs    DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment-type products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet with DAC and amortized over the life of the business similar to DAC.       The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC/VOBA:                           Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009            Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services                  Balance at beginning of year    $ 11,098    $ 14,447        Acquisition costs deferred      233      282        Amortization charged to pre-tax income      (267 )    (463 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities      (422 )    (503 )      Decrease due to foreign exchange      (1 )    (15 )      Consolidation and eliminations      48      54            Balance at end of period    $ 10,689    $ 13,802            Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services                  Balance at beginning of year    $ 24,792    $ 26,166        Acquisition costs deferred      169      204        Amortization charged to pre-tax income      (129 )    (56 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities      (32 )    (12 )      Decrease due to foreign exchange      (84 )    (64 )      Other      -      (10 )      Activity of discontinued operations      (184 )    (568 )      Reclassified to Assets of businesses held for sale      (20,925 )    -            Balance at end of period    $ 3,607    $ 25,660              As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market  132      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG's DAC and VOBA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG's results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.       Financial Services Operations    AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital markets, and consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations.       Aircraft Leasing    AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.       Capital Markets    Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and engaged in borrowing activities that involve issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into GIAs. AIGFP has continued to unwind its businesses and portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — AIGFP Wind-down.   Historically, AIG's Capital Markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. AIGFP has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. Revenues and pre-tax income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of AIGFP's assets and liabilities and by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the comparative period.       Consumer Finance    AIG's Consumer Finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives most of its revenues from finance charges assessed on real estate loans, secured and unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables.   AIG's foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. At March 31, 2010, AIGCFG had operations in Argentina, Poland, Taiwan, India and Colombia. During 2009 and through April 30, 2010, AIG has completed the sale of the AIGCFG operations in China, Colombia, Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico, Hong Kong, Brazil, Russia and Taiwan. AIG has also entered into contracts to sell the AIGCFG operations in Argentina, India and Poland.  133      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Financial Services Results        Financial Services results were as follows:                              Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Revenues:                          Aircraft Leasing    $ 882    $ 1,281      (31 )%      Capital Markets      (234 )    (969 )    -        Consumer Finance      779      813      (4 )      Other, including intercompany adjustments      81      140      (42 )          Total    $ 1,508    $ 1,265      19 %          Pre-tax income (loss):                          Aircraft Leasing    $ (81 )  $ 316      - %      Capital Markets      (298 )    (1,121 )    -        Consumer Finance      (25 )    (306 )    -        Other, including intercompany adjustments      (35 )    (19 )    -            Total    $ (439 )  $ (1,130 )    - %            Financial Services reported a lower pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the following:    •AIGFP reported a pre-tax loss of $298 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion during the first quarter of 2009. AIGFP reported unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $119 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 and unrealized market valuation losses of $452 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009. The operating results in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 include a net loss of $49 million and a net gain of $1.8 billion, respectively, representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including a credit valuation adjustment loss of $113 million and a credit valuation adjustment gain of $106 million, respectively, reflected in Unrealized market valuation gains (losses) on AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. Interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios were significantly lower during the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.   •ILFC reported a pre-tax loss of $81 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 due to impairment charges taken primarily on aircraft under contract to be sold subsequent to March 31, 2010. ILFC signed an agreement to sell 53 aircraft. Due to current market conditions, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses aggregating $347 million and operating lease related charges aggregating $84 million related to those aircraft under contract to sell and two aircraft that are subject to a letter of intent between ILFC and a potential buyer. These charges more than offset the benefit from a larger fleet and lower administrative expenses.   •Consumer Finance operations reported a decrease in pre-tax losses of $281 million primarily due to improvement in AGF results. AGF's pre-tax loss decreased primarily from a decline in provision for loan losses as a result of amounts provided for allowance for loan losses in first quarter 2009; foreign exchange gains on AGF's foreign currency denominated debt; lower interest expense due to lower average debt; and lower operating expenses due to management expense reductions across all AGF operations. These favorable variances were partially offset by a decline in AGF's finance charges reflecting the 2009 sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF's liquidity management efforts.    Capital Markets Results   AIGFP reported a lower pre-tax loss in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios along with a market valuation gain in 2010 compared to a loss in 2009 on its super senior credit default swap portfolio. These positive results were partially offset by the significant decrease related to the net effect of  134      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities. For a further discussion, see Executive Overview — 2010 Business Outlook — Financial Services — Capital Markets.   The principal components of AIGFP's valuation gains and losses recognized on its super senior credit default swap portfolio were as follows:    •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $7 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $358 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 as a result of a reduced portfolio size and shorter maturities.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $158 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to unrealized market valuation losses of $809 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $33 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on regulatory capital prime residential mortgage transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one counterparty notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its prime residential mortgage transactions. With respect to these two transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transaction early and is required to pay fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final maturity. Because these two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final legal maturities, there is value to AIGFP due to the counterparty paying its contractual fees beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through the final maturity date. The gain was more than offset by losses on the mezzanine tranches of those transactions.    See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.   During the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, AIGFP:    •recognized a gain of $17 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio; and   •incurred interest charges of $521 million compared to $933 million relating to intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation.   The following table presents AIGFP's credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) (excluding intercompany transactions):                          (in millions)                         Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities                  Three Months Ended March 31, 2010                      Bond trading securities   $ 823    Notes and bonds payable   $ (196 )      Loans and other assets     46    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     (249 )    Derivative assets     (57 )  GIAs     (145 )                 Other liabilities     (37 )              Derivative liabilities*     (234 )                Increase in assets   $ 812    Increase in liabilities   $ (861 )              Net pre-tax decrease to Other income    $ (49 )                      Three Months Ended March 31, 2009                      Bond trading securities   $ (1,131 )  Notes and bonds payable   $ 644        Loans and other assets     (48 )  Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     604      Derivative assets     441    GIAs     451                   Other liabilities     104                Derivative liabilities*     722                  Decrease in assets   $ (738 )  Decrease in liabilities   $ 2,525                Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 1,787                         *Includes super senior credit default swap portfolio.  135      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  AIGFP's pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 includes a net loss representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $113 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The loss was primarily the result of tightening of AIG's credit spreads during the first quarter, and was partially offset by the continued tightening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant segment of AIGFP's investment portfolio.   AIGFP's operating loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2009 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $106 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. The gain in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily the result of significant widening in AIG's credit spreads during the quarter, and was partially offset by continued widening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant component of AIGFP's investment portfolio.       Other Operations    AIG's Other operations includes results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, and results from noncore businesses.   AIG's Parent & Other operations consist primarily of interest expense, restructuring costs, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation related charges and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses.   Noncore businesses include results of certain businesses that have been divested or are being wound down or repositioned.  136                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Other Results    The pre-tax income (loss) of AIG's Other operations was as follows:                              Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)   2010   2009   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Parent & Other:                          Interest income    $ 588    $ 976      (40 )%        Accrued and compounding interest      (194 )    (708 )    -          Amortization of prepaid commitment asset      (639 )    (822 )    -              Total interest expense on FRBNY Credit Facility(a)      (833 )    (1,530 )    -        Other interest expense      (540 )    (546 )    -        Unallocated corporate expenses      (83 )    (63 )    -        Restructuring expenses      (97 )    (120 )    -        Change in fair value of ML III(b)      -      (1,940 )    -        Net realized capital gains      285      732      (61 )      Net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses      (77 )    262      -        Other miscellaneous, net      112      172      (35 )          Total Parent & Other    $ (645 )  $ (2,057 )    - %          Noncore businesses:                          Mortgage Guaranty    $ 96    $ (480 )    - %      Change in fair value of ML III(b)      751      -      -        Noncore Asset Management      (463 )    (1,012 )    -        Other noncore insurance      (33 )    105      -            Total Noncore businesses    $ 351    $ (1,387 )    - %          Total Other operations    $ (294 )  $ (3,444 )    - %             (a)Includes interest expense of $183 million and $258 million for the first three months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, allocated to discontinued operations in consolidation. (b)Parent & Other contributed its equity interest in ML III to an AIG subsidiary, reported above in Noncore businesses, during the second quarter of 2009.   Parent & Other   Parent & Other pre-tax loss decreased primarily due to a decline in interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility and the reclassification of ML III to Noncore businesses in the second quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by lower interest income on intercompany loans, which is eliminated in consolidation and a decline in net realized capital gains. See Consolidated Results — Interest Expense herein for further discussion of the decline in interest expense.

Mortgage Guaranty reported pre-tax income of $96 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $480 million in 2009. This improvement reflected a decline in claim and claims adjustment expenses incurred of $794 million, offset in part by an amortization of the second-lien premium deficiency reserve of $222 million in the first quarter of 2009. Domestic first-lien and second-lien businesses reported pre-tax income of $19 million and $67 million respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 which was $423 million and $104 million, respectively, higher than the three months ended March 31, 2009. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects the decline in loss and loss expenses of $414 million for first liens and $343 million for second liens. The improved operating results correspond to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in both the first- and second-lien products, higher mortgage cure rates on existing first-lien delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties. These claims and counterclaims allege breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud among other allegations.   UGC has found increased occurrences of fraudulent claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly related to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations have resulted in increased loan rescissions and increased claims denials (collectively referred to as rescissions). UGC rescinded $58 million of claims on first lien business during the first quarter of 2010. UGC expects this increased rescission activity to continue during 2010 and to affect its financial results, but cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact from these rescissions. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans, consistent with industry practice.   In December 2009, UGC entered into two stock purchase agreements for the sale of its Canadian and Israel operations. The Israel transaction closed on January 21, 2010 and the Canadian transaction closed on April 16, 2010.   UGC's domestic first-lien mortgage risk in force totaled $26.1 billion as of March 31, 2010 and the 60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans was 18.7 percent (based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice) compared to domestic first-lien mortgage risk in force of $27.1 billion and a delinquency ratio of 12.4 percent at March 31, 2009.   The second-lien risk in force at March 31, 2010 totaled $2.5 billion compared to $2.9 billion of risk in force at March 31, 2009. Risk in force represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions.   Change in Fair Value of ML III   Gains in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 resulted from improvements in valuation, primarily resulting from the shortening of weighted average life from 9.6 years to 9.0 years, and the narrowing of credit spreads by approximately 128 basis points. Positively affecting the fair value was a decrease in projected credit losses in the underlying collateral securities.   Noncore Asset Management Operations   AIG's Noncore Asset Management operations include the results of the MIP program and Institutional Asset Management businesses.  138      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  On March 26, 2010, AIG completed the sale of its third party asset management business. The results of operations from January 1 through the closing of the sale are included in the Institutional Asset Management results. Subsequent to the sale of AIG's third party asset management business, the revenues of the Institutional Asset Management business (excluding AIG Global Real Estate) are derived from providing asset management services to AIG and its subsidiaries. Both AIG Global Real Estate and the MIP's operating results are impacted by performance in the credit, equity and real estate markets.       MIP Results   The MIP reported a lower pre-tax loss due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments due primarily to the improved credit environment and the adoption of the new accounting standard on other-than-temporary impairments. The results were also affected by the discontinuation of hedge accounting in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the novation of certain intercompany derivative transactions with AIGFP to another AIG subsidiary, AIG Markets, which is part of Institutional Asset Management. These novations were done in conjunction with the wind-down of AIGFP. The discontinuation of hedge accounting resulted in additional income statement volatility which will continue for the foreseeable future until hedge accounting is reestablished. Residual balances from de-designated hedges will be amortized prospectively into operating income.   AIG enters into derivative arrangements to hedge the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs. Further, the MIP invests in short single name credit default swaps in order to obtain unfunded credit exposure.       Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management recognized higher pre-tax operating losses primarily resulting from higher real estate impairments and the negative impact of AIG's narrowing credit spreads on the valuation of derivative liabilities held through AIG Markets. These losses were partially offset by lower operating losses on investments originally acquired for warehouse purposes, as many of these investments have been divested, and lower unrealized carried interest losses.   Real estate impairments of $309 million during 2010 were incurred in the direct investment portfolio as well as through real estate joint ventures as a result of continued pressure on real estate values, occupancy rates and leasing activity. Approximately $37 million of these impairments was included in noncontrolling interests, which is not part of pre-tax income (loss). The availability of refinancing and required capital has caused management to reduce the estimated time period before sale for certain investments, resulting in impairments. AIG Markets acts as a derivative intermediary transacting with AIG and its subsidiaries and the third parities.   Other Noncore Insurance Businesses   Other noncore insurance businesses include the operating results of the following divested businesses through the date of their sale.    •Transatlantic    Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis both in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk.   On June 10, 2009, AIG closed a secondary public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock owned directly and indirectly by AIG for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. At the close of the public offering, AIG indirectly retained 13.9 percent of the Transatlantic common stock issued and outstanding. As a result, AIG deconsolidated Transatlantic, which resulted in a $1.4 billion reduction in Noncontrolling interests, a component of Total equity. On March 15, 2010, AIG closed a secondary public    139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries    offering of 8,466,693 shares of Transatlantic common stock owned by American Home Assurance Company, a subsidiary of AIG, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $452 million.    •21st Century      On July 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of 21st Century Insurance Group and the Agency Auto Division (excluding AIG Private Client Group).    •HSB    On March 31, 2009, AIG closed the sale of HSB, the parent company of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company.         Critical Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:    •AIG's ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding going concern considerations;   •liability for general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses;   •future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;   •recoverability of DAC;   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;   •the allowance for finance receivable losses;   •flight equipment recoverability;   •other-than-temporary impairments of investments;   •goodwill impairment;   •liability for legal contingencies;   •estimates with respect to income taxes;   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps and AIG's interests in ML II and ML III (Maiden Lane Interests);   •classification of entities as discontinued operations; and   •measurement of the fair values of the assets and liabilities including noncontrolling interests related to acquisitions.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. Refer to the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on AIG's accounting estimates.       Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses   AGF estimates its allowance for finance receivable losses primarily using migration analysis and the Monte Carlo technique applied to sub-portfolios of large numbers of relatively small homogenous accounts. Both techniques are historically-based statistical techniques that attempt to predict the future amount of losses for existing pools of finance receivables. AGF adjusts the amounts determined by migration and Monte Carlo for  140      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  AGF management's estimate of the effects of model imprecision, any changes to its underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including the levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.   AGF uses its internal data of net charge-offs and delinquency by sub-portfolio as the basis to determine the historical loss experience component of its allowance for finance receivable losses. AGF used monthly bankruptcy statistics, monthly unemployment statistics, and various other monthly or periodic economic statistics published by departments of the U.S. government and other economic statistics providers to determine the economic component of its allowance for finance receivable losses.   AGF also establishes troubled debt restructuring (TDR) reserves for impaired loans, which are included in its allowance for finance receivable losses. The allowance for finance receivable losses related to AGF's TDRs is calculated in homogeneous aggregated pools of impaired loans that have common risk characteristics. AGF establishes its allowance for finance receivable losses related to its TDRs by calculating the present value (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate prior to modification) of all expected cash flows less the recorded investment in the aggregated pool. AGF uses certain assumptions to estimate the expected cash flows from its TDRs. The primary assumptions for AGF's model are prepayment speeds, default rates, and severity rates.       Goodwill Impairment:   Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. As a result of entering into the ALICO Stock Purchase Agreement, AIG performed a goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2010 for ALICO and separately for the businesses to be retained that previously composed the Japan & Other reporting unit.   The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.   Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG's reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit's fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit's peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. As part of the impairment test, management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all of AIG's reporting units with AIG's market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values.   If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess.   In connection with the announced sale of ALICO on March 7, 2010 and management's decision that ALICO met the held-for-sale criteria on March 31, 2010, total goodwill of $4.6 billion associated with the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Japan & Other reporting unit was allocated among ALICO and the Japan & Other businesses to be retained based on their relative fair values as of March 31, 2010. This resulted in $3.3 billion and $1.3 billion of goodwill being allocated to ALICO and the retained businesses, respectively. Management tested goodwill for impairment in both groups and determined the fair values of ALICO and the retained businesses exceeded book value at March 31, 2010, by 1 percent and 51 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired.  141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  The fair value of ALICO used to test goodwill for impairment was determined by AIG by considering, among other information, a third-party valuation at March 31, 2010 of the announced proceeds from the sale of ALICO to MetLife. Given the significance of the equity component of the consideration, the fair value of ALICO is sensitive to the market value and volatility of MetLife common stock, the risk-free interest rate yield curve and discount rate assumptions used in estimating fair value. Given that the amount of estimated fair value of ALICO only exceeded the book value by 1 percent, a relatively modest change in any of these assumptions could have resulted in a potential impairment of the goodwill allocated to ALICO, ranging from zero to $3.3 billion. The evaluation of the potential impairment is an ongoing requirement. As such, an increase in the net assets of ALICO through future operating or comprehensive income generation could result in impairment when compared to the fair value of consideration at that future time.   AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances, including ALICO's operating results and level of net assets and the performance of MetLife's common stock, that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.       Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets:   At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, AIG recorded a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $8.2 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized (a likelihood of more than 50 percent). Realization of AIG's net deferred tax asset depends upon its ability to generate sufficient earnings from transactions expected to be completed in the near future and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset, but does not depend on projected future operating income.   When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax asset at March 31, 2010, AIG considered all available evidence, including:    •the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses;   •transactions completed, including the sale of the Otemachi building in Tokyo, and the sales of AIA and ALICO expected to be completed in 2010;   •the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards; and   •tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset.    Estimates of future taxable income generated from specific transactions and tax planning strategies discussed above could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG's consolidated financial condition or its results of operations for an individual reporting period.       U.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries:   Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes incurred on potential dispositions, as well as AIG's reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.       Measurement of the Fair Values of the Assets Acquired, Liabilities Assumed, and Noncontrolling Interests of Fuji   On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Chartis International subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji. The acquisition of the additional voting shares for $145 million increased Chartis' total voting ownership interest in Fuji from 41.7 percent to 54.8 percent, which resulted in Chartis obtaining control of Fuji.  142      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Chartis' acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest in Fuji were recorded at their respective acquisition date estimated fair values. The fair values were determined based on information available to Chartis. Chartis is in the process of obtaining appraisals to support the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Therefore, the fair values are provisional and subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date as information relative to closing date fair values become available. The assumptions used in determining the provisional fair values are subject to a significant amount of sensitivity, which may result in significant differences between the estimated fair values recorded as of March 31, 2010 and the appraisals. Upon completion of the appraisals, AIG will adjust the allocated acquisition price for any significant differences to the provisional amounts. An adjustment of the allocated acquisition price may also occur if new information on Fuji becomes known or discovered during the allocation period, the period of time required to identify and measure the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination.   Based on the fair values assigned to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests, Chartis recorded an unallocated purchase price of $581 million in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Chartis is in the process of reassessing the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Upon completion of the reassessment process, Chartis will adjust the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for any significant differences to the provisional fair values. Upon final determination of fair values, AIG may recognize a bargain purchase gain, which could be substantial. It is anticipated that any gain recognized will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax, since such gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon sale of the Fuji shares.

Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview   The following table presents the fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination:                        At March 31, 2010 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 265     91 %    Fair value based on internal sources     26     9            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)   $ 291     100 %             (a)Includes $19 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes. (b)Includes available for sale, trading and securities lending invested collateral securities.   See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.  143                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability.   At March 31, 2010, AIG classified $35.9 billion and $9.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.2 percent and 1.2 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at March 31, 2010. At December 31, 2009, AIG classified $38.9 billion and $13.9 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.6 percent and 1.9 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.       Level 3 Transfers    During the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, AIG transferred into Level 3 approximately $1.2 billion of assets, primarily representing investments in certain ABS, RMBS and CMBS, which coincided with a decrease in market transparency and downward credit migration of these securities, and investments in private placement corporate debt securities, for which pricing adjustments were made to reflect an additional risk premium not captured in the matrix pricing. In addition certain municipal bonds related to SunAmerica Affordable Housing partnerships were transferred into Level 3 based on limitations on market activity and related input for their valuation. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, AIG transferred approximately $1.1 billion of assets out of Level 3. These transfers out of Level 3 primarily related to investments in certain ABS and RMBS and investments in private placement corporate debt. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about transfers into and out of Level 3.       Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    AIG values its assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3.   Private equity and real estate fund investments: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price, i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset. Subsequently, they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. AIG considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement.   Corporate bonds and private placement debt: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued using market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads). When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models using yield curves observed from indices or credit default swap spreads.  144      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Certain RMBS and CMBS: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles considering remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations, or discounted cash flow techniques.   Certain ABS — non-mortgage: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued based on external price/spread data. When position-specific external price data are not observable, the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities.   CDOs: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued based on external price/spread data from independent third parties, dealer quotations, matrix pricing, the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model or a combination of these methods.   Interests in the Maiden Lane Interests: At their inception, ML II and ML III were valued at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. Subsequently, Maiden Lane Interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the Maiden Lane Interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool. The implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with AIG's interests in the capital structure of the respective entities. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.   The fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the Maiden Lane Interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of the Maiden Lane Interests. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.   Refer to Note 5 for sensitivity analysis disclosures with respect to the Maiden Lane Interests.   AIGFP's Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.

As a result, an $8 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, AIGFP also made a payment of $10 million to its counterparty with respect to a Multi-sector CDO. Upon payment, a $10 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized.

Through April 30, 2010, AIGFP had also received a formal termination notice with respect to an additional $11.6 billion in net notional amount with an effective termination date in 2010. AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of March 31, 2010, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 1.89 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of Basel I that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by Basel II. It was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from Basel I to Basel II by the end of the two-year adoption period on December 31, 2009, after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these CDS transactions, except in a small number of specific instances. However, in 2009, the Basel Committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the Basel I capital floors beyond the end of 2009, although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various European Central Banking districts. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio increased as of March 31, 2010 by 0.5 years from December 31, 2009 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of $33.1 billion. Where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the Basel I extension will be effective. Where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early, AIGFP has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits as a result of the extension of the Basel I capital floor announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions.   In addition, as of March 31, 2010, AIG had expected $304 million of Regulatory Capital CDS transactions to terminate early between April 1, 2010 and April 30, 2010. Of that amount, none had been called. The counterparties to these transactions continue to receive favorable regulatory benefits as a result of the extension of the Basel I capital floor. Since all of these counterparties retain the right to terminate the transactions early, the expected maturity for these transactions has been extended by one year.  147      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Included in the Regulatory Capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its Prime Residential Mortgage transactions with a combined net notional amount of $29.7 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010. With respect to these transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay AIG fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity. Since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities, there is value to AIGFP representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through to the final contractual maturity date. The fair value of these two super senior transactions as of March 31, 2010 was a derivative asset of $170 million. With respect to these two transactions, AIGFP has also written CDS transactions on the mezzanine tranches of these portfolios; however, the majority of the transactions on the mezzanine tranches were hedged by AIGFP with other third party CDS transactions. The fair value of the net derivative liability for all mezzanine tranches (including hedge transactions) increased from $143 million as of December 31, 2009 to $214 million as of March 31, 2010. For more information on AIGFP collateral calls, see Collateral Calls below.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the three-month period ended March 31, 2010 other than (1) for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and (2) for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.

As a result of participation ratios and replenishment rights, the attachment point may not always be computed by dividing net notional amount by gross transaction notional amount. (b)Represents realized losses incurred by the transaction (defaulted amounts less amounts recovered) from inception through March 31, 2010 expressed as a percentage of the initial gross transaction notional amount. (c)Delinquency information is not provided to AIGFP for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of these transactions. However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to AIGFP for such referenced pools.   All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In  149      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In virtually all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for a significant majority of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIG receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower, notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. For example, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values, and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. The two pools containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 40.00 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The average number of loans in each pool is over 4,800. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. These transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at March 31, 2010. Three other pools, with a total net notional amount of $2.4 billion, have non-investment grade percentages greater than 35.00 percent, each with a remaining life to maturity of 16.0 years. These pools have realized losses of 0.16 percent from inception through March 31, 2010 and have current weighted average attachment points of 32.54 percent. Approximately 0.47 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 0.00 percent to 2.86 percent.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.  150      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on approximately 64.24 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.08 percent to 3.49 percent, averaging 0.86 percent. For all but three transactions, which comprised less than 1.50 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.22 percent and ranged from 0.00 percent to 2.42 percent. The default rate on the remaining three transactions ranged from 4.53 percent to 16.71 percent. The subordination on these three transactions ranged from 34.51 percent to 47.54 percent.   For all regulatory capital transactions, where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses, and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers, and information available from rating agencies, governments, and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.

In certain cases, simultaneously with the exercise of the 2a-7 Puts by AIGFP's counterparties, AIGFP accessed financing arrangements previously entered into with such counterparties, pursuant to which the counterparties remained the legal owners of the underlying CDO securities. However, these securities were reported as part of AIGFP's investment portfolio as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Most of these underlying CDO securities were later acquired by ML III from AIGFP's counterparties.

As a result of participation ratios and partial terminations, the attachment point may not always be computed by dividing net notional amount by gross notional amount.   In a number of instances, the level of subordination with respect to individual CDOs has increased since inception relative to the overall size of the CDO. While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

Collateral   Most of AIGFP's credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.   Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of March 31, 2010, 61.5 percent of AIGFP's regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) linked to AIG's credit rating and 38.5 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreement (Master Agreement) or similar agreement, under which the aggregate Exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty, and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans, or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.  Expected Loss Models—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.   156      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Negotiated Amount—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   The following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than AIGFP's super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended:                           (in millions)   December 31, 2009   March 31, 2010   April 30, 2010            Reference to market indices   $ 60   $ 28   $ 36      Expected loss models     20     19     19      Negotiated amount     230     219     220            Total   $ 310   $ 266   $ 275              Arbitrage Portfolio — Multi-Sector CDOs   In the CDS transactions, with physical settlement provisions, in respect of multi-sector CDOs, the standard CSA provisions for the calculation of Exposure have been modified, with the Exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying CDO security, rather than the replacement value of the transaction. As of any date, the "market value" of the relevant CDO security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such CDO security in a market transaction on such date, while the "replacement value of the transaction" is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation (e.g., the CDO security). In cases where a formula is utilized, a transaction-specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of Exposure, which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted. These thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of AIG and/or the reference obligations, with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings. For the large majority of counterparties to these transactions, the Master Agreement and CSA cover non-CDS transactions (e.g., interest rate and cross currency swap transactions) as well as CDS transactions. As a result, the amount of collateral to be posted by AIGFP in relation to the CDS transactions will be added to or offset by the amount, if any, of the Exposure AIG has to the counterparty on the non-CDS transactions.   Arbitrage Portfolio — Corporate Debt/CLOs   All of AIGFP's corporate arbitrage transactions are subject to CSAs. None of these transactions (measured by net notional amount) contains a special collateral posting provision, but each is subject to a Master Agreement that includes a CSA. These transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same Master Agreement and CSA, with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard CSA procedures outlined above. None of these transactions, although subject to a Master Agreement and CSA, has specific valuation and threshold provisions.   Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.   From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFP's estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of  157      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences, including at the present time. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                           (in millions)   December 31, 2009   March 31, 2010   April 30, 2010            Regulatory capital   $ 310   $ 266   $ 275      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO     3,715     3,683     3,606      Arbitrage – corporate     565     503     538            Total   $ 4,590   $ 4,452   $ 4,419              The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the severe market disruption, lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future.   Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio   Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased 0.90 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first quarter of 2010. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi- sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $7.6 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at March 31, 2010, a BET value is available for $4.8 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $2.8 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $4.8 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  158      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at March 31, 2010 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                             Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at March 31, 2010         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS PRIME   RMBS ALT-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     42 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (299 ) $ (11 ) $ (25 ) $ (134 ) $ (82 ) $ (32 ) $ (15 )                Decrease of 5 points     258     12     24     103     83     13     23            Weighted         Increase of 1 year     49     1     6     38     -     1     3        average life     5.98 years   Decrease of 1 year     (90 )   (3 )   (3 )   (86 )   4     (1 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     23%   Increase of 10%     (38 )   (1 )   (1 )   (10 )   (23 )   (1 )   (2 )                Decrease of 10%     41     -     1     16     23     -     1            Diversity score(a)     13   Increase of 5     (9 )                                                 Decrease of 5     31                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     13                                                   (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  160      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: General Insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Matched Investment Program. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance & retirement services companies, as well as in the MIP portfolio, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the Commercial Insurance Group historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the Commercial Insurance Group's current risk/return and tax objectives, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by Foreign General Insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk, and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not mark-to-market its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At March 31, 2010, approximately 78 percent of the fixed maturity securities were in domestic entities. Approximately 29 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 11 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspectives for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2010, approximately 17 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 2 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately one third of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  161      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG's fixed maturity investments:                             March 31, 2010*   December 31, 2009            Rating:                    AAA      27 %    23 %      AA      24      24        A      21      28        BBB      19      17        Below investment grade      7      6        Non-rated      2      2            Total      100 %    100 %             *Excludes fixed maturity securities of businesses held for sale as of March 31, 2010.  162                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Available for Sale Investments  The following table presents the amortized cost or cost and fair value of AIG's available for sale securities:                                   (in millions)   Amortized Cost or Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Other-Than- Temporary Impairments in AOCI(a)            March 31, 2010                                    Bonds available for sale:                                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities    $ 4,777   $ 106   $ (27 ) $ 4,856   $ -        Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions      50,427     2,018     (292 )   52,153     -        Non-U.S. governments      23,305     725     (213 )   23,817     (1 )      Corporate debt      127,707     8,507     (1,862 )   134,352     14        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                                        RMBS      30,089     1,027     (3,897 )   27,219     (1,595 )        CMBS      10,869     256     (3,180 )   7,945     (451 )        CDO/ABS      7,242     324     (1,038 )   6,528     64              Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized      48,200     1,607     (8,115 )   41,692     (1,982 )          Total bonds available for sale(b)      254,416     12,963     (10,509 )   256,870     (1,969 )    Equity securities available for sale:                                      Common stock      2,511     1,770     (19 )   4,262     -        Preferred stock      635     103     (1 )   737     -        Mutual funds      1,736     102     (6 )   1,832     -            Total equity securities available for sale      4,882     1,975     (26 )   6,831     -            Total(c)    $ 259,298   $ 14,938   $ (10,535 ) $ 263,701   $ (1,969 )          December 31, 2009                                    Bonds available for sale:                                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities   $ 5,098   $ 174   $ (49 ) $ 5,223   $ -        Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions     52,324     2,163     (385 )   54,102     -        Non-U.S. governments     63,080     3,153     (649 )   65,584     (1 )      Corporate debt     185,188     10,826     (3,876 )   192,138     119        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                                        RMBS     32,173     991     (4,840 )   28,324     (2,121 )        CMBS     18,717     195     (5,623 )   13,289     (739 )        CDO/ABS     7,911     284     (1,304 )   6,891     (63 )            Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized     58,801     1,470     (11,767 )   48,504     (2,923 )          Total bonds available for sale(b)     364,491     17,786     (16,726 )   365,551     (2,805 )    Equity securities available for sale:                                      Common stock     4,460     2,913     (75 )   7,298     -        Preferred stock     740     94     (20 )   814     -        Mutual funds     1,264     182     (36 )   1,410     -            Total equity securities available for sale     6,464     3,189     (131 )   9,522     -            Total   $ 370,955   $ 20,975   $ (16,857 ) $ 375,073   $ (2,805 )            (a) Represents the amount of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income, which, starting on April 1, 2009, were not included in earnings.

Although the market value has improved and CMBS spreads have tightened during the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, the market value of the holdings continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.  168      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Investments in CDOs   The following table presents AIG's CDO investments, other than those of AIGFP, by collateral type:                                                     March 31, 2010   December 31, 2009      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Collateral Type:                                                                    Bank loans (CLO)    $ 1,884    $ 61    $ (495 )  $ 1,450      78 %  $ 2,015    $ 63    $ (596 )  $ 1,482      75%        Synthetic investment grade      116      87      (8 )    195      5      220      83      (21 )    282      8        Other      380      29      (97 )    312      16      443      27      (107 )    363      16        Subprime ABS      30      1      (25 )    6      1      33      1      (27 )    7      1            Total    $ 2,410    $ 178    $ (625 )  $ 1,963      100 %  $ 2,711    $ 174    $ (751 )  $ 2,134      100 %           The following table presents AIG's CDO investments, other than those of AIGFP, by credit rating:                                                     March 31, 2010   December 31, 2009      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Rating:                                                                    AAA    $ 216    $ 2    $ (25 )  $ 193      9 %  $ 326    $ 5    $ (42 )  $ 289      12 %      AA      151      1      (26 )    126      6      135      1      (29 )    107      5        A      813      23      (217 )    619      34      1,028      22      (311 )    739      38        BBB      690      22      (210 )    502      29      670      19      (214 )    475      25        Below investment grade      540      130      (147 )    523      22      550      108      (155 )    503      20        Non-rated      -      -      -      -      -      2      19      -      21      -            Total    $ 2,410    $ 178    $ (625 )  $ 1,963      100 %  $ 2,711    $ 174    $ (751 )  $ 2,134      100%                    Commercial Mortgage Loans   At March 31, 2010, AIG had direct commercial mortgage loan exposure of $14.8 billion, with $14.4 billion representing U.S. loan exposure.

With the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard on April 1, 2009, such severity loss charges subsequent to that date exclusively related to equity securities and other invested assets. In all prior periods, such charges primarily related to mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized securities, corporate debt securities of financial institutions and other equity securities. Notwithstanding AIG's intent and ability to hold such securities until they had recovered their cost or amortized cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.   Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.   In addition to the above severity losses, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 related to:    •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments and private equity investments.    With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.10 percent and 0.06 percent of Total equity in the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 were $92 million and $445 million, respectively.

See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Regulation    Directive 2002/87/EC (Directive) issued by the European Parliament provides that certain financial conglomerates with regulated entities in the European Union are subject to supplementary supervision. Pursuant to the Directive, the Commission Bancaire (the French banking regulator) was appointed as AIG's supervisory coordinator. From February 2007 until March 2010, with the approval of the Commission Bancaire, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) acted as AIG's equivalent supervisor, as permitted by the Directive in circumstances in which a financial conglomerate organized outside the European Union (such as AIG) has proposed to have one of its existing regulators recognized as its coordinator and such regulator's supervision is determined to be equivalent to that required by the Directive. Since March 2010, AIG has been in discussions with the Commission Bancaire regarding the possibility of proposing another of AIG's existing regulators as its equivalent supervisor.  174      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  For additional information concerning the regulation of AIG and its businesses, see Item 1. Business — Regulation in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Risk Management    For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Overview   AIG continues to focus on enhancing its risk management control environment, risk management processes and its enterprise risk management functions, at the board, corporate and individual business levels. AIG continues to explore process improvements and risk mitigation strategies, both at the corporate and business levels in an effort to minimize the capital and liquidity needs of AIG's local legal entities.       Credit Risk Management    AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark-to-market), deposits and letters of credit (both in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity:                         At March 31, 2010 Category   Risk Rating(a)   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity            Investment Grade:                    10 largest combined     A- (b)   112.9 %(c)      Single largest non-sovereign (financial institution)     BBB-     9.2        Single largest corporate     AA     3.3        Single largest sovereign     AAA     26.1      Non-Investment Grade:                    Single largest sovereign     BB-     2.0        Single largest non-sovereign     BB     0.6               (a)Reflects AIG's internal risk ratings. (b)Six of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions and four are to investment-grade rated sovereigns. Based on support from the US Government, the exposure to government-sponsored entities is included in the US Government total, rather than in financial institutions. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB- or its equivalent. (c)Exposure to the ten largest combined as a percentage of Total equity was 102.8 percent at December 31, 2009.   AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG defines its cross-border exposure to include both cross- border credit exposures and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Nine countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at that date, six were rated AAA, two were rated AA and one was rated A. The two largest sovereign exposures are to Bermuda and the United Kingdom.   In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG's single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms and insurance and reinsurance companies.  175      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity:                      At March 31, 2010   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity(a)            Industry Category:              Money Center / Global Bank Groups     82.6 %(b)      European Regional Financial Institutions     14.7        Global Life Insurance Companies     13.2        Global Reinsurance Companies     12.4        Asian Regional Financial Institutions     10.1        Supranational Banks     8.0        North American Based Regional Financial Institutions     7.7               (a)The table includes amounts related to AIA, ALICO and Nan Shan because their respective sales have not yet closed. (b)Exposure to Money Center/Global Bank Groups as a percentage of Total equity was 83.9 percent at December 31, 2009.   AIG's exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 34.0 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2010 compared to 33.5 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2009.   AIG also has a risk concentration through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG holds approximately $48.8 billion of tax-exempt and taxable securities issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories. A majority of these securities are held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property-casualty insurance companies. These securities are comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The average credit quality of these issuers is A-.   Currently, several states, local governments and other issuers are facing pressures on their budget revenues from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG's portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers is the State of California, of which AIG holds approximately $1.1 billion of general obligation bonds, $95.7 million of which are defeased, and which at March 31, 2010 was also the largest single issuer in AIG's municipal finance portfolio. Nevertheless, despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does not expect any significant defaults in portfolio holdings of municipal issuers.   On April 27, 2010 one nationally recognized statistical rating agency lowered its rating of the government of Greece to sub-investment grade. As of May 4, 2010, AIG holds sovereign bonds issued by the Greek government amounting to $1.03 billion, the majority of which is in ALICO and its subsidiaries. AIG also holds sovereign bonds issued by the governments of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland which collectively total approximately $2.0 billion. Although all are still investment grade, both Spain and Portugal were recently downgraded. The majority (approximately $1.2 billion) is held by ALICO and its subsidiaries.   The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. The CRC may adjust limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.  176                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2010, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  177      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Part II — OTHER INFORMATION        ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings    Included in Note 9(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       ITEM 1A. Risk Factors    The following updates the "Execution of Restructuring Plan" risk factor in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Significant conditions precedent must be satisfied in order to complete the AIA and ALICO sales on the agreed terms.    Completion of the AIA sale is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of a number of conditions precedent, including:    •the approval of the transaction by 75 percent of Prudential shareholders;   •the approval of the scheme of arrangement between Prudential and existing Prudential shareholders by The High Court of Justice in England and Wales;   •regulatory approvals in various foreign jurisdictions in connection with the acquisition by Prudential of the transferred businesses; and   •regulatory approvals in certain U.S. states and various foreign jurisdictions in connection with the acquisition by AIG of the securities consideration.    The ALICO sale also is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of similar regulatory approvals in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.   Any relevant regulatory body may refuse its approval or may seek to make its approval subject to compliance by Prudential or MetLife, as the case may be, with unanticipated or onerous conditions, or, even if approval is not required, the regulator may impose requirements on Prudential or MetLife or the local operations of the transferred businesses. Prudential or MetLife, as the case may be, may not agree to those requirements.   Because of the closing conditions applicable to each transaction, completion of either or both of the AIA sale and ALICO sale is not assured or may be delayed or, even if completed, may need to be significantly restructured.       Failure to complete the sales of AIA and ALICO could negatively affect AIG's businesses and financial results.    If the sale of AIA or ALICO is not completed, the ongoing businesses of AIG may be adversely affected and AIG will be subject to several risks, including the following:    •alternative plans to dispose of AIA or ALICO may be difficult to structure and may take extended periods of time to implement;   •AIG may not be able to realize equivalent value for AIA or ALICO under an alternative asset disposition plan;   •AIG will have incurred certain significant costs relating to the sales without receiving the benefits of the sales; and   •negative customer perception could adversely affect the ability of the retained businesses to compete for, or to win, new and renewal business in the marketplace.
