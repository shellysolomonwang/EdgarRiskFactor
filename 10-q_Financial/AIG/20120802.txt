Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and discussed throughout Part II, Item 7. MD&A and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on February 27, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively, and discussed throughout Exhibit 99.2, MD&A of AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2012 (collectively, the 2011 Annual Report).    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms AIG, the Company, we, us, and our mean AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries.        USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, representative, and most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations.   Management believes that the measures described at Results of Operations — Segment Results enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of the businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. Reconciliations of these measures to pre-tax income or unadjusted ratios, the most directly comparable measurements derived from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), are included in Results of Operations — Segment Results.        EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  This executive overview of this MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety, together with the 2011 Annual Report, for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks, and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  AIG reports its results of operations as follows:   •Chartis — Chartis offers property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses and individuals worldwide.

(AeroTurbine)).   •Other Operations — AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), Direct Investment book (including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP), Retained Interests (as defined below) and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).         PRIOR PERIOD REVISIONS  Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the following:   Accounting for Deferred Acquisition Costs   As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG retrospectively adopted an accounting standard on January 1, 2012 that amended the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts.   Changes in Fair Value of Derivatives   To align the presentation of Changes in fair value of derivatives with changes in the administration of AIG's derivatives portfolio, changes were made to the presentation within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for activity where Global Capital Markets executes transactions with third parties on behalf of AIG subsidiaries. Specifically, derivative activity where AIGFP is an intermediary for AIG subsidiaries, which historically has been reported in Other income, has been reclassified to Net realized capital gains (losses). Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  The impact to AIG shareholders' equity and Net income (loss) attributable to AIG previously reported in 2011 is summarized below:                    At December 31, (in millions)   2011            AIG shareholders' equity as previously reported   $ 104,951      Impact of adoption of new standard on AIG Shareholders' equity     (3,413 )          AIG shareholders' equity as currently reported   $ 101,538                                     (in millions)   Three Months Ended June 30, 2011   Six Months Ended June 30, 2011            Net income attributable to AIG as previously reported   $ 1,840   $ 2,109      Impact of adoption of new standard on Net income attributable to AIG     (4 )   1,024            Net income attributable to AIG as currently reported   $ 1,836   $ 3,133              Chartis Segment Changes   To align financial reporting with changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, certain products previously reported in Commercial Insurance were reclassified to Consumer Insurance. These revisions did not affect the total Chartis reportable segment results previously reported.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 87      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1.8 billion for both the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, and reflected the following:   •pre-tax income from insurance operations of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively;  •a decrease in fair value of AIG's interest in AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares of $493 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to an increase in fair value of $1.5 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2011;  •an increase in fair value of AIG's interest in ML III of $1.3 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2012 based in part on sales of ML III assets by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY) in the second quarter of 2012, compared to a decrease in fair value of $667 million in the three months ended June 30, 2011; and •an increase in estimated litigation liability of approximately $719 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 based on developments in several actions.    Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $6.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $484 million for the same period in 2011, primarily driven by the following:   •pre-tax income from insurance operations of $3.5 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to $2.2 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2011, which included catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion, largely arising from the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami in Japan (the Tohoku Catastrophe);  •increases in fair value of AIG's interest in AIA ordinary shares of $1.3 billion and $2.6 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively;  •increases in fair value of AIG's interest in ML III of $2.6 billion and $0.1 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively;  •an increase in estimated litigation liability of approximately $727 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 based on developments in several actions; and •a $3.3 billion charge, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the credit facility provided by the FRBNY(the FRBNY Credit Facility) in 2011.    Pre-tax income from insurance operations reflected Chartis' continued benefit from growth in higher value lines and geographies and improving pricing trends. Chartis results included net prior year adverse development of $137 million and $184 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively. Chartis is benefiting from higher interest income on fixed maturity securities driven by the redeployment of excess cash and short-term investments into longer term investments, the implementation of Chartis' investment strategy to reduce its concentration in non-taxable municipal instruments and increase higher yielding corporate and structured securities and an increase in maturing life settlement policies   SunAmerica is benefiting from its broad portfolio of innovative products, diverse and strong distribution relationships, and continued discipline in product pricing. SunAmerica 2012 results also benefited, in comparison, from the reinvestment of cash in 2011 and increase in base yields. Partially offsetting SunAmerica's improvements were lower returns from hedge funds and private equity investments.  88 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  In the first six months of 2012, AIG paid down in full the remaining preferred interests in the AIA Group Limited (AIA) special purpose vehicle (the AIA SPV, and such interests, the AIA SPV Preferred Interests) held by the Department of the Treasury. In addition, the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed two registered public offerings in March 2012 (the March Offering) and May 2012 (the May Offering, and together with the March Offering, the Equity Offerings) of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock).   In the March Offering, the Department of the Treasury sold approximately 207 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion. AIG purchased approximately 103 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the March Offering at the initial public offering price of $29.00 per share for an aggregate purchase amount of approximately $3.0 billion.   In the May Offering, the Department of the Treasury sold approximately 189 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $5.7 billion. AIG purchased approximately 66 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the May Offering at the initial public offering price of $30.50 per share for an aggregate purchase amount of approximately $2.0 billion.   As a result of the Department of the Treasury's sale of AIG Common Stock and AIG's purchase of shares in the Equity Offerings, ownership by the Department of the Treasury was reduced from approximately 77 percent to approximately 61 percent of the AIG Common Stock outstanding after the completion of the May Offering.   AIG expects that the Department of the Treasury will seek to further reduce its ownership interest in AIG over time through additional secondary offerings or open market sales. Depending upon market conditions, available capital resources and liquidity, and any repurchase authorization then available, AIG may determine to participate as a purchaser in such secondary offerings.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries herein for further discussion and other capital resources and liquidity developments.        OUTLOOK       PRIORITIES FOR 2012  AIG remains committed to its long-term aspirational goals and is focused on the following priorities for 2012:   •continuing to strengthen and grow AIG's core businesses;  •implementing a strategic alternative for ILFC through an initial public offering or sale;   •managing its capital and interest expense more efficiently;  •taking appropriate actions to prepare for scenarios under which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) would become AIG's regulator;  •continuing to build, strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure and control environment throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources; and •restructuring AIG's operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 89      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       REGULATORY  On October 18, 2011, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) published a second notice of proposed rulemaking and related interpretive guidance under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) regarding the designation of non-bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). On April 3, 2012, the FSOC formally adopted the rule in substantially the same form as proposed. The rule sets forth a three-stage determination process for designating non-bank SIFIs. In Stage 1, FSOC would apply a set of uniform quantitative thresholds to identify the nonbank financial companies that will be subject to further evaluation. AIG expects that the FSOC will make its Stage 1 identifications before the end of 2012. Based on its financial condition as of June 30, 2012, AIG would meet the criteria in Stage 1 and would be subject to further evaluation by the FSOC in the SIFI determination process. Because Stages 2 and 3 would involve qualitative judgment by the FSOC, AIG cannot predict whether it would be designated as a non-bank SIFI under the rule.   The SEC and the CFTC have adopted final rules defining major swap participant for purposes of Title VII of Dodd-Frank. The definitions contain quantitative tests to be applied on a quarterly basis. Based on these quantitative tests and the existing size of AIGFP's swap portfolio, it appears that both AIGFP and AIG Parent, as a guarantor of AIGFP's swaps, may need to register as major swap participants. However, interpretational issues remain with respect to the final rules, including the treatment of stable value contracts and the extra-territorial scope of the rules, and the precise time when the quantitative tests must be applied is uncertain. Accordingly, depending on the exact timing of the testing and the size of AIGFP's swap portfolio at that time, AIGFP and AIG Parent may not meet the quantitative tests for registration. If AIGFP and AIG Parent are required to register as major swap dealers, they will become subject to derivative transaction clearing, execution and reporting requirements, capital and margin requirements and business conduct rules.   AIG's insurance companies, like other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. State regulation relates primarily to financial condition as well as corporate conduct and market conduct activities; in particular, states have also become increasingly aggressive in using escheatment laws to seek recovery of unclaimed life insurance benefits. There are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations, and a review of insurance solvency regulation throughout the U.S. regulatory system, which could significantly affect AIG's insurance businesses. At the federal level, Dodd-Frank will subject AIG's insurance subsidiaries, investment advisors, broker-dealers and their affiliates to additional federal regulation. In addition, regulators and lawmakers around the world are developing recommendations to address issues such as financial group supervision, corporate governance, enterprise risk management, capital and solvency standards, and related issues, which could potentially affect AIG and its subsidiaries.   In March 2011, federal regulators, as required by Dodd-Frank, issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) in respect of which issuers of asset-backed securities would not be subject to certain risk retention requirements. The QRM definition included, among other standards, a maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80 percent for a home purchase transaction. The LTV is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan. The final regulations could adversely impact UGC's volume of domestic first-lien new insurance written, depending on the final definition of a QRM, the maximum LTV allowed and the benefit, if any, ascribed to private mortgage insurance. In July 2012, federal regulators indicated that the final QRM regulations will not be issued until after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalizes the Qualified Mortgage standards, expected sometime in 2013.  90 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       CHARTIS  Chartis expects that the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to negatively impact financial results through at least the next 12 months, although improving trends in certain key indicators may offset the effect of some of these challenges. Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, Chartis has observed positive pricing trends, particularly in its U.S. commercial business. Chartis expects that expansion in certain growth economies will trend higher than in developed countries, albeit at reduced levels than had been expected previously due to revised economic assumptions for some of these nations.   Strategy   Chartis continues to make progress with its strategy to grow higher value and less capital intensive lines of business, and to implement corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management reviews each of the businesses to evaluate their contribution to overall performance objectives.   Chartis seeks to provide value for people and businesses worldwide through the identification and efficient management of risk. In pursuing this mission and growing its intrinsic value, Chartis has established strategic initiatives in several key areas. Initiatives in these areas are helping Chartis direct its capital and resources to optimize financial results, while acknowledging that performance in these areas may vary from quarter to quarter depending on local market conditions, such as pricing and the effects of foreign exchange rates or changes in the investment environment.    •Business Mix Shift — Chartis seeks to continue to diversify its business portfolio, while retaining the flexibility to capitalize on sustainable profit in products and geographies of opportunity. Chartis believes that there is an opportunity to shift its current mix of business toward growth economy nations, such as China, India and Brazil, among others, and to higher value lines such as consumer business and less commoditized commercial lines.     •Commercial Insurance is effectively utilizing global underwriting and product best practices to target high value customers and geographies. Chartis is leveraging its significant global footprint and multinational capabilities to serve large and mid-sized businesses with cross-border operations. Commercial Insurance is also expanding its presence in the growth economy nations. In the Americas and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, Commercial Insurance expects to focus on the higher value lines within its portfolio and to capitalize on market opportunities.   •Consumer Insurance continues to grow its net premiums written in key markets and to expand internationally, particularly in growth economy nations. Consumer Insurance growth strategies span multiple distribution channels and include direct to consumer, agent, broker and affinity groups. In the Asia Pacific region, the acquisition of Fuji enables the continued introduction of a breadth of products across its distribution channels and customer base. In the Americas region, Consumer Insurance continues to focus its growth in niche areas, such as the high net worth market, geographic expansion in Latin America, and the implementation of a strategic group benefits partnership with American General Life Companies (American General). In the EMEA region, management expects modest growth and will continue to focus on profitable underwriting performance.   •Underwriting Excellence — Chartis is implementing enhanced pricing, risk selection and account management tools, and marketing analytics that it believes enable underwriters to better select and price risks. Further changes include greater actuarial involvement in product pricing and attachments, widespread utilization of pricing and predictive models, policy form changes, increased policy exclusions and fewer multi-year policies being offered. In 2011, as part of its ongoing initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines, Chartis ceased to actively write Excess Workers' Compensation business on a stand-alone basis. Based on this decision, Chartis includes this legacy line of business in Chartis Other.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 91      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Claims Best Practices — Chartis is continuing to focus on reducing the costs associated with claims by improving the effectiveness and efficiency in servicing its customers, thus improving its loss ratio. Chartis is placing emphasis on streamlining its claims operations, implementing effective technology and processes and the use of fraud detection tools to create a competitive advantage. Analyzing actuarial, underwriting, claims and legal data is helping Chartis develop its knowledge of the structural drivers of losses and improve pricing. Chartis is addressing these loss drivers proactively to mitigate their impact on reserve development and legal costs. Current accident year loss ratios have started to improve and Chartis expects this trend to continue. •Expense Discipline — To achieve expense reductions, Chartis plans to take advantage of its global footprint to improve efficiencies and expand the use of shared services to support regional businesses in strategic locations, reduce use of external services and negotiate preferred rates with vendors. As a result of the business mix shift to consumer products, higher value commercial products, and the investment in growth economy nations, policy acquisition expenses are expected to increase in the next 12 months. Chartis expects, however, that these changes will ultimately help generate business with more favorable underwriting results. Chartis continues to make strategic investments in systems processes and talent worldwide, which will increase expenses in the short-term, but should create additional value and greater efficiency in the future.    Capital Deployment   In 2012, Chartis expects to continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, executing underwriting strategies, implementing its global reinsurance strategy to improve capital ratios, increasing return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends.   Chartis continues to streamline its legal entity structure, to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. In 2012, Chartis completed 25 legal entity and branch restructuring transactions. In preparation for Solvency II compliance, on December 1, 2011, Chartis Ireland was merged into Chartis Europe Limited as the first step towards achieving a single Pan-European insurance carrier that will simplify the legal entity structure in Europe by the end of 2012, subject to regulatory approval.   Investments   For 2012, Chartis expects to continue to refine its investment strategy, which includes asset diversification and yield-enhancement opportunities that meet Chartis' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   See Segment Results — Chartis Operations — Chartis Results — Chartis Investing and Other Results and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.        SUNAMERICA  SunAmerica continues to pursue its goals of (i) expanding the breadth and depth of its distribution relationships, (ii) introducing innovative new products and product enhancements, (iii) disciplined life insurance underwriting and matching of assets and liability durations, (iv) maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and strong statutory surplus, (v) proactively managing expenses and, (vi) subject to regulatory approval, continuing to make distributions to AIG Parent. SunAmerica expects to continue to make progress on all of these efforts for the remainder of 2012.   Business Environment    •Effect of low interest rates — SunAmerica's businesses and the life and annuity industry in general continue to be affected by the current low interest rate environment. Low interest rates can affect the recoverability   92 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   and amortization rate of deferred acquisition costs (DAC). Continued low interest rates also put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect future sales of interest rate-sensitive products and reduce future profits. Products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate-adjustable may require increases in reserves if changes in estimates of future investment returns result in projected future losses. SunAmerica would not expect a DAC unlocking or an increase in reserves due to loss recognition in 2012 solely as a result of the low interest rate environment. However, because of the long-term nature of certain contracts for which reserving assumptions are established upon issuance of the contracts, small changes in certain of the original assumptions, particularly estimates of future invested asset returns, may cause large changes in the amount of reserve adequacy. In conjunction with the development of prudent and feasible programs that resulted in the utilization of capital loss carryforwards, in the first six months of 2012, SunAmerica sold approximately $8.9 billion of investments. These sales resulted in capital gains which enhanced statutory capital and effectively transferred $548 million of shadow loss recognition to actual loss recognition. Additional sales of such securities that would result in capital gains are contemplated for the remainder of 2012, which could result in additional loss recognition or reserve increases in future periods. See Results of Operations — Segment Results — SunAmerica Operations.    •Equity market volatility — Declines in the equity markets may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features and equity market volatility can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC. In amortizing DAC, value of new business acquired (VOBA) and sales inducement assets (SIA), SunAmerica uses a reversion to the mean methodology to account for fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business. Positive separate account returns could trigger a favorable unlocking, where the reversion to the mean assumption is reset. No unlocking is currently anticipated for 2012 solely as the result of positive market returns.    Organizational Realignment   On April 12, 2012, SunAmerica announced several key organizational structure and management changes intended to better serve the organization's distribution partners and customers. Key aspects of the new structure are distinct product divisions, shared annuity and life operations platforms and a unified all-channel distribution organization with access to all SunAmerica products. Beginning in 2013, SunAmerica expects to modify its presentation of results when organizational changes are implemented and all prior periods' presentations will be conformed.   SunAmerica intends to continue its efforts to consolidate its regulated insurance companies to implement a more efficient legal entity structure, while continuing to market products and services under currently existing brands. At the conclusion of this legal entity consolidation initiative, SunAmerica expects to reduce the number of its operating life insurance legal entities to three. Subject to receiving all necessary regulatory approvals, these legal entity mergers are targeted to be effective as of December 31, 2012.   Variable Annuities   SunAmerica variable annuity sales increased due to access to broad distribution, including several new distributors and reinstatement in SunAmerica's largest pre-financial crisis distribution partner, as well as its innovative product offerings. In addition, several competitors have scaled back or ceased selling variable annuity products in 2012. As a result of a broad distribution network and a more favorable competitive environment, SunAmerica expects variable annuity sales to remain strong in 2012.   SunAmerica has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts, caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. SunAmerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a significant portion of SunAmerica's interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, SunAmerica began purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce this interest rate risk exposure over time. In addition, in  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 93      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. 2010 SunAmerica indexed living benefit fees to market volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), reducing SunAmerica's exposure to changes in market volatility. Beginning in 2012, SunAmerica launched a new product offering with a volatility-controlled fund, which further reduces SunAmerica's risk related to market volatility while offering a competitive benefit. The volatility-controlled fund seeks capital appreciation and current income while managing net equity exposure by investing a portion of SunAmerica's assets in accordance with a strategy designed to reduce the effects of volatility.   Fixed Annuities   Changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. As a result of the current low interest rate environment, fixed annuity sales in the first six months of 2012 were significantly below 2011 levels. If the low interest rate environment continues, SunAmerica expects its fixed annuities sales (including deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) to continue to decline for the remainder of 2012.   Life Insurance   SunAmerica's strategic focus for mortality-based products includes disciplined underwriting, active expense management and product innovation. SunAmerica's distribution strategy is to grow new sales by strengthening the core retail independent and career agent distributor channels and expanding its market presence. In addition, SunAmerica is enhancing its service and technology platform through the consolidation of its life operations and administrative systems. These efforts are expected to result in an improved service delivery model and a more efficient operating platform over time.   Interest Crediting Rates   The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in SunAmerica products may have the effect, in a continued low interest rate environment, of reducing SunAmerica's spreads and thus reducing future profitability. SunAmerica partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset-liability management process, product design elements, and crediting rate strategies. A prolonged low interest rate environment may, nevertheless, negatively affect spreads on interest-sensitive business.   As of June 30, 2012, the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities consisted of intermediate- and long-term fixed maturity securities. SunAmerica generally purchases assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of maturities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. Opportunistic investments in structured securities continue to be made in order to improve yields, increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment.   SunAmerica's annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Therefore, on new business currently written, as well as on in-force business above minimum guarantees, SunAmerica has adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates in order to maintain targeted interest rate spreads.   New fixed annuity sales have declined in the first six months of 2012 relative to the same period in 2011, as consumers appeared reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively lower crediting rates offered. However, even in the current interest rate environment, SunAmerica continues to pursue new sales at targeted interest rate spreads. These annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted interest spreads.   As a result of these actions, SunAmerica estimates that if interest rates remain at or near current levels through the end of 2013, full year 2012 and 2013 pre-tax operating income will not be materially impacted. The effect would increase modestly in 2014.  94 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  As indicated in the table below, approximately 56 percent of SunAmerica's annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of June 30, 2012, an increase from 45 percent at December 31, 2011 due to continued spread management actions taken through crediting rate changes. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of June 30, 2012 ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products.  The following table presents account values by range of current minimum guaranteed interest rates and current crediting rates for SunAmerica's universal life and deferred fixed annuity products and fixed account options of variable annuity products:                                 Current Crediting Rates      June 30, 2012 Contractual Minimum Guaranteed Interest Rate Account Values (in millions)   At Contractual Minimum Guarantee   1 - 50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   More than 50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   Total            Universal life insurance                              1%   $ 12   $ -   $ 9   $ 21      > 1% - 2%     -     -     232     232      > 2% - 3%     92     198     1,538     1,828      > 3% - 4%     2,120     236     1,589     3,945      > 4% - 5%     4,415     81     198     4,694      > 5% - 5.5%     320     3     5     328            Subtotal   $ 6,959   $ 518   $ 3,571   $ 11,048            Fixed annuities                              1%   $ 569   $ 2,385   $ 6,366   $ 9,320      > 1% - 2%     3,435     8,149     11,752     23,336      > 2% - 3%     27,740     3,381     7,232     38,353      > 3% - 4%     12,557     1,931     573     15,061      > 4% - 5%     8,123     -     7     8,130      > 5% - 5.5%     243     -     5     248            Subtotal   $ 52,667   $ 15,846   $ 25,935   $ 94,448            Total   $ 59,626   $ 16,364   $ 29,506   $ 105,496            Percentage of total     56 %   16 %   28 %   100 %            In addition to the products discussed above, certain traditional long-duration products for which SunAmerica does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential losses in a prolonged low interest rate environment.        AIRCRAFT LEASING  On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any offering or that an offering will be completed.   Challenges in the global economy, including the European sovereign debt crisis, political uncertainty in the Middle East, and sustained higher fuel prices, have negatively impacted many airlines' profitability, cash flows and liquidity, and increased the probability that some airlines, including ILFC customers, will cease operations or file for bankruptcy. During the first six months of 2012, ILFC has had six lessees cease operations or file for bankruptcy (or its equivalent) and these lessees returned 45 aircraft to ILFC. As of July 24, 2012, 31 aircraft have been committed to new leases, 10 have been or are intended for part-out, one has been sold and three remain to be re-leased. Most of ILFC's lessees, like much of the international airline industry, are not publicly rated and are rated internally non-investment grade by AIG. Future events, including a prolonged recession, ongoing uncertainty  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 95      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, political unrest, continued weak consumer demand, high fuel prices, or restricted availability of credit to the aviation industry could lead to the weakening or cessation of operations of additional airlines, which in turn would adversely affect ILFC's earnings and cash flows.        OTHER OPERATIONS  Mortgage Guaranty   The following will continue to affect results in 2012:   •Market developments — UGC believes it is a market leader in the mortgage insurance industry with a differentiated risk-based pricing model producing new high quality business. The withdrawal of certain competitors from the market during 2011 combined with the differentiation strategy that UGC implemented in late 2010 and early 2011 has positioned UGC to take advantage of market opportunities. UGC is continuing to execute this strategy during 2012. In the first six months of 2012, UGC increased pricing nationally by approximately 3.5 percent and will continue to review its new business pricing relative to changes in the market to ensure that the price of coverage is commensurate with the level of risk being underwritten.  •Delinquent inventory review — Beginning in the third quarter of 2011 and continuing into the second quarter of 2012, UGC requested that lenders file claims, in accordance with the terms of the respective master policies, on approximately 20,000 accounts that had been delinquent approximately 24 months or more and were not expected to be cured. Many of these delinquencies were the result of the foreclosure moratorium discussed below. Through June 30, 2012, UGC received responses to approximately 88 percent of these requests. The claims arising from these requests have resulted in coverage rescissions and claim denials at levels higher than previously experienced. UGC has considered these higher levels of rescissions and denials and the potential for higher levels of overturns in estimating its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. Over the remainder of 2012, reserve development and premium refunds associated with these claim requests will continue to impact the business, especially in the third quarter of 2012 when UGC expects overturn activity related to these delinquencies to be at its highest. UGC continues to monitor and review the status of these requests and plans to contact lenders on an ongoing basis regarding additional delinquencies that meet these criteria. Under the terms of these master policies, if a claim is not submitted within a year of UGC's request, the lender would no longer be able to file a claim.  •Foreclosure delays — Since 2010, a variety of servicing practices have come to light that have delayed the foreclosure process in many states. Some of these practices, such as the "robo-signing" of affidavits in judicial foreclosures, have resulted in government investigations into lenders' foreclosure practices. These developments have slowed the reporting of foreclosures, which has in turn slowed the filing of mortgage insurance claims and increased the uncertainty surrounding the determination of the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses. UGC's assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend, although significant uncertainty remains surrounding the determination of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. UGC expects that this trend may continue for the remainder of 2012 and may negatively affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is uncertain and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution, individually or collectively, may have on its future results of operations or financial condition. As discussed above, UGC has requested that lenders file claims on delinquent loans before foreclosure proceedings have commenced in an effort to reduce the uncertainty surrounding these issues. UGC expects to continue this practice as long as significant delays in reporting foreclosures continue.    Global Capital Markets   The remaining AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed opportunistically, consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. The portfolio consists of interest rate, currency, commodity, and equity  96 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. derivatives primarily to hedge trades with AIG affiliates and to further AIG's risk management objectives. Additionally, AIGFP has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for maximum economic benefit and limited risk. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.   The overall hedging activity for AIG and its operating companies will be executed primarily by Global Capital Markets (GCM) through AIG Markets.   Direct Investment Book   MIP assets and liabilities and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP (collectively, the Direct Investment book or DIB) are currently managed collectively on a single program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent.   Program management is focused on winding down this portfolio over time, and reducing and managing its liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB. As part of this program management, AIG may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, AIG may seek to buy back debt or sell assets on an opportunistic basis, subject to market conditions.   As further discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG received substantial distributions from ML III subsequent to June 30, 2012. A portion of those proceeds were re-invested by the DIB in certain CDO securities sold in the auctions of ML III assets and AIG expects to receive approximately $1.9 billion in proceeds from auctions completed through July 31, 2012 by mid-August. The FRBNY has continued to auction the remaining ML III assets and any proceeds from further sales of ML III assets by the FRBNY will be allocated 67 percent to the FRBNY and 33 percent to AIG. Proceeds received by AIG from such sales may be reinvested in CDO securities sold by ML III.   Including the amounts to be received from completed auctions, the DIB will have more than $5 billion of liquidity in excess of the amount that AIG believes is necessary to meet all of the DIB maturing liabilities even in stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from AIG Parent.   Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB, including CDO securities purchased from ML III, are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.   Retained Interests   Retained Interests may continue to experience volatility due to fair value gains or losses on the AIA ordinary shares and the retained interests in ML III. At June 30, 2012, AIG owned approximately 19 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of AIA. A change of one Hong Kong dollar in AIA's share price would result in an approximate $300 million change in AIG's pre-tax income.   AIG is restricted from selling any of its remaining AIA ordinary shares to third parties or entering into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of its remaining interest in AIA until September 4, 2012. After that date, AIG expects to monetize its investment in AIA ordinary shares from time to time depending on market conditions, AIG's liquidity position and opportunities for cash redeployment.

Premiums and Policy Fees   Premiums decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 primarily due to declines in Commercial Insurance, resulting from enhanced risk selection and the continued execution of strategic initiatives to improve pricing and loss ratios. These were partially offset by increases in Consumer Insurance, resulting from the business mix shift towards higher value lines and continued investment in the direct marketing channel.   Policy fees decreased slightly in the three-and six month periods ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to lower variable annuity living benefit fees.

Net investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2012 was consistent with the same period in 2011. The fair value of AIG's ML III interest increased in the current period compared to the three months ended June 30, 2011. This increase was offset by a decrease in the fair value of AIA securities in the current period compared to an increase in the prior period.   Net investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 improved from the same period of 2011, primarily due to:   •increases in the fair value of Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), which made its final distribution in the first quarter of 2012, and fair value gains on AIG's ML III interest; and  •higher income from fixed maturity securities and short-term investments attributable to higher average invested balances in connection with the redeployment of cash in the second quarter of 2011.    The increases were partially offset by:   •declines in the fair value of AIA securities as a result of AIG's reduced ownership compared to the same period in the prior year; and  •declines in alternative investment income in 2012 due to lower equity market performance in 2012.   100 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

These gains were partially offset by the following:   •derivative losses driven primarily by lower U.S. Treasury rates and the U.S. dollar strengthening against most foreign currencies; and  •higher other-than-temporary impairments on equity investments, primarily Japanese insurance companies and partnerships.    AIG recognized net realized capital gains in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to net realized capital losses in the same period in 2011 due to the following:   •significantly higher gains on sales of fixed maturity securities, due in part to the capital loss tax carryforwards program discussed above, and equity securities, which included a $426 million gain on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P.;  •foreign exchange losses during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the Swiss franc; and  •lower impairments on life settlement contracts.    These gains were partially offset by the following:   •higher other-than-temporary impairments on RMBS;   •higher other-than-temporary impairment on partnership portfolios and equity securities in Japan; and  •derivative losses driven primarily by spread tightening and the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 101      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Aircraft Leasing Revenues and Expenses   Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to the impact of early returns of aircraft from bankrupt lessees and lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet and the limited delivery schedule of new aircraft over the past year, partially offset by an increase from the consolidation of AeroTurbine commencing in October 2011. In the second quarter of 2012, ILFC's average fleet size remained relatively stable compared to the corresponding period in 2011.   ILFC recorded impairment charges, and fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $75 million and $130 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $42 million and $155 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively. See Segment Results — Aircraft Leasing Operations — Aircraft Leasing Results for additional information.   Other Income and Expenses   The increase in Other income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 was driven by:   •improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads on assets and the widening of AIG's credit spreads on liabilities. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $321 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $16 million in the same period in 2011;   •improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price movements and amortization within the CDS portfolio. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, an unrealized market valuation gain of $57 million was recognized compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $94 million in the same period in 2011; and  •gains recognized upon unwinding certain transactions in the amount of $118 million.    The decrease in Other income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 was driven by:   •a decline in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected due to the adverse impact of tightening of AIG's credit spreads on liabilities carried at fair value. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $130 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $316 million in the same period of 2011;   •a decline in net credit valuation adjustments on the GCM derivative assets and liabilities due to a tightening of AIG's credit spreads relative to those of its counterparties. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $76 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $26 million in the same period of 2011; and  •a decline in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio primarily from CDS transactions written on Corporate debt/CLOs driven by price movements within the CDS portfolio. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, an unrealized market valuation gain of $197 million was recognized compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $229 million in the same period of 2011.    In addition, Other income decreased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, due to lower gains on real estate dispositions and equity losses on real estate investments.   Other expenses increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 due to an increase in estimated litigation liability during the second quarter of 2012 of approximately $719 million, partially offset by lower restructuring and pension expenses.  102 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred   Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 as a result of lower catastrophe losses for Chartis in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011 and the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and earthquakes in New Zealand in the first quarter of 2011. The results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 also include a provision of approximately $100 million in estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims in conjunction with the use of the Social Security Death Master File to identify potential claims not yet presented.   Other Acquisition and Insurance Expenses   Amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 primarily due to Chartis' continued strategy to grow the higher margin Consumer Insurance business, which carries higher acquisition costs than Commercial Insurance, and change its mix of business within Commercial and Consumer Insurance to more profitable lines with higher acquisition costs.   Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to increases in bad debt expense, direct marketing expense, compensation expense and expenses related to strategic initiatives for Chartis, and as a result of a decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities arising from the Fuji acquisition.   Interest Expense   Interest expense decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 primarily as a result of a net reduction in outstanding debt. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $72 million in 2011 through the date of termination, including amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of $48 million.   Loss on Extinguishment of Debt   The decline in loss on extinguishment of debt reflects the effect of the $3.3 billion charge for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility.   Income Taxes   Interim Tax Calculation Method   AIG uses the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to those items is treated discretely, and is reported in the same period as the related item. For the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, the tax effects of the gains on ML II and certain dispositions, including a portion of the ordinary shares of AIA and common units of The Blackstone Group L.P., as well as certain actual gains on SunAmerica's available-for-sale securities were treated as discrete items. Those changes in the valuation allowance, which were reflected in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 were also treated as discrete items.   Interim Tax Expense (Benefit)   For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, the effective tax rates on pretax income from continuing operations were (33.8) and 8.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, attributable to continuing operations differ from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and investments in partnerships,  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 103      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. adjustments to the tax bases of certain foreign aircraft leases and a decrease in the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.   For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, the effective tax rates on pretax income from continuing operations were (16.5) and (108.1) percent, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, attributable to continuing operations differed from the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations for the U.S. consolidated income tax group, tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, investments in partnerships, and changes in uncertain tax positions.   See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   Discontinued Operations   Results from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2011 include a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion on the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.        SEGMENT RESULTS  AIG presents and discusses its financial information using the following measures, which it believes are most meaningful to its financial statement users:   •Chartis —    •Operating income (loss). During the first quarter of 2012, AIG revised the non-GAAP measure for Chartis to operating income (loss), which includes both underwriting income and investment income, but not net realized capital gains (losses) or other income (expense);   •Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, which is the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments and the impact of discount;   •Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, which is the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of discount;   •SunAmerica — Operating income (loss). During the first quarter of 2012, AIG revised its definition of operating income (loss) to exclude changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, and changes in benefit reserves related to net realized capital gains (losses). In addition to the above items, SunAmerica also excludes net realized capital gains (losses) and the related DAC, VOBA and SIA amortization from Operating income (loss);  •Aircraft Leasing — Operating income (loss), which is pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses); and  •Mortgage Guaranty — Underwriting profit (loss), which is income (loss) before net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).    Results from discontinued operations are excluded from these measures.   AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income or unadjusted ratios are provided.  104 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Declines in certain lines of business that did not meet internal operating objectives within Commercial Insurance, particularly in the loss-sensitive Casualty book of business, were partially offset by an increase in Consumer Insurance net premiums written.  •The loss ratio decreased by 5.1 points and 13.1 points for the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, due to a reduction in catastrophe losses, coupled with the benefit from positive pricing trends and the execution of Chartis' strategic initiatives and an increase in reserve discount. Catastrophe losses, adjusted for reinstatement premiums, were $328 million and $408 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $539 million and $2.3 billion in the respective prior year periods. Net prior year adverse development including related premium adjustments was $137 million and $184 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to favorable development of $8 million and $20 million in the respective prior year periods.  •The expense ratio increased by 3.5 points and 4.3 points for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, as acquisition costs (primarily commissions) increased due to the change in business mix to higher value lines and increased market competition. Acquisition costs also increased due to lower ceding commissions on reinsured business as a result of Commercial Insurance restructuring its Property reinsurance program as part of Chartis' decision to retain more profitable business while continuing to manage aggregate exposures. General operating expenses increased in both periods as Chartis continued to invest in a number of strategic initiatives. In addition, Chartis incurred higher personnel costs, as it continued to attract, retain and develop its human capital and seeks to better align employee performance with Chartis and AIG strategic goals.   •Net investment income increased slightly in both periods due to the redeployment of excess cash, short-term investments, and the investment in longer-term and higher-yielding securities.  •Chartis paid dividends of $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion to AIG in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 105      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Chartis Operations   Chartis presents its financial information in two operating segments — Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, as well as a Chartis Other category.   Commercial Insurance distributes its products through a network of agencies, independent retail and wholesale brokers, and branches. These products are categorized into four major lines of business:   •Casualty: Includes general liability, commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management insurance. Casualty also includes risk management and other customized structured programs for large corporate customers and multinational companies.  •Property: Includes industrial and commercial property insurance products, which cover exposures to man-made and natural disasters, including business interruption.  •Specialty: Includes environmental, political risk, trade credit, surety, marine, and aerospace insurance, and various product offerings for small-medium enterprises.  •Financial: Includes various forms of professional liability insurance, including director and officer (D&O), fidelity, employment practices, fiduciary liability, network security, kidnap and ransom, and errors and omissions insurance that protect individual insureds and corporate entities.    Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Consumer product lines are distributed through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet. Consumer Insurance products are categorized into two major lines of business:   •Accident & Health: Includes individual and group voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accidental and supplemental health products, including accidental death and disability, accidental medical reimbursement, hospital indemnity and medical excess for individual, employees, associations and other organizations. It also includes life products as well as a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers, including trip cancellation, trip interruption, lost baggage, travel assistance and concierge services.  •Personal Lines: Includes automobile, homeowners and extended warranty insurance. It also includes insurance for high net worth individuals (offered through the Chartis Private Client Group) including umbrella, yacht and fine art, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection.    Chartis Other consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including Excess Workers' Compensation written on a stand-alone basis and Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and prior), certain Chartis expenses relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses.   The historical Chartis financial information has been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain products that were previously reported in the Commercial Insurance operating segment to the Consumer Insurance operating segment. This change aligns the financial reporting with the changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the business to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. These revisions did not impact the total Chartis reportable segment results previously reported.

General operating expenses increased due to the continued investment in strategic initiatives during 2012. In addition, Chartis incurred higher personnel costs, as it continued to attract, retain and develop its human capital and seeks to better align employee performance with Chartis and AIG strategic goals. Catastrophe losses adjusted for reinstatement premiums were $328 million and $408 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $539 million and $2.3 billion in the respective prior year periods. The three and six months ended June 30, 2012 also benefited from a $100 million increase in reserve discount. Net prior year adverse development including related premium adjustments was $137 million and $184 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to net prior year favorable development of $8 million and $20 million in the respective prior year periods. In 2012, net prior year adverse development was due to claims emergence in the Chartis Environmental business (policies written after 1987), the legacy environmental exposures (1986 and prior), and excess casualty lines, partially offset by favorable development from catastrophe-related reserves of $106 million and $254 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. In 2011, net prior year adverse development was due to the impact of claims emergence in non-catastrophic reserves, reduced by additional premiums, offset by favorable development from catastrophes of $11 million and $50 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively. The increase in the favorable development from catastrophe-related reserves is due primarily to the unique severity of 2011 catastrophes.   See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense for further discussion of discounting of reserves and prior year development.   Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results   Operating income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 decreased, reflecting an increase in acquisition expenses coupled with a decrease in the allocated net investment income, primarily due to a decrease in the risk free rate. Acquisition expenses increased as a result of a decrease in loss sensitive business as Chartis moves towards higher value lines, and increased market competition. This is partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and the impact of underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection. The current period benefited from a $100 million increase in reserve discount. In the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, catastrophe losses, adjusted for reinstatement premiums were $288 million compared to $470 million in the same period in 2011. Net prior year adverse development including related premium  108 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. adjustments was $123 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to favorable development of $43 million in the prior year period.   Operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 increased, reflecting lower catastrophe losses, the impact of underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection and an increase in reserve discount, partially offset by higher acquisition costs and a decrease in the allocated net investment income due to a decrease in the risk free rate. The current period benefited from a $100 million increase in reserve discount. Catastrophe losses, adjusted for reinstatement premiums, in 2012 were $364 million compared to $1.7 billion in 2011 as the prior year included the impact of the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and the earthquakes in New Zealand. Acquisition costs increased primarily as a result of higher commission expense due to a decrease in loss sensitive business as Chartis moves towards higher value lines. In 2012, net prior year adverse development was $171 million compared to net prior year favorable development of $60 million in the prior year.   Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results   Operating income in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 increased primarily due to the combination of lower catastrophe losses, the effect of rate increases and underwriting improvements related to enhanced risk selection and portfolio management, and higher allocated net investment income, which were partially offset by higher acquisition costs. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, expenses increased primarily as a result of a change in the mix of business to higher value lines with higher acquisition costs, increased investment in direct marketing, and a decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities recognized at the time of the Fuji acquisition. Catastrophe losses for the three- and six-month periods ended 2012 were $40 million and $44 million, respectively, compared to $69 million and $558 million during the same period in the prior year. Net prior year favorable development was $36 million and $50 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to net prior year adverse development of $28 million in each of the respective prior year periods.   Chartis Net Premiums Written   Net premiums written are the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as a component of unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheet.

The decrease in net premiums written in each period was primarily due to enhanced risk selection, particularly in the Casualty line of business. This is consistent with Chartis' business strategy to improve pricing and loss ratios and to not renew business that does not meet Chartis' internal performance or operating targets. Retentions are in line with management's expectations based on the execution of these strategic initiatives.   Casualty net premiums written decreased in both periods primarily due to the continuation of Chartis' strategic initiatives related to improved risk selection and rate increases. The continuation of the restructuring of the loss sensitive book of business in the Americas resulted in a reduction of net premiums written of $75 million and $222 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. Further, management continued to emphasize higher value lines, while taking corrective action in lines and accounts that do not meet internal performance targets, including U.S. workers' compensation and European primary casualty.   Property net premiums written increased in both periods due to a restructuring of a reinsurance program as part of Chartis' decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure. Catastrophe exposed business retained in the Americas and Asia Pacific region also benefitted from rate increases.   Specialty net premiums written for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 decreased due to the continuation of Chartis' strategic initiatives related to improved risk selection, particularly within products provided to small and medium enterprises, which was partially offset by the restructuring of a reinsurance program. Specialty net premiums written for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 increased slightly as Chartis continues to shift its business mix towards higher value lines, particularly in aerospace and trade credit.   Financial lines net premiums written for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 increased primarily due to growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas. Financial lines net premiums written for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 decreased as 2011 benefited from a multi-year Errors and Omissions policy in the Americas that produced net premiums written of $148 million.       Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written    The Consumer Insurance business continued to grow its net premiums written and build momentum through its multiple distribution channels and focus on the growth economy nations. Consumer Insurance is well-diversified  110 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. across the major lines of business and has global strategies that are executed across its regions to enhance customer relationships and business performance.   Consumer Insurance currently has direct marketing operations in over 50 countries, and management continued to emphasize the growth of this channel, which accounts for 15 percent of its overall net premiums written. Total global direct marketing spending outside the Americas region has increased by approximately 20 percent in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, from the same periods in 2011.   A&H net premiums written increased in both periods due to the implementation of the strategic partnership with American General, strong growth of new business sales in Fuji Life, direct marketing programs in Japan and other Asia Pacific nations and growth in individual personal travel. This was partially offset by the continuing strategies to reposition U.S. direct marketing, as well as pricing and underwriting actions in Europe.   Personal lines net premiums written increased in both periods primarily due to the execution of Chartis' strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business such as personal property. Auto net premiums written grew slightly while its proportion of the portfolio declined due to management focus on diversifying the global base.       Chartis Other Net Premiums Written    Substantially all premiums reported in Chartis Other relate to Excess Workers' Compensation, written on a stand-alone basis. During 2011, as part of its ongoing initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines, Chartis determined to cease writing Excess Workers' Compensation business on a stand-alone basis. This line of business is subject to premium audits (upon the expiration of the underlying policy) and as a result, Chartis Other will reflect the effects of premium audit activity through subsequent years.  The following table presents Chartis' net premiums written by region:                                              Three Months Ended June 30,            Six Months Ended June 30,                  Percentage Change in U.S. dollars   Percentage Change in Original Currency   Percentage Change in U.S. dollars   Percentage Change in Original Currency     (in millions)   2012   2011   2012   2011            Commercial Insurance:                                                      Americas    $ 3,962    $ 4,238      (7 )%    (7 )%  $ 7,045    $ 7,659      (8 )%    (8 )%    Asia Pacific      538      460      17      17      989      899      10      8      EMEA      1,064      1,025      4      8      2,753      2,889      (5 )    (2 )          Total net premiums written    $ 5,564    $ 5,723      (3 )%    (2 )%  $ 10,787    $ 11,447      (6 )%    (5 )%          Consumer Insurance:                                                      Americas    $ 948    $ 916      3 %    4 %  $ 1,972    $ 1,827      8 %    9 %    Asia Pacific      2,154      2,032      6      6      4,175      3,949      6      3      EMEA      426      491      (13 )    (7 )    978      1,080      (9 )    (6 )          Total net premiums written    $ 3,528    $ 3,439      3 %    3 %  $ 7,125    $ 6,856      4 %    3 %          Chartis Other:                                                      Americas    $ 1    $ 5      (80 )%    (80 )%  $ 1    $ 30      (97 )%    (97 )%    Asia Pacific      2      -      NM      NM      2      -      NM      NM            Total net premiums written    $ 3    $ 5      (40 )%    (40 )%  $ 3    $ 30      (90 )%    (90 )%          Total Chartis:                                                      Americas    $ 4,911    $ 5,159      (5 )%    (5 )%  $ 9,018    $ 9,516      (5 )%    (5 )%    Asia Pacific      2,694      2,492      8      8      5,166      4,848      7      4      EMEA      1,490      1,516      (2 )    3      3,731      3,969      (6 )    (3 )          Total net premiums written    $ 9,095    $ 9,167      (1 )%    NM %  $ 17,915    $ 18,333      (2 )%    (2 )%            AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies.

This was partially offset by continued growth in Consumer Insurance, which was primarily attributable to increases in the U.S. personal accident business, the strategic group benefits partnership with American General, and all personal property lines.   Asia Pacific net premiums written increased in both periods due to growth in Consumer Insurance, which was primarily driven by A&H, personal property, direct marketing and travel written in Japan. The expansion in Asia Pacific countries outside Japan also continued, supported by growth in direct marketing, individual personal accident insurance in China and nearly all Personal Lines products.   EMEA net premiums written decreased in both periods primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the British pound and euro. Excluding foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 mainly due to a reduction of reinsurance protection in the Property and Specialty lines of Commercial Insurance. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, the EMEA net premiums written decreased due to the execution of underwriting discipline, a reduction in primary casualty as it did not meet internal performance targets, and rate strengthening initiatives on new and renewal business for Commercial Insurance. Consumer Insurance is focused on re-building its direct marketing programs that it previously shared with American Life Insurance Company (ALICO).   Chartis Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents the Chartis combined ratios based on GAAP data and a reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:                                       Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,              Increase (Decrease)   Increase (Decrease)         2012   2011   2012   2011            Commercial Insurance                                          Loss ratio      73.8      80.1      (6.3 )    74.0      89.0      (15.0 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (5.3 )    (8.3 )    3.0      (3.5 )    (15.5 )    12.0      Prior year development net of premium adjustments      (2.2 )    0.3      (2.5 )    (1.5 )    0.2      (1.7 )    Change in discount      1.9      -      1.9      0.9      -      0.9            Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted      68.2      72.1      (3.9 )    69.9      73.7      (3.8 )          Expense ratio      28.5      23.3      5.2      28.9      23.4      5.5            Combined ratio      102.3      103.4      (1.1 )    102.9      112.4      (9.5 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (5.3 )    (8.3 )    3.0      (3.5 )    (15.5 )    12.0      Prior year development net of premium adjustments      (2.2 )    0.3      (2.5 )    (1.5 )    0.2      (1.7 )    Change in discount      1.9      -      1.9      0.9      -      0.9            Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted      96.7      95.4      1.3      98.8      97.1      1.7             112 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Therefore, underwriting ratios are not presented for Chartis Other.       Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Loss Ratios    The loss ratio decreased in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in catastrophe losses incurred and an increase in reserve discount of $100 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012. The improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 reflects the continued execution of Chartis' strategic initiatives, including enhanced risk selection, particularly in the Property business. Net prior year adverse development including related premium adjustments was $123 million and $171 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to net prior year favorable development of $43 million and $60 million in the respective prior year periods. See Chartis Quarterly and Year-to-Date Loss Ratios below for further information on prior year development.       Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Loss Ratios    The Consumer Insurance loss ratio in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 decreased compared to the same periods in 2011 mainly due to lower catastrophes as the prior year period was impacted by the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and other events. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three-month  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. period ended June 30, 2012 was unchanged from the same prior year period as an unfavorable quarter in Japan reflecting higher average severity in the auto and A&H businesses was offset by solid results in the rest of the world. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 decreased despite having an unfavorable quarter in Japan. Management continued to focus on improving price sophistication and the loss performance of the portfolio by taking underwriting actions, where necessary, to meet internal performance or operating targets.       Chartis Quarterly and Year-to-Date Loss Ratios    The decrease in the loss ratio in both periods reflects a decrease in catastrophe losses coupled with the benefit from positive pricing trends and the execution of Chartis' strategic initiatives, including business mix changes and risk selection. The loss ratio in the prior year was primarily impacted by the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and the earthquakes in New Zealand.   In 2012, net prior year adverse development was due to claims emergence in the Chartis Environmental business (policies written after 1987), the legacy environmental exposures (1986 and prior), and excess casualty lines, partially offset by favorable development from catastrophe-related reserves of $106 million and $254 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. In 2011, net prior year adverse development was due to the impact of claims emergence in non-catastrophic reserves, reduced by additional premiums, offset by favorable development from catastrophes of $11 million and $50 million in the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively. The increase in the favorable development from catastrophe-related reserves is due primarily to the unique severity of 2011 catastrophes.   See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense for further discussion of discounting of reserves and prior year development.

All other events include events that are considered catastrophic but which remain below the $20 million itemization threshold.       Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Expense Ratios    The expense ratio increased by 5.2 points and 5.5 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs related to Chartis' strategy of growing higher value lines, which typically incur higher commission rates. In addition, ceding commissions decreased as a result of a restructuring of the Property reinsurance program as part of Chartis' decision to retain more profitable business while continuing to manage aggregate exposures. The increase in acquisition costs contributed approximately 3.1 points and 3.2 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. Further, increases in bad debt expense of approximately $119 million contributed approximately 1.1 points to the expense ratio in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012. The remainder of the expense ratio increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs.       Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Expense Ratios    The expense ratio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 decreased by 0.4 points compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a change in business mix. The expense ratio in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 increased by 1.2 points primarily due to increases in operating expenses incurred to grow key lines of business across a number of geographic areas and a $58 million decrease in VOBA benefit compared to the same period in the prior year.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 115      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Chartis Quarterly and Year-to-Date Expense Ratios    Chartis also continued to invest in a number of strategic initiatives during 2012, including the implementation of global finance and information systems, preparation for Solvency II compliance, readiness for potential regulation by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act, legal entity restructuring, and underwriting and claims initiatives that are reported as part of Chartis Other. For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, such investments totaled $60 million and $109 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $27 million and $64 million over the same periods in the prior year. Chartis incurred higher personnel costs, as it continued efforts to attract, retain and develop its human capital and to better align employee performance with Chartis and AIG strategic goals. These items combined contributed approximately 1.5 points to the expense ratio increase in each respective period.

Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as Chartis Other. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial and Consumer Insurance operating segments.   Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to Chartis Other.   Net realized capital gains (losses) and Other income (expense) — net are not allocated to Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, but are reported as part of Chartis Other.       Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Investment Income    Net investment income increased in both periods due to higher interest income on fixed maturity securities driven by the redeployment of excess cash and short-term investments into longer term investments. Additionally, 2012 investment income increased due to the strategic partnership with American General, all of which is reported in Consumer Insurance. This was offset by decreases in hedge fund returns, reflective of the overall lower market performance for the respective periods and decreases in dividend income primarily due to a reduction in investments in common stock in Japan, as a result of de-risking the portfolio. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, mutual fund income decreased as a result of Chartis selling a significant portion of its mutual fund holdings during the second half of 2011.  116 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)    Net realized capital gains for the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities in the amount of $165 million. This was partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment of $96 million, primarily attributable to publicly traded and privately-held equity securities in the Japan portfolios and a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities. In addition, impairment charges of $56 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period.   Net realized capital losses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 were primarily driven by other-than-temporary impairments of $299 million, primarily attributable to a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities, and partnership investments and equity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. In addition, impairment charges of $114 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period. These items were partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity securities in the amount of $329 million for the period.   Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense   The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for Chartis as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in AIG's Other operations category.

AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.

The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance, less applicable discount for future investment income.  The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit:                        (in millions)   June 30, 2012   December 31, 2011            Chartis:                  Commercial Insurance    $ 56,422    $ 58,549      Consumer Insurance      5,506      5,438      Other      4,180      3,992            Total Chartis      66,108      67,979            Other operations – Mortgage Guaranty      2,257      2,846            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 68,365    $ 70,825                    Discounting of Reserves    At June 30, 2012, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.2 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 - 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Beginning in 2011, a portion of these discounted reserves were ceded to a new Pennsylvania domiciled AIG subsidiary. However, this had no impact on the calculation of the overall discount. Certain other asbestos business that was written by Chartis is discounted based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business. The discount consists of the following: $777 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in the U.S. operations of Chartis and $2.4 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in the U.S. operations of Chartis; and $41 million — non-tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.   Changes in loss reserve discount are recorded in claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred. The change in discount for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 was a $94 million benefit and $74 million benefit, respectively, compared to an $8 million charge and $43 million charge in the same prior year periods. Accretion of discount of $91 million and $183 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, was offset by new discount of $85 million and $170 million, respectively, associated with current accident year workers' compensation reserves. Accretion of discount of $89 million and $178 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively, was offset by new discount of $81 million and $162 million, respectively, associated with 2011 accident year workers' compensation reserves. The benefit from the change in discount in the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 includes a $100 million increase in the reserve discount due to the commutation of an internal reinsurance treaty, under which a U.S. subsidiary previously ceded workers' compensation claims to a non-U.S. subsidiary. AIG discounts its loss reserves related to workers' compensation business written by its U.S. domiciled subsidiaries as permitted by the domiciliary statutory regulatory authorities. As a result of the commutation, the reserves for these claims are now being discounted commencing in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012. The commutation is an integral part of Chartis' efforts to simplify its internal reinsurance arrangements.   The prior year development and changes in the estimates in the payout patterns of previously established loss reserves did not have a significant impact on the change in discount in any of the periods presented.  118 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Quarterly Reserving Process    AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of June 30, 2012. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of June 30, 2012. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.   In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. AIG conducted reserve analyses in 2012 to determine the loss development from prior accident years. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, changes in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services), underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling practices.

Quarterly and Year-to-Date Prior Accident Year Development   As noted in the prior accident year development by major class of business table above, Chartis experienced adverse development in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to reserve increases on claims in the Chartis Environmental business (1987 and subsequent), legacy environmental exposures (1986 and prior), and excess casualty lines. This was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves for natural catastrophes (principally the Tohoku Catastrophe) and favorable development in the Consumer Insurance operating segment, which is included in All other, net.   The development in the Chartis Environmental business was primarily attributable to claims increases in four major categories:   •Site liability coverage for known remediation projects and ensuing increased clean-up costs;   •Fixed facility coverage for manufacturers and distributors whose raw materials, products or industrial processes present a significant environmental exposure;  •Policies that provide an enhanced general liability product designed specifically to meet the needs of environmental consultants and contractors; and •A Surety policy that provided performance bonding for the remediation and closure of a landfill site.    The claims increase in the Chartis Environmental line was the result of an on-going review of certain cases that AIG believes to be subject to the most volatility. For several of those cases, AIG concluded that the reserves should be increased to take into account the updated assessment of the claims. AIG also reviewed the legacy environmental (1986 and prior) claims and increased the reserves for certain of those claims.   Adding to the unfavorable development in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, were returned premiums on loss-sensitive business of $20 million and $14 million, respectively.   See Chartis Results herein and Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.       Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and Prior) Reserves    The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.   As described more fully in the 2011 Annual Report, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis performed annually. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount is reflected in the table below. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, AIG increased its gross environmental reserves by $150 million and increased its net environmental reserves by $74 million. This development is primarily attributable to several large accounts which led to an increase in the estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported.   In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, Chartis also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $212 million gross and $149 million net reserves as of June 30, 2012. Similar amounts were held at December 31, 2011.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 121      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

All of these accounts were fully reserved at the account level and included adequate reserves for those underlying individual claims that contributed to the actual losses. These individual claim closings, therefore, had no impact on Chartis' environmental reserves. (b)Represents an administrative change to the method of determining the number of open claims, which had no effect on carried reserves.   Survival Ratios – Asbestos and Environmental   The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at June 30, 2012 and 2011. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments.   Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analyses. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.  The following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                 2012    2011      Six Months Ended June 30,   Gross   Net*   Gross   Net*            Survival ratios:                              Asbestos      9.1      9.3      8.9      9.9      Environmental      5.0      4.7      2.9      2.7      Combined      8.7      8.7      8.3      8.7               * Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis on historical reserve excluding the effects of the NICO reinsurance transaction.   SunAmerica Highlights   The results of SunAmerica for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, reflected the following:   •Higher net investment income due to an increase in base yields from the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments in 2011. Offsetting higher base yields were lower income from private equity and hedge funds and lower call and tender income.  •The liquidation and distribution of the ML II investment in March 2012 increased investment income by $176 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 123                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.    •Prudent spread management, through crediting rate changes, resulted in improvements in base net investment spreads for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2012.  •Higher net realized capital gains from the sale of investments were reflected in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012. The sales of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition charges in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012.

Quarterly SunAmerica Results    The increase in net investment income reflected an increase in base yields of 9 basis points, due to the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011. Together with continued active crediting rate management, this resulted in higher base spreads across all of SunAmerica's spread-based annuity businesses in 2012. In addition to the increase from reinvestment, net investment income compared to the same quarter of 2011 reflected the following items:   •a $176 million fair value loss on ML II in the three months ended June 30, 2011. In March 2012, SunAmerica received a distribution of $1.6 billion from the sale by the FRBNY of the securities held by ML II, which resulted in the full liquidation by the FRBNY of this investment;   •$139 million decrease in income from private equity funds and hedge funds; and •$76 million decrease in call and tender income.    In the three months ended June 30, 2011, SunAmerica recorded an increase of approximately $100 million in the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims in conjunction with the use of the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) to identify potential claims not yet presented to the Company. Other than for the payment of claims, no significant adjustments to these reserves were recorded in 2012.   In a weak equity market, SunAmerica increases policyholder benefit reserves to recognize the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance for certain guaranteed benefits features of variable annuities. DAC related to these products may also be adjusted through amortization expense to reflect updates of future estimated gross profits due to changes in equity market assumptions. The effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets on the estimated gross profits of variable products is mitigated in part through the use of a reversion to mean methodology for estimating future gross profits. Under this methodology, SunAmerica assumes a long-term growth rate for the assets backing these liabilities, which factors in potential short-term fluctuations in the financial markets, and if the long-term growth rate assumption is deemed to be unreasonable in light of the current market conditions, the long-term growth rate assumption is revised upward or downward to reflect the revised estimate. SunAmerica did not make any changes to its long-term growth rate assumptions in 2011 or 2012. The effect of market underperformance was approximately $15 million higher DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses in 2012 compared to 2011.   SunAmerica has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded policy derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts, caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. SunAmerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a significant portion of the interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, SunAmerica began purchasing U.S. Treasury notes as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce this interest rate exposure. SunAmerica has elected to account for these securities at fair value. As a result of decreases in interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities during the three months ended June 30, 2012, the fair value of these securities, net of financing costs, increased by $70 million, which partially offset $226 million of embedded derivative losses included as a component of net realized capital gains (losses).   Pre-tax income for SunAmerica in the second quarter of 2012 included $326 million in net realized capital gains compared to $91 million of net realized capital gains in the same period of 2011. Higher gains from the sale of investments were partially offset by higher fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives due to declines in long-term interest rates.   The sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition of $461 million in the three months ended June 30 2012, which was reported as a component of Change in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital losses. These sales effectively transferred shadow loss recognition to actual loss recognition in the three months ended June 30, 2012. As part of a program to utilize capital loss tax  126 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. carryforwards, additional sales of such securities that would result in capital gains are planned during the remainder of 2012.       Year-to-Date SunAmerica Results    Net investment income increased for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 reflecting an increase in base yields of 28 basis points, due to the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011. In addition to the increase from reinvestment, net investment income compared to the same period of 2011 reflected the following items.    •$171 million fair value loss on ML II in 2011;  •$270 million decrease in income from private equity funds and hedge funds; and •$99 million decrease in call and tender income.    The six months ended June 30, 2011, included the previously described approximately $100 million in the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims.   The effect of positive equity market performance resulted in approximately $37 million lower DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011.   As a result of decreases in interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities during the first six months of 2012, the fair value of the aforementioned U.S. Treasury securities used for hedging, net of financing costs, increased by $51 million.   Pre-tax income for SunAmerica included a $11 million increase in net realized capital losses, due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and higher fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives due to declining credit spreads and declines in long-term interest rates, offset by higher gains from the sale of investments.   The sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition of $548 million in 2012, which had previously been reflected in shareholders' equity as reserves related to unrealized appreciation at December 31, 2011.

Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing customers.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 127      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Total premiums, deposits and other considerations decreased in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 as substantial decreases in individual fixed annuities were only partially offset by significant increases in individual variable annuities, and retail mutual funds which showed significant increases.   Individual fixed annuity deposits declined due to the low interest rate environment as consumers are more reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively lower crediting rates currently offered. Group retirement product deposits (which include deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) increased modestly due to higher levels of individual rollover deposits in 2012. SunAmerica expects that the low interest rate environment will begin to impact group retirement deposits, resulting in lower levels of deposits into fixed options over the remainder of 2012. Individual variable annuity deposits increased due to innovative product enhancements, expanded distribution as well as a more favorable competitive environment. Deposits from life insurance products increased in 2012 but were more than offset by declines in deferred annuities sold through life insurance distribution channels. Retail mutual fund annual sales growth was driven by SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.'s Focused Dividend Strategy product offering which continues as a top short and long term performer within its respective peer group.   SunAmerica's total life sales continued to show steady growth, increasing 11 percent during the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Term life sales have increased in both the independent and direct-to-consumer channels. SunAmerica's term life sales through its affiliated Matrix Direct channel in the first six months of 2012 were up more than 40 percent compared to the same period in 2011, due in part to the shift toward selling proprietary products. Private placement variable universal life sales have been strong in the first six months of 2012. Universal life sales were flat, as the economic environment continues to put pressure on the sales of these products, which typically have higher annual premiums than term products and also offer additional features.       Premiums    Premiums represent premiums received on traditional life insurance policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities.

Overall net flows declined in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to lower fixed annuity deposits resulting from the low interest rate environment, but remained positive. However, surrender rates for individual fixed annuities also decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 due to the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. Net flows improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 for individual variable annuities and group retirement products due to both the increase in deposits and favorable surrender experience. Net flows improved in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 for retail mutual funds due to increased deposits.

See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (b)Net of benefit of DAC and VOBA related to net realized capital losses.   As SunAmerica operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. See Note 2(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report for additional information on DAC and VOBA recoverability.   Aircraft Leasing Operations   AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines, and (since the date of its acquisition by ILFC) AeroTurbine. Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.  130 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

These items were offset by lower losses on extinguishment of debt.       Year-to-Date Aircraft Leasing Results    Aircraft Leasing pre-tax income remained constant due to:   •lower lease revenue due to early returns of aircraft by bankrupt lessees and lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet; and  •an increase in depreciation expense due to the change in depreciable lives and residual values of certain aircraft.

Other Operations   AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations, Global Capital Markets operations, Direct Investment book (DIB), Retained Interests and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).   AIG's Other operations include the following:   •Mortgage Guaranty — UGC subsidiaries issue residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one-to four-family residences.   •Global Capital Markets — consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties. The remaining AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed opportunistically, consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.  •Direct Investment book — includes results for the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.  •Retained Interests — includes fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA ordinary shares, the retained interest in ML III, and, prior to their sale on March 8, 2011, the MetLife, Inc.

Quarterly Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to:   •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $57 million, primarily in first-lien business, reflecting lower levels of newly reported delinquencies, increased denied and rescinded claims and favorable prior year loss development of $45 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012. Favorable development arising from the claims requests sent to lenders mentioned above was $41 million for the same period. This favorable development was more than offset by newly reported delinquencies on the 2008 and prior business; and  •an increase in realized investment gains of $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012.    Partially offset by:   •a decline in first lien earned premiums reflecting premium refunds of $10 million due to the rescissions arising from the claims requests sent to lenders during the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing into the first six months of 2012, as discussed in Outlook herein, in addition to the declining persistency on the 2008 and prior policy years;  •a decline in earned premiums on second-lien and international businesses, both of which were placed into runoff during 2008, of $10 million and $6 million respectively; and  •a $7 million increase in underwriting expenses driven primarily by an increase in underwriting, sales and product initiatives. All of these activities support the increase in new insurance written for the quarter.    Year-to-Date Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax results improved in the six month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to:   •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $105 million, primarily in first-lien business, reflecting lower levels of newly reported delinquencies, increased denied and rescinded claims and favorable loss development of $59 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Favorable development arising from the claims requests sent to lenders mentioned above was $77 million. This favorable development was more than offset by newly reported delinquencies on the 2008 and prior business; and  •an increase in realized capital gains of $17 million in the six month period ending June 30, 2012.    Partially offset by:   •a decline in first lien earned premiums of $33 million reflecting higher premium refunds due to the rescissions arising from the claims requests sent to lenders during the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing into the first six months of 2012, as discussed in Outlook herein, in addition to the declining persistency on the 2008 and prior policy years;  •a decline in earned premiums on second-lien, and international businesses, both of which were placed into runoff during 2008, of $20 million and $14 million respectively; and  •a $17 million increase in underwriting expenses driven primarily by an increase in underwriting, sales and product initiatives. All of these activities support the increase in new insurance written for the year.    New insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, was approximately $15 billion and $6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in new insurance written is the result of the market acceptance by lenders of UGC's risk-based pricing model and withdrawal of certain competitors from the market during 2011.

Global Capital Markets (GCM) Operations    Quarterly Global Capital Markets Results   GCM's pre-tax loss decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio and a decrease in operating expenses partially offset by an decline in net credit valuation adjustments on the GCM derivative assets and liabilities. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, an unrealized market valuation gain of $57 million was recognized compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $94 million in 2011. The improvement resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price movements and amortization within the CDS portfolio. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $54 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $2 million in 2011 due to a widening of counterparty credit spreads.   Year-to-Date Global Capital Markets Results   GCM's pre-tax income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to a decline in net credit valuation adjustments on the GCM derivative assets and liabilities and a decline in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $76 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $26 million in 2011 due to a tightening of AIG's credit spreads relative to those of its counterparties. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, an unrealized market valuation gain of $197 million was recognized compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $229 million in 2011. The decline in gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on Corporate debt/CLOs driven by price movements within the CDS portfolio.   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities herein for a discussion of the super senior CDS portfolio.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 135                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.       Direct Investment Book Results    Quarterly Direct Investment Book Results   The DIB's pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected and $118 million of gains realized from unwinding certain transactions, partially offset by losses in the MIP driven by negative spread income. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $321 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $16 million in 2011 due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads on assets and the widening of AIG's credit spreads on liabilities.   Year-to-Date Direct Investment Book Results   The DIB's pre-tax income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to realized capital gains in 2012 partially offset by a decline in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. In the first quarter of 2012, the DIB realized a capital gain of $426 million on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P. In addition, the DIB recognized gains of $122 million from unwinding certain transactions. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $130 million was recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $316 million in 2011 due to the adverse impact of tightening of AIG's credit spreads.

AIG's percentage of AIA ordinary shares decreased from approximately 33 percent to approximately 19 percent as a result of this sale. The fair value of AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities decreased $493 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2012 and increased $0.7 billion for six-month period ended June 30, 2012.   Change in Fair Value of ML III   The gains attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for 2012 were based in part on sales of ML III assets by the FRBNY.   Change in Fair Value of the MetLife Securities Prior to Sale   AIG recognized a loss in 2011, representing the decline in the securities' value, due to market conditions, from December 31, 2010 through the date of their sale in the first quarter of 2011.       Corporate & Other    Corporate & Other reported a higher pre-tax loss in the three months ended June 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to an increased estimated litigation liability of approximately $719 million during the second quarter of 2012 based on developments in several actions and higher net realized capital losses resulting from derivative losses driven by spread tightening and the U.S. dollar strengthening against most foreign currencies. These items were partially offset by foreign exchange gains on third party debt during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the British pound.   Corporate & Other reported a decline in pre-tax losses in the six months ended June 30, 2012 primarily due to the following:   •a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in 2011 in connection with the transactions to recapitalize AIG, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility;   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 137      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the exchange of outstanding junior subordinated debentures for senior unsecured notes in 2011; and  •foreign exchange losses on third party debt during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the British pound, and losses from SPV related derivatives in 2011.    Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in corporate expenses due to an increased estimated litigation liability of approximately $719 million during the second quarter of 2012 based on developments in several actions, ongoing corporate initiatives, higher compensation expense which varies in part based on AIG's stock price, lower gains on real estate dispositions and equity losses on real estate investments.

U.S. Treasury rates increased during the first quarter of 2012, however spreads narrowed more than the increase in U.S. Treasuries, resulting in lower rates and increased unrealized appreciation in the quarter. U.S. Treasury rates declined during the second quarter of 2012, with the ten year rate declining to a historical low during the quarter. Partially offsetting the U.S. Treasury rate decline were widening spreads, although the increased spreads were less than the U.S. Treasury rate decline.   During 2011 the insurance operations portfolios experienced appreciation in bonds available for sale, increased valuations on cost method partnerships, and appreciation on equities available for sale. The bond appreciation was driven by lower rates, with spread tightening on high yield securities more than offsetting the U.S. Treasury rate increase during the first quarter of 2011. Higher valuations on cost method partnerships also contributed to the  138 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. appreciation during the first quarter of 2011, driven by positive equity market performance. A combination of lower U.S. Treasury rates and spread tightening on investment grade securities drove appreciation during second quarter of 2011, with an additional contribution coming from appreciation in AIG's investment in the PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd.   The effects of reclassification adjustments included in net income on unrealized appreciation of investments were $865 million and $1,787 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $661 million and $897 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2011.   See Investments — Investment Highlights — Securities available for sale herein for a table on the gross unrealized gains (losses) of AIG's available for sale securities by type of security.   Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other   DAC for investment-oriented products adjusted for changes in estimated gross profits that result from changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale. Because fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to DAC equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in these adjustments, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The change in deferred acquisition costs in 2012 is primarily the result of increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest-sensitive products.   Change in Future Policy Benefits   Primarily as a result of the significant decline in interest rates during the three month period ended June 30, 2012, AIG recorded additional future policy benefits through other comprehensive income. This change in future policy benefits assume the securities underlying certain traditional long-duration products had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and reinvested at current yields. This increase in future policy benefits was partially offset by loss reserve recognition resulting from sales of securities in unrealized gain positions.   Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments   Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2012 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, British pound and euro and as a result of the closing of the Nan Shan sale in the third quarter of 2011.   Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2012 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and euro and as a result of the sale of Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. in the third quarter of 2011.   Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities   The decline primarily reflects the gradual run-off of the cash flow hedge portfolio, partially offset by a decline in the interest rate environment.   Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment   The change is due to the fluctuation in exchange rates in effect for 2012 compared to 2011, a one-time adjustment made for divested business units in 2011 and the amortization of a larger net actuarial loss balance that existed at year-end 2011. The larger net actuarial loss balance at year-end 2011 was the result of lower discount rates used to value the U.S. plans at year-end 2011 compared to year-end 2010.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Divestitures and Deconsolidations   The change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations in 2011 primarily reflects the derecognition of all items in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of sale for AIG Star and AIG Edison.   Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, the effective tax rates on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Income were 33.5 percent and 31.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance and the effects of foreign operations.   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the effective tax rates on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Income were (3.2) percent and (66.3) percent, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance, the AIG Star and AIG Edison dispositions, changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries and the effects of foreign operations.        CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY       OVERVIEW  AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are short-term investments and borrowing availability under syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities. In addition, subject to market conditions, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs, which include the payment of maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries.   Highlights of actions taken during the six months ended June 30, 2012 that affected capital resources and liquidity include:   •AIG Share Repurchases — Purchases of AIG Common Stock totaling approximately $5.0 billion in the Equity Offerings;  •Pay down of AIA SPV Preferred Interests — $8.6 billion in liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury (representing the full amount outstanding) was paid down using both existing funds and the proceeds from the following sources:     •Sale of 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion;   •Distributions of approximately $1.6 billion to AIG from the FRBNY's final disposition of ML II securities; and   •Use of existing funds allocated to the MIP.   •Funding from Subsidiaries — approximately $4.6 billion paid to AIG Parent from subsidiaries, including:     •Approximately $1.0 billion and $561 million in non-cash and cash dividends from Chartis, respectively;   •$2.4 billion in note repayments from SunAmerica funded by payments of dividends from their subsidiaries; and   •$400 million in dividends from the AIA SPV, representing the proceeds from the sale of shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV to a Chartis subsidiary.   •AIG Senior Notes Offerings:   •A registered public offering of $750 million principal amount of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.800% Notes Due 2017 for the MIP in the first quarter of 2012. The proceeds were used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP; and    140 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.    •Two registered public offerings of an aggregate $1.5 billion principal amount of 4.875% Notes Due 2022 in the second quarter of 2012. The proceeds from these two offerings are being used for general corporate purposes, which are currently expected to include the repayment of debt maturing in 2013.      •Debt Reduction — repayment of total debt of $8.4 billion, which includes repayments of $3.0 billion by AIG Parent.  •ILFC Debt Financings — $3.2 billion in the aggregate of secured and unsecured financings, consisting of the issuance of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and $1.7 billion in secured term loans.    See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Sources of Liquidity herein for further discussion.        LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY MANAGEMENT  AIG maintains a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess its aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIG's existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two-year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks.   AIG's insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERM's stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation to determine the liquidity required of AIG Parent to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required under stressed scenarios for non-insurance operations, including the Global Capital Markets derivatives portfolio, the Direct Investment book and ILFC.   AIG's consolidated risk target is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer such that AIG Parent's liquidity requirements under the ERM stress scenarios do not exceed 80 percent of AIG Parent's overall liquidity sources over the specified two-year horizon. If the 80 percent minimum threshold is projected to be breached over this defined time horizon, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the target threshold, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions.   AIG has in place unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain domestic Chartis and SunAmerica insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. AIG has also entered into and expects to enter into additional CMAs with certain other insurance companies as needed in 2012. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Chartis, and SunAmerica, below.   Dividend Restrictions   See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of potential restrictions on payments of dividends to common shareholders.   See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG and its subsidiaries.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       ANALYSIS OF SOURCES AND USES OF CASH The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                       Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)   2012   2011            Summary:                  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities    $ 1,632    $ (3,537 )    Net cash provided by investing activities      10,871      37,821      Net cash used in financing activities      (12,721 )    (33,714 )    Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      (24 )    29            Increase (decrease) in cash      (242 )    599      Cash at beginning of year      1,474      1,558      Change in cash of businesses held for sale      -      433            Cash at end of period    $ 1,232    $ 2,590              Operating Cash Flow Activities   Interest payments totaled $2.1 billion and $7.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash paid for interest in the first six months of 2011 includes the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued compounded interest totaling $4.7 billion. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively.   Cash provided by Chartis operating activities was $0.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to cash used of $0.4 billion in the same period in 2011, primarily reflecting lower catastrophe losses that were partially offset by declines in net premiums written as a result of strategic initiatives related to improved risk selection. Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of Chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. The six months ended in 2011 were affected by significant catastrophe losses, including the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and earthquakes in New Zealand.   Cash provided by operating activities by SunAmerica was $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to cash used of $0.3 billion in the same period in 2011, primarily reflecting continued growth in total life sales and a low interest rate environment. Aircraft Leasing generated cash from operating activities of $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion during the same periods. These cash flows reflected operating performance that was generally consistent for Aircraft Leasing in both periods.   The six months ended June 30, 2011 included $2.7 billion of operating cash flows from divested foreign life insurance subsidiaries, including Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison.   Investing Cash Flow Activities   Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2012 includes the following items:   •distributions from SunAmerica related to the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II of approximately $1.6 billion;  •gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion from the first quarter sale of 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares; and  •approximately $1.9 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by SunAmerica.   142 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Net cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to the utilization of previously restricted cash generated from the AIA initial public offering and the disposition of MetLife securities received in the ALICO sale. The restrictions on the cash were released in connection with the Recapitalization in 2011.   Financing Cash Flow Activities   Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2012 includes the following activities:   •$8.6 billion pay down of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV preferred interests;   •total payments of approximately $5.0 billion for the purchase of approximately 169 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and  •total net debt issuances of $6.8 billion detailed in Debt — Debt Maturities below.    Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 primarily resulted from the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $9.1 billion partial repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and the preferred interests in AM Holdings LLC (the ALICO SPV) in connection with the Recapitalization and use of proceeds received from the sales of foreign life insurance entities in 2011, all within Other operations.        LIQUIDITY OF PARENT AND SUBSIDIARIES  AIG Parent   In the first six months of 2012, the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed two registered public offerings of AIG Common Stock:   •On March 13, 2012, the Department of the Treasury sold approximately 207 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion and AIG purchased approximately $3.0 billion of AIG Common Stock in the March Offering at the public offering price of $29.00 per share; and  •On May 10, 2012, the Department of the Treasury sold approximately 189 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $5.7 billion and AIG purchased approximately $2.0 billion of AIG Common Stock in the May Offering at the public offering price of $30.50 per share.    In the first quarter of 2012, AIG issued $750 million principal amount of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.800% Notes Due 2017, the proceeds of which were used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP.   In May 2012, AIG issued $750 million principal amount of 4.875% Notes Due 2022 and in June 2012, AIG issued an additional $750 million principal amount of these notes. The proceeds from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes which are currently expected to include the repayment of debt maturing in 2013.   In March 2012, AIG paid down in full the remaining liquidation preference of the Department of Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests and redeemed the Department of the Treasury's preferred participating return rights under the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV limited liability company agreements.   As a result of these payments, the equity interests in ILFC, the ordinary shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV, the common equity interest in the AIA SPV held by AIG, AIG's interests in ML III, and the $1.6 billion in cash held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife), all of which had been held as security to support the repayments of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests, were released from that pledge.   In connection with the indemnity obligations under the ALICO stock purchase agreement, as of June 30, 2012, approximately $1.6 billion of proceeds from the sale of ALICO were on deposit in an escrow arrangement. On July 13, 2012, MetLife and AIG entered into a letter agreement which among other things, provided that $950 million held in escrow would be released to AIG on August 31, 2012 instead of November 1, 2012 as  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 143      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. originally provided under the ALICO stock purchase agreement. The amount required to be held in escrow declines to zero in May 2013, although indemnification claims then pending will reduce the amount that can be released to AIG.   AIG maintains substantial actual and contingent liquidity.  The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity:                    (In millions)   As of June 30, 2012            Cash and short-term investments(a)    $ 7,259      Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities(b)      3,237      Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facilities(c)      1,000            Total AIG Parent liquidity sources    $ 11,496               (a) Includes reverse repurchase agreements totaling $5.4 billion used to reduce unsecured exposures. (b)For additional information relating to the syndicated bank credit facilities, see Credit Facilities below. (c)For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facilities, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.   Sources of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit facilities and contingent liquidity facilities. In addition, as noted above, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs. In the first six months of 2012, AIG Parent:   •collected $3.6 billion in cash payments from subsidiaries, including $2.4 billion in note repayments from SunAmerica funded by payments of dividends from subsidiaries (representing an acceleration of planned 2012 payments from SunAmerica companies) of which $1.6 billion represented proceeds from the FRBNY's sale of ML II assets, $561 million in dividends from Chartis, and $400 million in dividends from the AIA SPV, representing the proceeds from the sale of shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV to a Chartis subsidiary;  •collected approximately $1.0 billion in non-cash dividends from Chartis in the form of municipal bonds;   •issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP (described more fully in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Other Operations — Direct Investment Book below);  •issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes to be used for general corporate purposes; and   •sold 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion, which proceeds were utilized to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests.    Uses of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, capital management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In the first six months of 2012, AIG Parent:   •retired $3.0 billion of debt, including $2.6 billion of MIP long-term debt, and made interest payments totaling $1.1 billion;  •purchased approximately 169 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the Equity Offerings for approximately $5.0 billion;  •utilized $1.6 billion in proceeds from the disposition of ML II assets to reduce the liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and redeem the Department of the Treasury's preferred participating return rights in the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV;   144 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.    •fully paid down the remaining liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests;   •paid $550 million as a result of final approval of a settlement under the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation; and  •made $40 million in net subsidiary capital contributions.    AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. No assurance can be given, however, that AIG's cash needs will not exceed its projected liquidity. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity, or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   Chartis   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Chartis subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $6.7 billion as of June 30, 2012. Further, Chartis businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which Chartis could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient.   One or more large catastrophes may require AIG to provide support to the affected Chartis operations. In addition, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the relevant subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations, and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of Chartis subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Chartis operations, nationalization, terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.   In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) guidelines and determined based on the companies' statutory financial statements). As a result, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies falls below the specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, AIG will contribute cash or other instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these Chartis insurance companies in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate. In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, subject to board approval, the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or (ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law. The CMAs do not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board or regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 145      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. under the CMAs would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum percentage was 425 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2011, AIG received a total of approximately $1.3 billion in dividends from Chartis and made no contributions to Chartis under the CMAs.   In February 2012, AIG, Chartis and certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies entered into a new, single CMA, which replaces the CMAs entered into in February 2011. The new CMA is structured similarly to the CMAs that it replaces, except that under the new CMA, the total adjusted capital and total authorized control level RBC of these Chartis insurance companies are measured as a group (the Fleet) rather than on an individual company basis. As a result, the new CMA provides that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of the Fleet at or above a specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's projected total authorized control level RBC. The initial specified minimum percentage is 350 percent. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $0.5 billion of cash dividends from Chartis. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $1.5 billion in dividends from Chartis, consisting of cash and municipal bonds, and made no contributions to Chartis under the new CMA.   In March 2012, the National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (NUFI), a Chartis subsidiary, became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. FHLB membership provides participants with access to various services, including access to low-cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage-backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets. These advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes. As of June 30, 2012, NUFI had no advances outstanding under this facility.   During September 2011, a $725 million letter of credit facility was put in place, under which Chartis Inc. and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) acted as co-obligors. ACNL, a Chartis subsidiary and member of the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd's), is required to hold capital at Lloyd's, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2012 and 2013 years of account, the entire FAL requirement of $583 million as of June 30, 2012 was satisfied with a letter of credit.   SunAmerica   Management considers the sources of liquidity for SunAmerica subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Management, however, has recently initiated some specific programs intended to provide additional sources of actual and contingent liquidity. The SunAmerica companies continue to maintain liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2012. In the first six months of 2012, SunAmerica provided $2.4 billion of liquidity to AIG Parent through payment of dividends from insurance subsidiaries. These payments from the insurance companies included a $1.6 billion return of capital distribution of the insurance subsidiaries interests in ML II from the FRBNY's sale of the underlying assets.   The most significant potential liquidity requirements of the SunAmerica companies are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of SunAmerica's investment portfolios, AIG believes that normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk. As part of its risk management framework, SunAmerica continues to evaluate and implement programs to enhance its liquidity position and facilitate SunAmerica's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio, including securities lending programs and other secured financings structured to increase liquidity.   During 2012, SunAmerica began utilizing securities lending programs to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, the SunAmerica companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to highly liquid short-term investments. SunAmerica's liability to the borrower for collateral received was $1.88 billion as of June 30, 2012. In addition, in 2011, certain  146 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. SunAmerica insurance companies became members of the FHLBs in their respective districts, primarily as an additional source of liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. As of June 30, 2012, SunAmerica had borrowed $82 million from the FHLBs.   In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain SunAmerica insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected Company Action Level RBCs. As a result, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies falls below the specified minimum percentage of their respective Company Action Level RBCs, AIG will contribute cash or instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these SunAmerica insurance companies in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate. In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs, subject to board approval, the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or (ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law. The CMAs do not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board and regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMAs would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum percentage was 350 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, which had a specified minimum percentage of 250 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2011, AIG received a total of approximately $1.4 billion in distributions from SunAmerica in the form of note repayments. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, in distributions from SunAmerica in the form of note repayments. AIG made no contributions under the CMAs in either period. Effective March 30, 2012, the specified minimum percentage increased from 350 percent to 435 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage remained at 250 percent.   Aircraft Leasing   ILFC's sources of liquidity include existing cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, future cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities, debt issuances, and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments. On February 23, 2012, ILFC closed on a $900 million senior secured term loan due in 2017. ILFC used the proceeds from this loan to prepay the $457 million outstanding under its five-year syndicated facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The senior secured term loan is secured primarily by a first priority perfected lien on the equity of certain ILFC subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own a pool of aircraft and related leases. Also on February 23, 2012, AeroTurbine amended its revolving credit facility to increase the maximum aggregate amount available by $95 million to $430 million.   On March 19, 2012, ILFC issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $750 million principal amount of 4.875% Notes due 2015 and $750 million principal amount of 5.875% Notes due 2019. Part of the proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to prepay ILFC's $750 million senior secured term loan scheduled to mature in 2015 and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the purchase of aircraft.   On April 12, 2012, ILFC refinanced its $550 million secured term loan due in 2016. The new secured term loan, which matures in April 2016, bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%, as  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 147      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. compared to interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 5.0% and a LIBOR floor of 2.0% for the loan that was refinanced.   On April 23, 2012, ILFC closed on a $203 million senior secured term loan due in 2018. ILFC used the proceeds from this loan for the acquisition of seven new aircraft delivered in 2012.   See Debt herein for further details on ILFC's revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt.   Other Operations   Mortgage Guaranty   AIG currently expects that its Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2012. Further, Mortgage Guaranty businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds ($3.8 billion in the aggregate at June 30, 2012), which they could monetize in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.   Global Capital Markets   Global Capital Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties and executes its derivative trades under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of GCM's transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties. Most of the GCM's credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. AIG estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into AIG's liquidity planning assumptions.   As of June 30, 2012, GCM has total assets of $8.4 billion and total liabilities of $4.8 billion. GCM's assets consists primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM's liabilities consists primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. GCM continues to rely upon AIG Parent to meet most of its collateral and other liquidity requirements in connection with its remaining derivatives portfolio. Collateral posted by operations included in GCM to third parties was $4.4 billion and $5.1 billion at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Collateral obtained by operations included in GCM from third parties was $778 million and $1.2 billion at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.   Direct Investment Book   The DIB is comprised of the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The DIB's assets consist primarily of cash, short term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities and to a lesser extent bank loans, mortgage loans and equity securities. The DIB's liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short term obligations related to unsettled trades and short-term financing obligations. As of June 30, 2012, the DIB had total assets of $37.6 billion and total liabilities of $29.2 billion. The assets and  148 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. liabilities of the DIB exclude the value of interest rate and foreign exchange hedges that are in place related to the cash assets and liabilities of AIGFP included in the DIB. The value of these hedges is included in the assets and liabilities of GCM.   AIG's risk target for the DIB is to maintain sufficient liquidity, at all times, to cover any payments on maturing DIB liabilities even under the stress scenarios defined by ERM. Management believes that the DIB has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its maturing liabilities even in these stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from AIG Parent. If the DIB's risk target is breached, AIG expects to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB's liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.   During the six-months ended June 30, 2012, the DIB used current program liquidity to pay down $4.8 billion in debt. In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, AIG issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, consisting of $750 million principal amount of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.800% Notes Due 2017. The proceeds from the sale of these notes are being used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP and the notes are included within MIP notes payable in the debt outstanding table in "Debt — Debt Maturities" below.   During the first quarter of 2012, AIG allocated cash from the DIB to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests. In exchange, AIG's remaining interest in ML III and the future proceeds from the cash held in escrow to secure indemnities provided to MetLife were allocated to the MIP (See Outlook — Other Operations — Direct Investment Book for further information on the ML III distribution). From time to time, AIG may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB.   Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $5.0 billion and $5.1 billion at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.        CREDIT FACILITIES  AIG maintains credit facilities as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Currently, AIG and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities, including a facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit, summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes and for letter of credit issuance. AIG currently expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. One of the facilities, as noted below, contains a "term-out option" allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. All facilities, except for ILFC's four-year AeroTurbine syndicated credit facility maturing December 2015, are unsecured.

The AIG 4-Year Syndicated Facility provides for $3.0 billion of revolving loans, which includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. In May 2012, the letters of credit outstanding were reduced by $37 million; as a result, the available amount for letters of credit under the 4-Year Syndicated Facility was increased by the same amount. As of June 30, 2012, approximately $1.3 billion of letters of credit were outstanding under the letter of credit sublimit within the 4-Year Syndicated Facility, so that approximately $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $237 million is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on the 364-Day and 4-Year facilities from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.   AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings. However, AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, including covenants relating to AIG's maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth, total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization and total priority debt (defined as debt of AIG's subsidiaries and secured debt of AIG) to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict AIG's access to the facilities and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIG's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   ILFC's three-year credit facility, which became effective January 31, 2011, contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that, among other things, restrict ILFC from entering into secured financing in excess of 30 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets, as defined in the agreement, less $2.0 billion, excluding fixed asset financings. As of June 30, 2012, ILFC would be able to incur an additional $3.3 billion of secured indebtedness under this covenant. Prior to April 16, 2010, ILFC had a $2.5 billion five-year syndicated facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. ILFC subsequently amended and extended the facility to mature in October 2012. ILFC repaid $457 million outstanding under the facility and terminated the facility on February 23, 2012. ILFC is a guarantor for a four-year credit facility entered into by AeroTurbine, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ILFC, whose assets are pledged as security for the outstanding amount. In February 2012, ILFC increased AeroTurbine's facility by $95 million to $430 million.        CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY FACILITIES  AIG has access to contingent liquidity facilities of up to $1 billion as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes:   •In 2010, AIG established a $500 million contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG and the counterparty.   •In October 2011, AIG entered into a contingent liquidity facility under which AIG has the right, for a period of one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years from the date any such put option agreement is entered into, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIG's discretion.    AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings.  150 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                    June 30, 2012            Payments due by Period      (in millions)   Total Payments   Remainder of 2012   2013 - 2014   2015 - 2016   2017   Thereafter            Loss reserves   $ 91,107   $ 11,115   $ 29,336   $ 16,172   $ 5,284   $ 29,200      Insurance and investment contract liabilities     239,557     13,347     27,028     25,494     11,097     162,591      Aircraft purchase commitments     18,509     1,066     3,068     5,669     4,235     4,471      Borrowings     72,092     1,984     12,829     12,571     9,034     35,674      Interest payments on borrowings     53,886     1,966     7,607     6,464     2,601     35,248      Other long-term obligations(a)     162     16     38     15     12     81            Total(b)   $ 475,313   $ 29,494   $ 79,906   $ 66,385   $ 32,263   $ 267,265               (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.  (b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of AIG's credit default swaps require AIG to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At June 30, 2012, the fair value derivative liability was $2.4 billion, relating to the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at June 30, 2012, collateral posted with respect to these swaps was $2.1 billion.        OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                   June 30, 2012            Amount of Commitment Expiring      (in millions)   Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2012   2013 - 2014   2015 - 2016   2017   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                          Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 101   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ 101      Standby letters of credit      322     309     10     3     -     -      Guarantees of indebtedness     185     -     -     -     -     185      All other guarantees(b)      416     62     19     157     54     124      Commitments:                                          Investment commitments(c)     2,523     2,096     268     159     -     -      Commitments to extend credit     402     354     47     -     -     1      Letters of credit     26     15     11     -     -     -      Other commercial commitments(d)     804     18     4     -     -     782            Total(e)   $ 4,779   $ 2,854   $ 359   $ 319   $ 54   $ 1,193               (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (b)Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c)Includes commitments to invest in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (d)Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2012 is expected to be approximately $44 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (e)Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 151      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Securities Financing   The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $259 million and $2.1 billion at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $204 million and $1.6 billion at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.   Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities   While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        DEBT  Debt Maturities  The following table summarizes maturing debt at June 30, 2012 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                (in millions)   Third Quarter 2012   Fourth Quarter 2012   First Quarter 2013   Second Quarter 2013   Total            ILFC   $ 767   $ 162   $ 1,376   $ 737   $ 3,042      Borrowings supported by assets (DIB)     408     497     503     128     1,536      General borrowings     -     150     -     -     150      Other     -     -     46     7     53            Total   $ 1,175   $ 809   $ 1,925   $ 872   $ 4,781              Resources available to meet maturing obligations include:   •ILFC's existing cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, as well as its future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Aircraft Leasing. Additionally, at June 30, 2012, ILFC had $2.0 billion available under its unsecured three-year revolving credit facility and an additional $160 million available under AeroTurbine's secured revolving credit agreement. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance its existing debt or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations.  •AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt included in the DIB. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold or AIG to access the capital markets to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. At June 30, 2012, all of the debt maturities in the DIB through June 30, 2013 are supported by short-term investments and maturing investments.   152 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

CREDIT RATINGS  The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short- and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of July 27, 2012. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.   These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   Adverse ratings actions regarding our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require AIGFP to post additional collateral payments pursuant to, and/or permit the termination of, derivative transactions to which AIGFP is a party, which could adversely affect AIG's business, its consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or its liquidity. Credit ratings estimate a company's ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability to that company of financing. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of AIGFP's counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.   For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of AIG's insurance companies or AIG's credit ratings, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2011 Annual Report.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 155                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.        INVESTMENTS       MARKET CONDITIONS  AIG's investments and investment strategies were affected by the following conditions in the second quarter of 2012:   •Equity and credit markets experienced increased levels of volatility, as U.S. and global economic conditions deteriorated.   •Rating agency downgrades were more pronounced as numerous domestic and international banks received downgrades, with some receiving downgrades of multiple notches. European sovereign debt issues continued to weigh on the markets.  •Equity markets retreated from the highs achieved in the first quarter of 2012, with U.S. and global equity markets finishing down for the second quarter, although they remain up year to date.  •Bond yields were sharply lower in the U.S., as evidenced by the ten year U.S. Treasury rate declining to a historical low of 1.44 percent at the beginning of June before finishing at 1.65 percent at quarter end. High grade and high yield spreads widened in the second quarter, but they narrowed in June.   •The U.S. dollar strengthened 5 percent and 2 percent versus the euro and British pound, respectively, in the quarter with the trend versus the U.S. dollar driven by the uncertainty surrounding European events.         INVESTMENT STRATEGIES  AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.    •In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the DIB, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration.  •Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in Chartis historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of Chartis, cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  •Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Chartis companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.         INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS  An overview of investment activities during the first half of 2012 follows:   •Risk weighted opportunistic investments in RMBS and other structured securities continued to be made to improve yields and increase net investment income. AIG purchased an aggregate of $5.0 billion of CDOs sold in the FRBNY auctions of ML III assets, and elected fair value accounting treatment on those assets.   156 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Purchases of corporate debt securities continued to be the largest asset allocation of new investments.   •The low interest rate environment is a contributing factor to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. In the second quarter of 2012, blended investment yields on new SunAmerica investments, including RMBS and other mortgage loans and securities, were substantially the same as blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called. Base yields at Chartis benefited from blended yields on new instruments that are higher than the yields on investments that were sold, matured or called.   •Other-than-temporary-impairments on structured securities were down significantly from prior quarters.    Net investment income and unrealized and realized gains and losses are discussed under Consolidated Results.   Credit Ratings   At June 30, 2012, approximately 88 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by AIG's domestic entities. Approximately 18 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of AIG's foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities. AIG's Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2012, approximately 21 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 3 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 51 percent of the foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.   With respect to AIG's fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 97 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) AIG's equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity investments that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or AIG, and represents primarily AIG's interest in ML III.

Although the market value of CMBS holdings has remained stable during the first six months of 2012, the portfolio continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.  164 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 165      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       AIA INVESTMENT  On March 7, 2012, AIG sold 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA for gross cash proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion (the AIA Sale). As a result of the sale, AIG's retained interest in AIA decreased from approximately 33 percent to approximately 19 percent. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the carrying value of AIG's retained interest in AIA was $7.7 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, which was recorded in Other invested assets and accounted for under the fair value option.   The value of the AIA ordinary shares will fluctuate until their ultimate disposition by AIG. The value of these shares will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of AIA. AIG is restricted from selling any of its remaining AIA ordinary shares to third parties or entering into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of its remaining interest in AIA until September 4, 2012. After that date, AIG expects to monetize its investment in AIA ordinary shares from time to time depending on market conditions, AIG's liquidity position and opportunities for cash redeployment.

Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 169                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 related to:   •issuer-specific credit events;  •securities for which AIG has changed its intent from hold to sell;  •declines due to foreign exchange rates;  •certain structured securities;  •other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts; and  •securities that experienced severe market valuation declines.    With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.10 percent and 0.05 percent of Total equity in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $231 million and $111 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $453 million and $214 million, for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(b)Represents the percentage by which fair value is less than cost at June 30, 2012. (c)For bonds, represents amortized cost. (d)The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC. (e)Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.   For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $4.4 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of June 30, 2012, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for 12 months or more consisted of the unrealized loss of $318 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 19 securities with an amortized cost of $45 million and a net unrealized loss of $26 million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate-related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive.   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT       OVERVIEW  Risk management is a key element of AIG's approach to corporate governance. AIG has an integrated process for managing risks throughout the organization. The Board has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. AIG's ERM Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of AIG's major business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view on the firm's major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM.   For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Part II, Item 7.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (fair value changes and potential future exposure), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties, commercial bank letters of credit received as collateral, guarantees, credit default swaps sold, and the specified credit equivalent exposures to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. Therefore, AIG's reported credit  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 171      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. exposures to a counterparty reflect available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, trading securities, derivative exposures, insurance credit and any other counterparty credit exposures.   AIG monitors and controls its company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempts to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in certain circumstances, AIG may require third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. These guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts are also treated as credit exposure and are added to AIG's risk concentration exposure data.   AIG's single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 23 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2012 compared to 30 percent at December 31, 2011. Exposure to the U.S. Government primarily includes credit exposure related to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and to direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) based upon their U.S. Government conservatorship. The reduction in exposure was primarily related to U.S. government-sponsored entities. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at June 30, 2012, AIG's largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure, apart from ILFC leasing arrangements secured by aircraft with airlines having below investment grade ratings, was related to a non-financial corporate counterparty and that exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2012, compared to 0.5 percent at December 31, 2011.   AIG's single largest industry credit exposure at June 30, 2012 was to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of June 30, 2012, credit exposure to this sector was $95.3 billion, or 90 percent of Total equity compared to 106 percent at December 31, 2011.   At June 30, 2012:   •$90.2 billion, or 95 percent, of these global financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings.  •$5.1 billion, or 5 percent, were considered non-investment grade. Most of the non-investment grade exposure was to financial institutions in countries AIG does not consider of investment grade quality. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade-rated financial institutions was $2.2 billion.  •AIG's aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $36.1 billion.  •Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $19.0 billion, or 20 percent of the total global financial institution credit exposure.  •The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, AIA ordinary shares, and the fronting of risk management policies to captive insurers of these financial institutions.    Of the $95.3 billion aggregate financial exposure, $32.6 billion was to United Kingdom and European-based financial institutions.    •$10.7 billion of this aggregate credit exposure was to non-bank institutions, mostly insurers and reinsurers, with $7.9 billion, or 74 percent of credit exposure representing reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. $1.2 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non-banks was fixed maturity securities. Approximately 95 percent of the non-bank exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings.   172 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Aggregate credit exposures to the United Kingdom- and European-based banks totaled $21.8 billion, of which $20.2 billion were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade-rated credit exposures to European banks were $1.6 billion.   •AIG's credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $8.4 billion, of which $4.4 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the five countries of the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $1.2 billion, of which $822 million were fixed maturity securities. These credit exposures are primarily in Spain and Italy. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $1.7 billion, of which $747 million were fixed maturity securities. AIG's credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.

Covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and which have full recourse to the issuing bank) represented approximately 9 percent of the $10.5 billion fixed maturity securities. (b)Cash and short-term investments include bank deposit placements, operating accounts, securities purchased under agreements to resell and collateral posted to counterparties against structured products. Credit equivalent exposure to securities purchased under agreements to resell was $149 million (notional value of $3.0 billion). (c)Derivative transactions are reported at fair value. (d)Other primarily consists of commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures ($1.6 billion) and captive risk management programs in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands ($1.7 billion).   Out of a total of $4.4 billion of fixed maturity securities issued by banks in the Euro-Zone countries, AIG's subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $1.1 billion and $331 million, respectively, at June 30, 2012. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 173                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

(b) Secured/government primarily includes covered bonds and securities issued by government-sponsored entities or debt guaranteed by a government.   Approximately 80 percent of the fixed maturity securities of the United Kingdom and European non-financial institutions held by AIG were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Apart from ILFC equipment leased under operating leases to airlines, non-financial institution corporate exposure to Euro-Zone countries totaled $18.1 billion, with France representing the largest single country exposure of $5.8 billion. $10.6 billion of the Euro-Zone exposures were fixed maturity securities of which $2.4 billion was in France. Approximately two-thirds of the French exposures were to issuers in the oil and gas, rail, utilities and telecommunications industries. Euro-Zone fixed maturity securities represented 30 percent of total non-financial institution corporate exposure in the United Kingdom and Europe. Euro-Zone periphery non-financial institution corporate exposures ($5 billion) are heavily weighted towards large multinational corporations or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (26 percent), telecommunications (18 percent) and food and beverage (8 percent).  174 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

(b)United Kingdom / European exposure also consists of $299 million of subordinated debt, primarily in the United Kingdom and Spain; bank loans of $85 million; and preferred equity securities of $40 million. (c)Other primarily consists of insurance related products, including captive fronting programs ($6.8 billion), trade credit insurance ($3.5 billion) and surety insurance ($2.0 billion).   AIG also had credit exposures to several European governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in the recent past by one or more of the major rating agencies. These downgrades occurred mostly in countries in the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy and Portugal) where AIG's credit exposures totaled $326 million at June 30, 2012. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits, rising government debt-to-GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these sovereigns, which have given rise to widening credit spreads and difficult financing conditions. These credit exposures primarily included available-for-sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. AIG had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece or Ireland.   AIG's aggregate credit exposure to the government of Japan was $8.9 billion at June 30, 2012. A significant majority of these securities were held in the investment portfolios of AIG's Japanese insurance operations.

United Kingdom structured products accounted for $4.0 billion or 56 percent of these exposures, while the Netherlands and Germany comprised 26 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the Euro-Zone periphery accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 90 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at June 30, 2012 based on external rating agency ratings.   In addition, AIG had commercial real estate-related net equity investments in Europe totaling $337 million and related unfunded commitments of $90 million.   ILFC's fleet includes aircraft on operating leases to United Kingdom and European airlines with a net book value of approximately $12.5 billion, of which approximately $2.9 billion, or 23 percent, are aircraft on lease to carriers based in the five Euro-Zone periphery countries.   AIG actively monitors its European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the Euro-Zone periphery, and uses various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine whether mitigating actions should be taken. Mitigating actions in these areas to date have largely included non-renewal of maturing exposures and sales and tender of securities. To date, AIG's purchases of credit default swap protection have been minimal. The financial condition of issuers is periodically evaluated, and internal risk ratings are adjusted as circumstances warrant. The result of these continuing reviews has led AIG to believe that its combined credit risk exposures to sovereign governments, financial institutions and non-financial corporations in the Euro-Zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers.  176 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  AIG also monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Six countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at June 30, 2012, three countries were rated AAA and three were rated AA. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and France.   AIG also has a risk concentration, primarily through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies, in the U.S. municipal sector. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property and casualty insurance companies. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. AIG had $808 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios at June 30, 2012, compared to $892 million at December 31, 2011. These exposures consisted of AIGFP derivatives and trading securities (at fair value) and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.   AIG reviews regularly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. AIG periodically adjusts limits and reviews exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that it does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.        MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  Insurance and Aircraft Leasing Sensitivities  The following table provides estimates of AIG's sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                   Exposure        Effect      (dollars in millions)   June 30, 2012   December 31, 2011*   Sensitivity Factor   June 30, 2012   December 31, 2011            Yield sensitive assets    $ 330,700    $ 326,200    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves    $ (15,800 )  $ (15,800 )          Equity and alternative investments exposure    $ 33,900    $ 39,000    20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments    $ (6,800 )  $ (7,800 )          Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure    $ 6,000    $ 5,900    10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar    $ (600 )  $ (590 )            Exposures to yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables, receivables from aircraft equipment under leases, and short-term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIG's consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis.    •Total yield sensitive assets increased 1.4 percent, or $4.5 billion, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to an increase in cash of $4.9 billion, partially offset by a decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of $360 million.   •Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 12.9 percent, or $5.0 billion, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to a decrease of $5.1 billion related to AIG's sale of AIA equity securities as well as decreases in other common equity securities of $698 million and mutual fund values of $126 million. The decrease was partially offset by increases in partnership values of $592 million, real estate investments of $142 million and other equity investments of $195 million.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 177      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 1.6 percent, or $92 million, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to increases in market values of fixed maturity securities of $324 million, a reduction in euro denominated debt outstanding of $231 million, changes in Canadian dollar-denominated unearned premium reserves of $378 million, and a net exposure increase in the portfolio across currencies of $74 million. The increase was partially offset by decreases in Japanese yen exposure related to the adoption of a new DAC accounting standard of $717 million and Hong Kong dollar exposure related to equity holdings of $200 million.    The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors are the same as those used in the 2011 Annual Report.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:   •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax planning strategies and operating profitability of the character necessary for their realization;  •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs, flight equipment, and reinsurance;   •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;  •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;  •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments;  •liabilities for legal contingencies; and  •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including CDS.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. The following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2012. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, see the 2011 Annual Report.        RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET:  AIG considers the recoverability of its deferred tax asset to be a critical accounting estimate. The evaluation of the recoverability of AIG's deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.   See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets.  178 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.        RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS – SHORT DURATION (CHARTIS):  Recoverability of DAC is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months for short-duration insurance contracts. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.   For short-duration insurance contracts, starting on January 1, 2012, AIG has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable. AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy, as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.   AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on inforce business to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses, anticipated policy maintenance costs and unamortized DAC. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income for Chartis exceeded the sum of these costs at June 30, 2012.   On January 1, 2012, AIG adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $5.1 billion decrease in the January 1, 2012 consolidated DAC balance.        FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES:  See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.   Overview  The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                       June 30, 2012 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 264     89 %    Fair value based on internal sources     33     11            Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 297     100 %             (a) Includes $20.1 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.   AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 179      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Level 3 Assets and Liabilities   Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   At June 30, 2012, AIG classified $46.6 billion and $4.7 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 8.4 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2012. At December 31, 2011, AIG classified $39.4 billion and $5.3 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 7.1 percent and 1.2 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. AIG considers unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular unobservable input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   AIG classifies fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.   Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio   The entities included in Global Capital Markets operations wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIG is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, those entities also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class:                                                             Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss)                  Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at          Net Notional Amount    Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,          June 30, 2012(a)   December 31, 2011(a)   June 30, 2012(b)(c)   December 31, 2011(b)(c)     (in millions)   2012(c)   2011(c)   2012(c)   2011(c)            Regulatory Capital:                                                      Corporate loans    $ 1,148    $ 1,830    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -      Prime residential mortgages      648      3,653      -      -      -      -      -      6      Other      754      887      6      9      (3 )    1      3      10            Total      2,550      6,370      6      9      (3 )    1      3      16            Arbitrage:                                                      Multi-sector CDOs(d)      4,602      5,476      2,386      3,077      68      (90 )    194      183      Corporate debt/CLOs(e)      11,630      11,784      116      127      (6 )    7      11      44            Total      16,232      17,260      2,502      3,204      62      (83 )    205      227            Mezzanine tranches      985      989      21      10      (2 )    (12 )    (11 )    (14 )          Total    $ 19,767    $ 24,619    $ 2,529    $ 3,223    $ 57    $ (94 )  $ 197    $ 229               (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

(c)Includes credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) of $2 million and $8 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $(24) million and $2 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing the effect of changes in AIG's credit spreads on the valuation of the derivatives liabilities. (d)During the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, a super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $470 million was terminated at approximately its fair value at the time of termination. As a result, a $416 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, $81 million was paid to counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, an $81 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Multi-sector CDOs also include $3.9 billion and $4.6 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. (e)Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.2 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                       (in millions)   June 30, 2012   December 31, 2011            Regulatory capital    $ 3    $ 9      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO      2,066      2,711      Arbitrage – corporate      451      477            Total    $ 2,520    $ 3,197                    Regulatory Capital Portfolio    During the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, $1.9 billion in net notional amount of regulatory capital CDSs were terminated or matured at no cost. The expected maturity of this portfolio continues to be monitored. As of June 30, 2012, the estimated weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was one year. There have been no requirements to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for financial institution counterparties was  AIG 2012 Form 10-Q 181      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2012 other than for transactions where Global Capital Markets believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief. Although AIG believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and the expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.       Arbitrage Portfolio    A portion of the super senior credit default swaps as of June 30, 2012 are arbitrage-motivated transactions written on multi-sector CDOs or designated pools of investment grade senior unsecured corporate debt or CLOs.   Multi-Sector CDOs  The following table summarizes gross transaction notional amount of the multi-sector CDOs on which protection was written on the super senior tranche, subordination below the super senior risk layer, net notional amount and fair value of derivative liability by underlying collateral type:                             June 30, 2012   (in millions)   Gross Transaction Notional Amount(a)   Subordination Below the Super Senior Risk Layer   Net Notional Amount   Fair Value of Derivative Liability            High grade with subprime collateral   $ 2,425   $ 1,258   $ 1,167   $ 498      High grade with no subprime collateral     2,853     1,140     1,713     613            Total high grade(b)     5,278     2,398     2,880     1,111            Mezzanine with subprime collateral     1,955     550     1,405     1,067      Mezzanine with no subprime collateral     603     286     317     208            Total mezzanine(c)     2,558     836     1,722     1,275            Total   $ 7,836   $ 3,234   $ 4,602   $ 2,386               (a) Total outstanding principal amount of securities held by a CDO.  (b) "High grade" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand-alone basis were predominantly AA or higher at origination. (c)"Mezzanine" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand-alone basis were predominantly A or lower at origination.   Corporate Debt/CLOs   The corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of CDS written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the CDS. These CDS transactions require cash settlement. This portfolio also includes CDS with a net notional amount of $1.2 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of CLOs, which require physical settlement.  182 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Valuation Sensitivity – Arbitrage Portfolio    Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased during 2012. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $4.6 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at June 30, 2012, a BET value is available for $2.9 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.7 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $2.9 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at June 30, 2012 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                           Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at June 30, 2012         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS Prime   RMBS Alt-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     35 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (181 ) $ (3 ) $ (13 ) $ (88 ) $ (48 ) $ (19 ) $ (10 )                Decrease of 5 points     168     3     13     77     48     12     15            Weighted         Increase of 1 year     22     1     1     16     2     2     -      average life     6.08 years   Decrease of 1 year     (35 )   (1 )   (1 )   (26 )   (4 )   (2 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     16%   Increase of 10%     (15 )   -     (4 )   (8 )   (1 )   (1 )   (1 )                Decrease of 10%     18     -     3     11     2     1     1            Diversity score(a)     13   Increase of 5     (3 )                                                 Decrease of 5     14                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     18                                                   (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. (b)The discount curve is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. Furthermore, for this input it is not possible to disclose a weighted average input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points.   These results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption. No assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed, perhaps significantly, the ranges assumed by AIG for purposes of the above analysis. No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2012, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.   There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  184 AIG 2012 Form 10-Q                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1. Legal Proceedings  For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 9(A) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.       Item 1A. Risk Factors  In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and discussed throughout Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on February 27, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively, and throughout Exhibit 99.2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2012 (collectively, the 2011 Annual Report).   The following risk factor, originally included in the 2011 Annual Report, has been updated to read as follows:   If we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer, employee, and company data and information. Some of these systems in turn, rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or other disruption inside or outside the U.S., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Our systems could also be subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. AIG maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. In some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.   In addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could result in remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.
