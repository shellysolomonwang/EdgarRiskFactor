Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 (2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K) and Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of each of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2010 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. Underwriting profit (loss) is utilized to report results for AIG's General Insurance operations and pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is utilized to report results for AIG's life insurance and retirement services operations as these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.   AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.     Executive Overview    AIG reports the results of its operations through four reportable segments: General Insurance, Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, and Financial Services.    •General Insurance — branded as Chartis in 2009, is comprised of multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad.   •Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services — branded as SunAmerica Financial Group in 2009. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance, and group life and health products. In addition, Domestic Life Insurance offers a variety of payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Domestic Retirement Services businesses offer group retirement products and individual fixed and variable annuities. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and other fixed and variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. Domestic Retirement Services also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were written in (or issued to) the institutional market place prior to 2006.   •Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — provides insurance and investment-oriented products such as whole and term life, investment linked, universal life and endowments, personal accident and health products, and group products including pension, life and health, and fixed annuities. As discussed in   99      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Significant Events — AIA Transaction, this segment includes the results of American International Assurance, Limited (AIA).    •Financial Services — engages in diversified activities, including commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations, consumer finance and insurance premium financing, both in the United States and abroad.      Priorities for 2010   AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2010:    •continuing the stabilization and strengthening of AIG's businesses;   •realizing additional progress in restructuring and asset disposition initiatives to enable repayment of amounts outstanding under the FRBNY credit facility (the FRBNY Credit Facility) provided by the FRBNY under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Agreement), between AIG and the FRBNY;   •closing the pending sales transactions for American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) and Nan Shan and implementing plans to monetize securities expected to be received upon the ALICO closing;   •execute on plans to conduct an initial public offering of shares of AIA, by seeking a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions;   •addressing AIG's highly leveraged capital structure;   •continuing the wind-down of AIG's exposure to certain financial products and derivatives trading activities;   •continuing to address the long-term financing needs of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and American General Finance, Inc. (AGF), including the potential sale of AGF.      2010 Financial Overview   AIG's income from continuing operations before income taxes amounted to $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2010, significantly higher than the $171 million reported in the same period of 2009. These results reflected the following:    •an improvement in earnings for the Mortgage Guaranty business of $733 million resulting from lower levels of newly reported delinquencies, higher mortgage cure rates and the effect of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies;   •a net gain on sales of divested businesses of $198 million in the second quarter of 2010, reflecting $228 million of income related to the termination of the AIA sale transaction, compared to losses of $566 million in the same period in 2009; and   •a decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges on available for sale securities of $210 million.    This improvement was partially offset by a securities litigation charge of $500 million recorded during the second quarter of 2010 compared to a charge of $225 million in the same period of 2009.   During the second quarter of 2010, Chartis completed the accounting for the Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) acquisition and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded, which resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $406 million. The bargain purchase gain is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and excluded from the three months ended June 30, 2010. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   AIG recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $3.4 billion during the second quarter of 2010. These results included the impairment of $3.3 billion of goodwill that had been allocated to ALICO as a consequence of ALICO's removal from the Japan and Other operating segment. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Goodwill impairment for further discussion.  100      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     2010 Business Outlook   The following discussion supplements and updates the Business Outlook contained in AIG's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010.     General Insurance    On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Chartis International subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji, a publicly traded Japanese insurance company with general insurance and some life operations. Fuji's financial information is reported on a one-quarter lag. As a result, Fuji's results will be consolidated beginning in the third quarter of 2010, and will be reported in the Foreign General Insurance operating segment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma results and additional information about the terms of the acquisition.   On April 20, 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig, operating in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, resulted in a fire that led to the sinking of the rig and subsequent oil spill. AIG's net exposure to property loss on this event was approximately $23 million; this has been paid. AIG continues to monitor the casualty exposure to Deepwater Horizon and believes that carried loss reserves at June 30, 2010 are adequate to cover estimated losses attributable to this event. However, AIG's claims estimates may change over time, as the forensic investigation is incomplete, the cleanup is incomplete, and the litigation has only just begun.   There may also be other policyholders involved as the matter evolves. The types of claims may include, but not be limited to, cleanup costs, both directly incurred and those for which reimbursement to the government may be required; natural resource damages, including damages to the various fisheries impacted by the spill; property damage to private property; business interruption to Gulf Coast businesses; the bodily injury and wrongful death claims of the workers on the rig; claims for the destruction of the rig itself and various class actions brought by Gulf Coast residents on various theories of liability. In addition, it is uncertain how the $20 billion cleanup fund established by BP may affect claims under Chartis' policies, as injured parties may seek compensation from the fund rather than through their own or others' insurance policies.     Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services    AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies. Pools of highly-rated third party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance companies also cede excess, non-economic reserves carried on a statutory-basis only on certain term and universal life insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to an offshore affiliate.   AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of its intercompany reinsurance transactions. For this purpose, AIG has a $2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility outstanding at June 30, 2010, all of which relates to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. AIG has also obtained approximately $2.3 billion of letters of credit on a bilateral basis all of which relates to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. All of these letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015.   The fees paid to maintain these bilateral letters of credit are generally based on AIG's long-term debt ratings. Under the terms of the bilateral letter of credit, the issuing bank has the right to base its fees on AIG's credit default swap pricing. On June 30, 2010, AIG received notification of the bank's intent to do so. This change will increase the fees for maintaining this letter of credit from $16 million annually to approximately $87 million, based on credit default swap pricing levels.     Mortgage Guaranty    The improvement in UGC's results is primarily the result of declining levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans, the effect of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies, increased rescission activity on  101      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  domestic first-lien and second-lien claims and increased efforts to modify payment plans for currently delinquent loans. If these trends persist, UGC's financial results may continue to show improvement in future quarters. However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the longer term outlook for the housing market, U.S. unemployment rates, the impact of future foreclosures on domestic home prices, loan modification programs, the elimination of tax credits for first-time homebuyers and mortgage insurance rescission rates and the effects, if any, these factors will have on UGC's financial results.     AIGFP Wind-Down    During the second quarter of 2010, AIG continued to make progress winding down AIGFP's derivatives portfolio. At June 30, 2010, the portfolio was $602.4 billion (including $19.1 billion of intercompany derivatives), of which $89.5 billion were super senior credit default swap contracts. AIG expects to continue to reduce the size of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio through the remainder of the year. If the wind-down continues as anticipated, AIG expects that late in 2010 or early in 2011 the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio will consist of transactions AIG believes will be of low complexity or of low risk or not economically feasible to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. During the latter stages of the wind-down, AIG expects to assume direct management of the investments and debt obligations of AIGFP, at which time the performance of those assets and liabilities will no longer be reported as part of Capital Markets. However, AIG anticipates that the remaining derivatives business will continue to be reported as Capital Markets.     FRBNY Credit Facility    The FRBNY has been considering whether prior payments made by AIG to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility from asset sales should be treated as mandatory prepayments that reduce the amount available under the FRBNY Credit Facility. If the FRBNY takes this position, at June 30, 2010, this would reduce the amount available to be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility by approximately $3.6 billion. Such reduction in the FRBNY Credit Facility would trigger accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of approximately $600 million.     Significant Events in 2010     ALICO Sale    As of March 7, 2010, AIG and ALICO Holdings LLC, a special purpose vehicle formed by AIG (ALICO Holdings) entered into a definitive agreement (the ALICO Stock Purchase Agreement) with MetLife for the sale of ALICO by ALICO Holdings to MetLife, and the sale of Delaware American Life Insurance Company by AIG to MetLife, for approximately $15.5 billion, consisting of $6.8 billion in cash and the remainder in equity securities of MetLife, subject to closing adjustments.   The cash portion of the proceeds from this sale will be paid to the FRBNY to reduce the liquidation preference of a portion of the preferred interests owned by the FRBNY in ALICO Holdings (together with the preferred interests owned by the FRBNY in AIA Holdings, the Preferred Interests). Upon the closing of this sale to MetLife, ALICO Holdings will receive and pay to the FRBNY the cash consideration and will hold the remainder of the transaction consideration, consisting of 78,239,712 shares of MetLife common stock, 6,857,000 shares of newly issued participating preferred stock convertible into 68,570,000 shares of common stock upon the approval of MetLife shareholders, and 40,000,000 equity units of MetLife with an aggregate stated value of $3 billion. AIG intends to monetize these MetLife securities over time, subject to market conditions, following the lapse of agreed-upon minimum holding periods. Approximately $3 billion in MetLife securities will be held in escrow to support indemnity claims which will wind-down over a 30-month period. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net cash proceeds from the monetization of these securities will be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the Preferred Interests owned by the FRBNY in ALICO Holdings and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility.  102      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    Retained Financial Interest    In the case of the sale of ALICO, the value of the securities consideration is subject to fluctuation from the date of signing of the ALICO Stock Purchase Agreement, through closing of sale and the ultimate monetization by AIG of the MetLife securities. These fluctuations will be influenced by market prices of MetLife securities generally, and the market prices of MetLife common stock in particular, which will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of MetLife. AIG is subject in each case to agreed-upon minimum holding periods that also restrict AIG's ability to enter into hedging transactions that might protect AIG against fluctuations in the value of the securities consideration. These minimum holding periods and hedging restrictions cannot be altered without the consent of MetLife, so AIG will bear the risk of these market price fluctuations during the applicable holding periods. The amount of any gain or loss recognized by AIG upon each sale will depend upon the fair value of the securities consideration received as of closing and the proceeds received by AIG from the monetization of the securities. This may also result in AIG realizing ultimate cash proceeds from the monetization of the securities consideration that is substantially less than what might be expected from the value of such consideration as of the date of signing of the purchase agreement. During the holding period, AIG will carry these securities as available-for-sale investments, with changes in the fair value of the securities recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).     AIA Transaction    On June 1, 2010, Prudential proposed revised terms to acquire AIA. AIG's Board of Directors declined the proposal. On June 2, 2010, AIG and Prudential terminated the transaction. As a result, AIG concluded that it is no longer probable that it will close a sale of AIA within twelve months. Accordingly, AIA is no longer being presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements. AIA was presented as a discontinued operation in AIG's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Accordingly, AIA's results of operations are included in the Asia operating segment within the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services reportable segment and comprise the majority of that operating segment.   In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, Prudential paid AIG a termination fee of $228 million, which was included in Net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).     ILFC and AGF Liquidity    During the first six months of 2010, ILFC and AGF made substantial progress in addressing their liquidity needs.   During the first six months of 2010, ILFC significantly increased its liquidity position through a combination of new secured and unsecured debt issuances of approximately $4.0 billion and an extension of the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Availability of $501 million of the approximately $4.0 billion of debt issuances and the extension of $2.16 billion of the revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. In addition, during the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, ILFC agreed to sell 61 aircraft to third parties, of which 56 aircraft, with an aggregate book value of approximately $2.6 billion, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The aircraft classified as held for sale are expected to generate approximately $2.2 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, three of the 61 aircraft were sold, of which one had been classified as held for sale. At June 30, 2010, 55 aircraft were recorded in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.   During the first six months of 2010, AGF received cash proceeds of more than $500 million from a $1.0 billion asset securitization and executed and drew down fully a $3.0 billion five-year secured term loan. AGF used a portion of the proceeds from these transactions, cash on hand and proceeds from AIG's repayment of two demand promissory notes to repay all of its outstanding obligations under its $2.45 billion one-year term loans and its $2.125 billion five-year revolving credit facility (both of which were due in July 2010). See Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity — Financial Services for further discussion.  103      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    Sale of Interest in Transatlantic    On March 15, 2010, AIG closed a secondary public offering of 8,466,693 shares of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic) common stock owned by American Home Assurance Company, a subsidiary of AIG, for aggregate gross proceeds of $452 million.     Consideration of AIG's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management has assessed whether AIG has the ability to continue as a going concern. In making this assessment, AIG has considered:    •The commitment of the U.S. government to continue to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due;   •AIG's liquidity-related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •The additional capital provided or committed through the Department of the Treasury Commitment (as defined below under Department of the Treasury Commitment);   •The provisions of the definitive agreement for the sale of ALICO;   •The planned initial public offering of AIA;   •The level of AIG's realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders' equity and on the capital levels of AIG's insurance subsidiaries;   •The continuing liquidity needs in certain of AIG's businesses and AIG's actions to address such needs; and   •The substantial risks to which AIG is subject.    In considering these items, management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of AIG's risks and uncertainties. Management also assessed other items and risks arising in AIG's businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto. After consideration, management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG's businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.   It is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management's plans could be materially different or that one or more of management's significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of the risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect. If one or more of these possible outcomes is realized and third party financing is not available, AIG may need additional U.S. government support to meet its obligations as they come due. Under these adverse assumptions, if additional support is not available in such circumstances, there could exist substantial doubt about AIG's ability to operate as a going concern.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding going concern considerations.     Capital Resources and Liquidity     Liquidity     Overview    At June 30, 2010, remaining amounts available under the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury Commitment were $13.3 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively, compared to $17.1 billion and $24.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Voluntary repayments have reduced net borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility by approximately $1.2 billion from June 30, 2010 to July 28, 2010.   AIG manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels. AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.  104      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIG expects that dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries will support the parent's liquidity needs; the FRBNY Credit Facility is also expected to continue to be a source of liquidity, although going forward, AIG expects to reduce its reliance on it. In addition, the Department of the Treasury Commitment may also be used as a source of funding, primarily to support the capital needs of AIG's insurance company subsidiaries. AIG expects the parent's primary uses of available cash will be debt service and subsidiary funding. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, net proceeds from the sales of operations and assets are expected to be used to pay the Preferred Interests and to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes.   AIG expects that its subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due for at least the next twelve months through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, maturing investments and asset sales as well as potential debt issuances.   See further discussion regarding AIG's liquidity considerations in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries.   Analysis of sources and uses of cash  The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                         Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)   2010   2009            Summary:                    Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities    $ 9,771    $ 8,036        Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities      (6,067 )    7,534        Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities      (4,527 )    (18,441 )      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      (92 )    31            Change in cash      (915 )    (2,840 )    Cash at beginning of period      4,400      8,642      Reclassification of assets held for sale      (645 )    -            Cash at end of period    $ 2,840    $ 5,802              Net cash provided by operating activities was positive for both the first six months of 2010 and 2009, principally due to continued positive cash flows from AIG's life insurance subsidiaries.   Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits, but the ability of general insurance operations to generate positive cash flow is affected by operating expenses, the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies, as well as by policy retention rates. Cash provided by General Insurance operations was $729 million for the first six months of 2010 compared to $652 million in the same period in 2009 as a reduction in claims paid was partially offset by declines in premiums collected, arising primarily from a decrease in domestic production. Catastrophic events and significant casualty losses, the timing and effect of which are inherently unpredictable, reduce operating cash flow for AIG's General Insurance operations. Cash provided by AIG's life insurance subsidiaries, including entities presented as discontinued operations, was $6.6 billion for the first six months of 2010 compared to $5.5 billion in the same period in 2009 as growth in international markets was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from domestic operations. Cash flows provided from Financial Services were $2.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily due to the wind-down of AIGFP.   The AIGFP wind-down and other segment developments affecting net income described above are further discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Accrued compounding interest and fees (reflected as non-cash expenses) were paid-in-kind in both periods under the provisions of the FRBNY Credit Facility and, accordingly, did not reduce operating cash flow in either period. Debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility includes total accrued compounding interest and fees of $6.0 billion at June 30, 2010, the payment of which will be reflected as a reduction in operating cash flows in the period that the accrued compounding interest and fees for the FRBNY Credit Facility are paid.  105                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, due to AIG's ability to invest cash generated from operating activities, and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in the 2008 and 2009 time frame. In the first six months of 2009, Net cash provided by investing activities resulted from the net proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments.   Net cash used in financing activities was significantly lower in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of declines in policyholder contract withdrawals, reflecting improved conditions for the life insurance and retirement services businesses, as well as the issuances of long-term debt by ILFC, which is discussed in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC. See Contractual Obligations herein for additional information.       FRBNY Credit Facility   The following table presents changes in net borrowings outstanding and the remaining available amount that can be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility:                      Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 (in millions)                Net borrowings outstanding, January 1, 2010   $ 17,900        Loans to AIGFP for collateral postings, GIA and other maturities     1,350        AIGFP repayments to AIG     (924 )      Debt payments     2,202        AIG Funding commercial paper maturities     2,000        Dividends from subsidiaries     (649 )      Net loan repayments to AGF     800        Net cash proceeds from asset sales applied as mandatory prepayments     (1,272 )      Other borrowings and repayments, net     (930 )          Net borrowings outstanding, June 30, 2010     20,477      Accrued compounding interest and fees inception through December 31, 2009     5,535      Accrued compounding interest and fees January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010(a)     445            Total balance outstanding, June 30, 2010   $ 26,457            Total FRBNY Credit Facility, January 1, 2010(b)   $ 35,000        Mandatory prepayments     (1,272 )          Total FRBNY Credit Facility, June 30, 2010(b)   $ 33,728        Less: borrowings outstanding, June 30, 2010     (20,477 )          Remaining available amount, June 30, 2010(b)   $ 13,251               (a)Excludes interest payable of $2.7 million at June 30, 2010, which was included in Other liabilities. (b)The FRBNY has been considering whether prior payments made by AIG to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility from asset sales should be treated as mandatory prepayments that reduce the amount available under the FRBNY Credit Facility. If the FRBNY takes this position, at June 30, 2010, this would reduce the amount available to be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility by approximately $3.6 billion. Such reduction in the FRBNY Credit Facility would trigger accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of approximately $600 million.       Department of the Treasury Commitment    On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which (i) AIG issued to the Department of the Treasury (a) 300,000 shares of AIG Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series F Preferred Stock), and (b) a warrant to purchase 150 shares of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), and (ii) the Department of the Treasury agreed to provide up to $29.835 billion (Department of the Treasury Commitment) in exchange for increases in the liquidation preference of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.  106      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents changes in drawdowns and the remaining available amount under the Department of the Treasury Commitment:                      Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 (in millions)                Total drawdowns, January 1, 2010   $ 5,344        Redemption and repurchase of securities held by insurance subsidiaries     2,148        UGC related restructuring transactions     48        Temporary repayment of FRBNY Credit Facility     3            Total drawdowns, June 30, 2010   $ 7,543            Total Department of the Treasury commitment, January 1, 2010   $ 29,835        Less: drawdowns, June 30, 2010     (7,543 )          Remaining available amount, June 30, 2010   $ 22,292              Additional details regarding liquidity sources are included in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries below.       AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due    Future Cash Requirements   AIG expects that the repayment of future debt maturities (including the FRBNY Credit Facility) and the payment of the preferred returns and liquidation preference on the Preferred Interests will be its primary uses of available cash. Unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY, the net proceeds from the cash consideration and the monetization of the securities consideration from the sale of ALICO will first be used to pay the Preferred Interests, and then to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility.  The following table summarizes the maturing debt at June 30, 2010 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                 (in millions)   Third Quarter 2010   Fourth Quarter 2010   First Quarter 2011   Second Quarter 2011   Total            ILFC   $ 1,933   $ 2,502   $ 1,488   $ 1,278   $ 7,201      AGF     691     228     687     791     2,397      AIG Matched Investment Program     926     758     -     1,117     2,801      AIGFP     309     358     193     100     960      AIG     -     500     12     -     512      Other     508     7     7     5     527            Total   $ 4,367   $ 4,353   $ 2,387   $ 3,291   $ 14,398              AIG's plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows:    •ILFC's sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales (see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC below). During the first six months of 2010, ILFC significantly increased its liquidity position through a combination of new secured and unsecured debt issuances of approximately $4.0 billion and an extension of the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Availability of $501 million of the approximately $4.0 billion of debt issuances and the extension of $2.16 billion of the revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. In addition, during the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, ILFC agreed to sell 61 aircraft to third parties. These sales are expected to generate approximately $2.2 billion in gross proceeds. During the second quarter of 2010, three of the 61 aircraft were sold. Based on this level of increased liquidity and expected future sources of funding, including future cash flows from operations and potential aircraft sales, AIG now expects that ILFC will be able to meet its existing obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months solely from its existing cash balances, future cash flows from   107      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   operations, potential debt issuances and aircraft sales. Therefore, while AIG has acknowledged its intent to support ILFC through February 28, 2011, at the current time AIG believes that any further extension of such support will not be necessary.    •AGF anticipates that its primary sources of liquidity will be customer receivable collections, additional on-balance sheet securitizations, portfolio sales and borrowings (see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — AGF below). During the first six months of 2010, AGF significantly enhanced its liquidity position through the following actions: AGF received cash proceeds of more than $500 million from a $1.0 billion asset securitization and executed and drew down fully a $3.0 billion five-year secured term loan. AGF used a portion of the proceeds from these transactions, cash on hand and proceeds from AIG's repayment of two demand promissory notes to repay all of its outstanding obligations under its $2.45 billion one-year term loans and its $2.125 billion five-year revolving credit facility (both of which were due in July 2010). Based on this level of increased liquidity and expected future sources of funding, including future cash flows from operations, AIG now expects that AGF will be able to meet its existing obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months solely from its own future cash flows. Therefore, while AIG has acknowledged its intent to support AGF through February 28, 2011, at the current time AIG believes that any further extension of such support will not be necessary. AIG is continuing to explore strategic alternatives for AGF, including a potential sale of all or a majority of its $2.4 billion investment in AGF. Depending on the amount of proceeds to be realized on a potential sale, AIG may incur a loss, which could be material to its consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.   •Debt maturities for the Matched Investment Program (MIP) are expected to be funded through cash flows generated from invested assets, as well as the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program. However, mismatches in the timing of cash flows of the MIP, as well as any shortfalls due to impairments of MIP assets, would need to be funded by AIG Parent. In addition, as a result of AIG's restructuring activities, AIG expects to utilize assets from its noncore businesses and subsidiaries to provide future cash flow enhancement and assist the MIP in meeting its maturing debt obligations.   •Approximately $603 million of AIGFP's debt maturities through June 30, 2011 are fully collateralized, with assets backing the corresponding liabilities; however, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and AIGFP's ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.   •AIG expects to meet its debt maturities primarily through borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. The Department of the Treasury Commitment is primarily used for capital support of subsidiaries. In the future, AIG may need to provide additional capital support for its subsidiaries. AIG has developed certain plans, some of which have already been implemented, to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility. In addition, certain of AIG's outstanding financial derivative transactions could require collateral calls or termination payments based on a downgrade in AIG's credit rating. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Sales of Other Businesses   From September 2008 through July 28, 2010, AIG entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets that generated or are expected to generate approximately $23.1 billion in aggregate net proceeds, including the MetLife securities discussed above. Of this amount, $17.3 billion in aggregate net proceeds represents amounts not yet collected on various transactions, the largest of which are the ALICO, referred to above, and Nan Shan transactions. Unless a waiver is obtained from the FRBNY, net proceeds collected (or monetized, in the case of the MetLife securities) by AIG are generally required to be applied toward the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility as mandatory prepayments, except for net cash proceeds on the ALICO sale which would first be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the preferred interests owned by the FRBNY in ALICO holdings, which was approximately $9.2 billion, including accrued return, as of June 30, 2010,  108      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the FRBNY Credit Facility. Through July 28, 2010, $1.4 billion has been paid to the FRBNY under the FRBNY Credit Facility as mandatory prepayments. AIG has also made payments of approximately $3.6 billion to the FRBNY that could be determined to be mandatory prepayments in the future. Proceeds from sales of assets of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. (collectively, AIGFP) are excluded from these amounts because the FRBNY waived the requirement that the proceeds from these specific sales be applied as mandatory prepayments. Gains and losses recorded in connection with the dispositions of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment. Based on the transactions closed to date, AIG does not believe that such adjustments will be material to future consolidated results of operations or cash flows.   See Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries    AIG Parent  The following table presents AIG Parent's sources of liquidity:                            As of      (In millions)   June 30, 2010   July 28, 2010            Cash and short-term investments    $ 371    $ 409      Available borrowing under the FRBNY Credit Facility      13,251      14,380      Available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment      22,292      22,292            Total    $ 35,914    $ 37,081              AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, catastrophic losses, or a further deterioration in the super senior credit default swap portfolio may result in significant additional cash needs, or loss of some sources of liquidity, or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   Historically, AIG has depended on dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. In light of AIG's current financial situation, certain of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG. As a result, AIG has also been dependent on the FRBNY as a primary source of liquidity, and on the Department of the Treasury Commitment to support the capital needs of AIG's insurance company subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2010, AIG Parent collected $764 million in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries (primarily from insurance company subsidiaries), which included $604 million in dividends from Chartis U.S.   AIG's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding. In the first six months of 2010, AIG Parent retired $850 million of debt and made interest payments totaling $982 million, excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. AIG Parent made $2.2 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the six months ended June 30, 2010, of which the majority was contributed to AIG Capital Corporation, enabling AIG Capital Corporation to redeem its preferred securities held by a Chartis U.S. subsidiary. In addition, in the first six months of 2010, AIG Parent made net loan repayments of $800 million to AGF. At June 30, 2010, AIG Parent owes AGF $750 million under a demand note.   At the current time, AIG Parent has no access to the commercial paper market, one of its traditional sources for its short-term working capital needs. AIG is currently evaluating its ability to re-access the capital markets and expects to update and expand its well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement in the near future.   General Insurance   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. One or more large  109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  catastrophes, however, may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected General Insurance operations. In addition, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of General Insurance subsidiaries as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital.   Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's General Insurance investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. AIG's asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of AIG's General Insurance investments and the payment of claims. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments for further information.   Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations   The most significant potential liquidity needs of AIG's Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies are the funding of surrenders and withdrawals. A substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies. However, management considers the sources of liquidity for Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed income securities, in order to reduce the high levels of liquidity which had been maintained during 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from their projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. A significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, which could be triggered by a variety of factors, including AIG specific concerns, could result in a substantial liquidity strain. Other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other economic or political upheaval.   AIG believes that its Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies currently have adequate capital to support their business plans. However, to the extent that these subsidiaries experience significant future losses or declines in their investment portfolios, AIG may need to contribute capital to these companies.   Financial Services   AIG's major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of ILFC, AIGFP, AGF and AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). Certain traditional sources of funds to meet the short-term liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available. These sources included issuance of commercial paper and bank credit facilities. However, during the first six months of 2010, ILFC and AGF made significant progress in addressing their foreseeable liquidity needs, as further described below. In addition, AIG has sold a substantial portion of its consumer finance operations.   ILFC   During the first six months of 2010, ILFC refinanced five aircraft and financed five new aircraft under its ECA Facility, borrowed $1.3 billion through secured financing arrangements and issued $2.75 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in private placements.   During the second quarter of 2010, ILFC amended its bank facilities and term loans to increase its capacity to enter into secured financings to 35 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets as defined in its revolving credit facilities, which assets approximated $15.0 billion (subject to certain prepayment requirements), and extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. This agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones.  110      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  In addition, as mentioned above, ILFC agreed to sell 61 aircraft to third parties. These sales are expected to generate approximately $2.2 billion in gross proceeds during 2010. Most of the sales of the individual aircraft are expected to be consummated during the remainder of 2010 and the related proceeds are receivable upon the completion of each individual sale. As part of its ongoing fleet strategy, ILFC may pursue additional potential aircraft sales and debt issuances. ILFC management is balancing the need for funds with the long-term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives.   Because the current market for aircraft is depressed due to the economic downturn and limited availability of buyer financing, it is likely that if additional aircraft are sold to meet liquidity needs, realized losses may be incurred. In the first six months of 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment charges aggregating $387 million and operating lease related losses of $90 million on aircraft under contract to be sold.   AIG expects that ILFC's existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, potential debt issuances and aircraft sales will be sufficient for ILFC to meet its existing obligations for at least the next twelve months.       ILFC Notes and Bonds Payable   As of June 30, 2010, notes and bonds aggregating $17.4 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2017. To the extent considered appropriate, ILFC may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds.   On March 22, 2010 and April 6, 2010, ILFC issued a combined $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent senior notes due September 15, 2015, and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.750 percent senior notes due March 15, 2017. The notes are due in full on their scheduled maturity dates.   On October 13, 2009, ILFC entered into two term loan agreements (the Term Loans) with AIG Funding comprised of a new $2.0 billion credit agreement and a $1.7 billion amended and restated credit agreement. The Term Loans are secured by a portfolio of aircraft and all related equipment and leases. ILFC used the proceeds from the $2.0 billion loan to repay in full its obligations under its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility that matured on October 15, 2009. The second credit agreement amended and restated the two demand note agreements aggregating $1.7 billion that ILFC entered into in March 2009 with AIG Funding, including extending the maturity date of such demand notes. Both Term Loans mature on September 13, 2013 and currently bear interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 6.025 percent, of which 3.0 percent is permitted to be paid in kind and is added to the principal balance of the loans. The Term Loans are due in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization. On December 4, 2009, the new $2.0 billion credit agreement was increased to $2.2 billion. The funds for the Term Loans were provided to AIG Funding through the FRBNY Credit Facility. As a condition of the FRBNY approving the Term Loans, ILFC entered into agreements to guarantee the repayment of AIG's obligations under the FRBNY Credit Agreement up to an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding balance of the Term Loans.       ILFC ECA Facilities   ILFC has a $4.3 billion 1999 ECA Facility that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.81 percent to 5.86 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At June 30, 2010, ILFC had 17 loans with a remaining principal balance of $73 million outstanding under this facility. At June 30, 2010, the net book value of the related aircraft was $1.7 billion. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of an ILFC subsidiary, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility.   ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 ECA Facility, which was amended in May 2009 to allow ILFC to borrow up to a maximum of $4.6 billion to fund the purchase of Airbus aircraft delivered through June 30, 2010. This facility is also guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 2.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 4.20 percent to 4.71 percent. At June 30, 2010, ILFC had financed 76 aircraft using approximately $4.3 billion under this facility and approximately $3.0 billion was outstanding. At June 30, 2010, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 0.35 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which  111      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. At June 30, 2010, the net book value of the related aircraft was approximately $4.4 billion. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC's notes and bonds payable in the table below.   ILFC refinanced five aircraft and financed five new aircraft under the 2004 ECA Facility during the first six months of 2010. ILFC's current credit ratings require (i) the segregation of security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments received for aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts, controlled by the trustees of the 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities; and (ii) the filings of individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which the aircraft is registered. At June 30, 2010, ILFC had segregated security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments aggregating $383 million related to such aircraft. Segregated rental payments are used to pay scheduled principal and interest on the ECA facilities as they become due.   During the first quarter of 2010, ILFC entered into agreements to cross-collateralize the two ECA Facilities. In conjunction with the agreement, ILFC agreed to an acceleration event, which would accelerate debt related to the ten aircraft financed during 2010 if, among other things, ILFC were to sell aircraft with an aggregate book value exceeding an agreed upon amount, currently approximately $10.7 billion, within a period starting from the date of the agreement until December 31, 2012.       ILFC Bank Financings and Other Secured Financings   At June 30, 2010, the total funded amount of ILFC's bank financings was $4.6 billion, which includes $4.5 billion of revolving credit facilities. The fundings mature through October 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from 0.30 percent to 2.15 percent. At June 30, 2010, the interest rates ranged from 0.61 percent to 2.69 percent.   During the second quarter of 2010, ILFC amended covenants under its revolving credit facilities and bank term loans to increase its capacity to enter into secured financings from 12.5 percent to 35 percent of its consolidated tangible net assets, as defined in its credit facility agreement, which assets approximated $15.0 billion (subject to certain prepayment requirements). In conjunction with the amendment, ILFC (i) extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012 (subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones), with the loan secured by aircraft with an initial loan-to-value ratio of 75 percent, and increased the interest rate by 1.5 percent; (ii) pre-paid $410 million of bank term debt with original maturity dates through 2012; and, (iii) increased the interest rate by 1.5 percent on $75 million principal amount of bank term debt.   On March 17, 2010, ILFC entered into a $750 million term loan agreement secured by 43 aircraft and all related equipment and leases. The loan matures on March 17, 2015, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75 percent with a LIBOR floor of 2.0 percent. The principal of the loan is payable in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization, however, ILFC has the right to voluntarily prepay the loan at any time, subject to a 1.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2011. On March 17, 2010, ILFC also entered into an additional term loan agreement of $550 million. The loan is secured by 37 aircraft and all related equipment and leases. The loan matures on March 17, 2016, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 5.0 percent with a LIBOR floor of 2.0 percent. The principal of the loan is payable in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization, however, ILFC has the right to voluntarily prepay the loan at any time, subject to a 2.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2011, and a 1.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2012.   AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.   AIGFP   Prior to September 2008, AIGFP had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds, GIA borrowings, other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements.   During the second quarter of 2010, an aggregate of $2.3 billion of commercial paper of Curzon Funding LLC and Nightingale Finance LLC outstanding under the CPFF was repaid through an increase in borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility. AIGFP continues to rely on AIG Parent to meet most of its liquidity needs.  112      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP:                                  Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2009   Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty   Collateral Returned by Counterparties   Collateral Posted as of June 30, 2010     Six Months Ended June 30, 2010     (in millions)            Collateralized GIAs and other borrowings   $ 6,129   $ 414   $ 576   $ 5,967      Super senior CDS portfolio     4,590     139     719     4,010      All other derivatives     5,217     1,227     2,799     3,645            Total   $ 15,936   $ 1,780   $ 4,094   $ 13,622                  AIGFP Wind-down   AIGFP has continued unwinding its businesses and portfolios. During 2010, AIGFP reduced the notional amount of its derivative portfolio by 36 percent, from $940.7 billion (including $40.7 billion of intercompany derivatives) at December 31, 2009 to $602.4 billion (including $19.1 billion of intercompany derivatives) at June 30, 2010. AIGFP reduced the number of its outstanding trade positions by approximately 4,200, from approximately 16,100 at December 31, 2009 to approximately 11,900 at June 30, 2010. In connection with these activities, AIGFP has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate "books" and has developed a plan for addressing each book, including assessing each book's risks, risk mitigation options, monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes. Each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of AIG. The plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve, and they contemplate, depending on the book in question, alternative strategies, including sales, assignments or other transfers of positions, terminations of positions, and/or run-offs of positions in accordance with existing terms. Execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving senior members of AIGFP's and AIG's respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences. Successful execution of these plans is subject, to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book, to market conditions and, in many circumstances, counterparty negotiation and agreement.   In connection with the wind-down, certain assets were sold. The proceeds from these sales have been used to fund AIGFP's wind-down and are not included in the amounts described above under AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due. The FRBNY waived the requirement under the FRBNY Credit Agreement that the proceeds of these specific sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the FRBNY Credit Facility, which would have resulted in a permanent reduction of the FRBNY's commitment to lend to AIG. Instead, the FRBNY has given AIGFP permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales, and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the FRBNY Credit Facility, with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the FRBNY Credit Facility. AIGFP is also opportunistically terminating contracts.   As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses. AIGFP has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio, including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in connection with ML III and through the ongoing termination of transactions in its regulatory capital portfolio, a sale of its commodity index business, termination and sale of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker, and sale and other disposition of its energy/infrastructure investment portfolio. AIGFP also has novated certain trades to AIG Markets. Due to the long-term duration of AIGFP's derivative contracts and the complexity of AIGFP's portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios will take a substantial period of time.   During the second quarter of 2010, AIG continued to make progress winding down AIGFP's derivatives portfolio. At June, 30, 2010, the portfolio was $602.4 billion, of which $89.5 billion were super senior credit default swap contracts. AIG expects to continue to reduce the size of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio through the  113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  remainder of the year. If the wind-down continues as anticipated, AIG expects late in 2010 or early 2011 that the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio will consist of transactions that AIG believes will be of low complexity or of low risk or not economically feasible to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. During the latter stages of the wind-down, AIG expects to assume direct management of the investments and debt obligations of AIGFP, at which time the performance of those assets and liabilities will no longer be reported as part of Capital Markets. However, AIG anticipates that the remaining derivatives business will continue to be reported as Capital Markets.   The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades. In addition, the Determination Memoranda issued by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation place significant new restrictions on the compensation of AIGFP employees included in the five executives named in AIG's Proxy Statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of AIG (Top 25) and AIG's next 75 most highly compensated employees and executive officers (together, the Top 100) and may impair AIGFP's ability to retain these employees, and consequently negatively impact the wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios.   AGF   Prior to September 2008, AGF's traditional source of liquidity had been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets.   AGF anticipates that its primary sources of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections, additional on-balance sheet securitizations, portfolio sales and other borrowings. In order to improve cash flow from operations, AGF has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses. Since year end 2009, AGF has continued to manage its liquidity with proceeds of more than $500 million from a $1.0 billion asset securitization in March 2010 and the execution and full drawdown of a $3.0 billion five-year secured term loan in April 2010. AIG is continuing to explore strategic alternatives for AGF, including a potential sale of all or a majority of its $2.4 billion investment in AGF. Depending on the amount of proceeds to be realized on a potential sale, AIG may incur a loss, which could be material to its consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. In January 2010, AIG made an $11 million capital contribution to AGF (through AIG Capital Corporation). In March 2010, AGF repaid the $2.45 billion one-year term loans and in April 2010, AGF repaid the $2.125 billion revolving credit facility, both prior to their due dates in July 2010. AIG manages its liquidity on a consolidated basis, which may include making or receiving short-term loans with AGF.   AGF Notes and Bonds Payable   As of June 30, 2010, notes and bonds payable aggregating $17.0 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from 0.72 percent to 9.00 percent. To the extent considered appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF.  114                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Debt   The following table provides the rollforward of AIG's total debt outstanding:                                            Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 (in millions)   Balance at December 31, 2009   Issuances   Maturities and Repayments   Effect of Foreign Exchange   Other Non-Cash Changes(a)   Activity of discontinued operations   Reclassified to Liabilities of businesses held for sale   Balance at June 30, 2010            Debt issued by AIG:                                                        FRBNY Credit Facility    $ 23,435   $ 12,700   $ (10,123 ) $ -   $ 445   $ -   $ -    $ 26,457        Notes and bonds payable      10,419     -     (850 )   (214 )   29     -     -      9,384        Junior subordinated debt      12,001     -     -     (559 )   -     -     -      11,442        Junior subordinated debt attributable to equity units      5,880     -     -     -     -     -     -      5,880        Loans and mortgages payable      438     -     -     (18 )   2     -     -      422        MIP matched notes and bonds payable      13,371     -     (500 )   (410 )   (117 )   -     -      12,344        Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable      3,913     -     (55 )   -     122     -     -      3,980              Total AIG debt      69,457     12,700     (11,528 )   (1,201 )   481     -     -      69,909            Debt guaranteed by AIG:                                                      AIGFP, at fair value(b):                                                        FRBNY commercial paper funding facility      2,742     2,272     (6,127 )   -     1,113     -     -      -        GIAs      8,257     292     (801 )   -     1,118     -     -      8,866        Notes and bonds payable      2,029     27     (316 )   -     (26 )   -     -      1,714        Loans and mortgages payable      1,022     21     (283 )   -     (128 )   -     -      632        Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      1,887     -     (179 )   -     (283 )   -     -      1,425              Total AIGFP debt      15,937     2,612     (7,706 )   -     1,794     -     -      12,637            AIG Funding – FRBNY commercial paper                                                        funding facility      1,997     -     (2,000 )   -     3     -     -      -            AIGLH notes and bonds payable      798     -     -     -     -     -     -      798            Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock      1,339     -     -     -     -     -     -      1,339            Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG      89,528     15,312     (21,234 )   (1,201 )   2,278     -     -      84,683            Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                                      ILFC:                                                        Notes and bonds payable, ECA facilities, bank financings and other secured financings(c)      25,174     4,316     (2,638 )   (335 )   5     -     -      26,522        Junior subordinated debt      999     -     -     -     -     -     -      999              Total ILFC debt      26,173     4,316     (2,638 )   (335 )   5     -     -      27,521            AGF:                                                        Notes and bonds payable      19,770     3,501     (6,070 )   (256 )   31     -     -      16,976        Junior subordinated debt      349     -     -     -     -     -     -      349              Total AGF debt      20,119     3,501     (6,070 )   (256 )   31     -     -      17,325            AIGCFG loans and mortgages payable      216     99     (96 )   (10 )   (166 )   -     -      43            Other subsidiaries      295     14     (11 )   (7 )   164     -     (3 )    452            Total debt of consolidated investments(d)      5,141     113     (1,135 )   (34 )   724     (28 )   (62 )    4,719            Total debt not guaranteed by AIG      51,944     8,043     (9,950 )   (642 )   758     (28 )   (65 )    50,060            Total debt:                                                        Total long-term debt      136,733     21,083     (23,057 )   (1,843 )   1,920     (28 )   (65 )    134,743        FRBNY commercial paper funding facility      4,739     2,272     (8,127 )   -     1,116     -     -      -            Total debt    $ 141,472   $ 23,355   $ (31,184 ) $ (1,843 ) $ 3,036   $ (28 ) $ (65 )  $ 134,743               (a) FRBNY Credit Facility reflects $445 million of accrued compounding interest and fees.

Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of July 30, 2010. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the  116      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(c) Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.  (d) Stable Outlook.  (e) Negative Outlook.  (f) Evolving Outlook.  (g) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding.   These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of AIGFP's GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require AIGFP, upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings, to post collateral or, with the consent of the counterparties, assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effect of a downgrade in AIG's credit ratings on AIGFP's financial derivative transactions, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  117      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                            Payments due by Period      At June 30, 2010 (in millions)   Total Payments   Remainder of 2010   2011 - 2012   2013 - 2014   2015   Thereafter            Borrowings   $ 103,567   $ 8,720   $ 25,209   $ 12,260   $ 8,406   $ 48,972      FRBNY Credit Facility     26,457     -     -     26,457     -     -      Interest payments on borrowings     61,497     2,239     9,325     10,596     3,223     36,114      Loss reserves     85,604     10,444     27,564     15,195     4,965     27,436      Insurance and investment contract liabilities     673,041     18,220     39,342     47,825     22,022     545,632      GIC liabilities     8,806     219     2,531     2,463     264     3,329      Aircraft purchase commitments     13,502     -     887     2,926     1,568     8,121      Other long-term obligations(a)     545     166     178     82     8     111            Total(b)   $ 973,019   $ 40,008   $ 105,036   $ 117,804   $ 40,456   $ 669,715             (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.  (b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.7 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of AIGFP's credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At June 30, 2010, the fair value derivative liability was $3.8 billion relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, net of amounts realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at June 30, 2010, AIGFP had posted collateral of $3.2 billion with respect to these swaps (prior to offsets for other transactions).  Additional information regarding AIG's contractual obligations follows:   Borrowings   Excludes borrowings incurred by consolidated investments and includes hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. The repayment of long-term debt maturities, net borrowings under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG and its subsidiaries are expected to be made through maturing investments and asset sales, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements, as more fully described in AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due above.   Loss Reserves   Loss reserves relate primarily to General Insurance business and represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by the individual General Insurance subsidiaries to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. The General Insurance subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $13.0 billion as of June 30, 2010. Further, General Insurance businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein), which could be monetized in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, management believes there are generally sufficient resources within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual needs. See Capital Resources and Liquidity — Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries for matters that could affect operating cash flows and liquidity of the subsidiaries.  118      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities   GIC liabilities represent guaranteed maturities under GICs. Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate primarily to Life Insurance and Retirement Services businesses and include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of AIG's control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management believes that adequate financial resources are maintained by individual Life Insurance and Retirement Services subsidiaries to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $19.1 billion as of June 30, 2010. In addition, the Life Insurance and Retirement Services businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds (see Investments herein), which may be monetized in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, management believes there are generally sufficient resources within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual needs. Liquidity needs for GIC liabilities are generally expected to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.   Aircraft Purchases   At June 30, 2010, ILFC has committed to purchase 115 new aircraft deliverable from 2011 through 2019, at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $13.5 billion, the majority of which is due after 2015, with $248 million coming due through 2011.

(b)Primarily represents SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. (c)Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnifications included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (d)Includes commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in limited partnerships and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate businesses. (e)Includes options to acquire aircraft. Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2010 is expected to be approximately $52 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (f)Does not include guarantees or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.   Securities Financing   The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.   See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends.       Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities    While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  120                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Results of Operations    AIG reports the results of its operations through four reportable segments: General Insurance, Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, and Financial Services. Through these reportable segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG's Other operations category consists of business and items not allocated to AIG's reportable segments. AIG's subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG's Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad.

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, Premiums and other considerations decreased by $3.4 billion compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of the aforementioned dispositions as well as the sale of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) in the first quarter of 2009. Additionally, Commercial Insurance premiums declined by approximately $1.0 billion compared to the first six months of 2009 due to the continued unfavorable pricing environment and weak economy. The decline also reflects price discipline in workers' compensation and capital management initiatives.       Net Investment Income   The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income:                                         Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Fixed maturities, including short-term investments    $ 3,924    $ 3,879      1 %  $ 7,810    $ 8,123      (4 )%    Maiden Lane interests      478      895      (47 )    1,389      (1,288 )    -      Equity securities      112      111      1      167      194      (14 )    Interest on mortgage and other loans      127      146      (13 )    271      305      (11 )    Partnerships      433      (66 )    -      819      (858 )    -      Mutual funds      (1 )    245      -      26      163      (84 )    Real estate      258      243      6      510      504      1      Other investments      221      230      4      295      288      2            Total investment income before policyholder income and trading gains (losses)      5,552      5,683      (2 )    11,287      7,431      52      Policyholder investment income and trading gains (losses)      (2 )    1,307      -      (72 )    1,235      -            Total investment income      5,550      6,990      (21 )    11,215      8,666      29      Investment expenses      164      132      24      284      334      (15 )          Net investment income    $ 5,386    $ 6,858      (21 )%  $ 10,931    $ 8,332      31 %            Net investment income declined in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a decline in Policyholder investment income and trading gains for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services (together, policyholder trading gains) compared to 2009. Policyholder trading gains are offset by a change in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets. This decline also reflected lower valuation gains associated with AIG's interest in ML II and ML III. These declines were partially offset by income from partnership investments in 2010 compared to losses in 2009, reflecting improved market conditions in the current year period.   Net investment income increased in six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to significantly higher income from partnership investments and increased valuation gains associated with AIG's interest in ML II and ML III. These increases were partially offset by the decline in Policyholder trading gains noted above.   Both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 reflected lower levels of invested assets, including the effect of divested businesses, as well as lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments that were held for liquidity purposes.  122      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)                                     Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Sales of fixed maturity securities    $ 165    $ 391    $ 499    $ 413      Sales of equity securities      68      91      272      46      Sales of real estate and loans      45      (20 )    35      (17 )    Other-than-temporary impairments:                                Severity      (25 )    (14 )    (79 )    (1,682 )      Change in intent      (27 )    (128 )    (55 )    (863 )      Foreign currency declines      (32 )    (142 )    (64 )    (226 )      Issuer-specific credit events      (568 )    (575 )    (1,536 )    (1,695 )      Adverse projected cash flows on structured securities      -      (3 )    -      (136 )    Provision for loan losses      (88 )    (155 )    (213 )    (572 )    Foreign exchange transactions      772      (1,057 )    1,393      (781 )    Derivative instruments      (893 )    598      (1,327 )    1,629      Other      (35 )    (117 )    16      4            Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)    $ (618 )  $ (1,131 )  $ (1,059 )  $ (3,880 )            Net realized capital losses decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009 reflecting lower other-than-temporary impairment charges in the current year periods. Affecting the six-month comparison was the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard commencing in the second quarter of 2009. The three-month period ended March 31, 2009 included non-credit impairments (i.e. severity losses) that are no longer required for fixed maturity securities. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Investments — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. The three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 also included increased foreign exchange transaction gains. Partially offsetting the above items were losses on derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, primarily resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates and a tightening of credit spreads.       Unrealized Market Valuation Gains (Losses) on AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio    AIGFP reported a decline in unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of increased corporate spreads in the corporate arbitrage portfolio partially offset by improved prices of the underlying assets in the multi-sector CDO portfolio.   The unrealized market valuation gains increased $96 million, to $280 million, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of improved prices of the underlying assets in the multi-sector CDO portfolio partially offset by losses in the corporate arbitrage portfolio caused by increasing corporate spreads.

Other Income    Other income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to a decline of $1.1 billion reflecting the negative effect of derivative hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting.  123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Other income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to:   •a decline of $1.7 billion reflecting the negative effect of derivative hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting;   •a decline of $1.3 billion in net credit valuation adjustment gains on AIGFP's assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value, excluding gains and losses which are reflected in Unrealized gains (losses) on AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio, partially offset by reduced losses from Capital Markets from lower unwind costs and lower unrealized market valuation losses; and   •lower aircraft leasing revenues resulting from an increase of $391 million in ILFC aircraft asset impairment charges and an increase of $90 million in operating lease-related charges with respect to aircraft sold, otherwise disposed of or held for sale.   This decrease was partially offset by a bargain purchase gain of $406 million related to the Fuji acquisition.       Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred    Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 due to:   •a reduction of $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2009 as a result of the aforementioned dispositions in 2009;   •a decrease in incurred policy losses and benefit expenses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services due to a decline in policyholder trading gains of $1.3 billion for both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 discussed above in Net Investment Income;   •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expense for Mortgage Guaranty operations primarily due to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies; and   •the effects of lower production levels for General Insurance and Domestic Life & Retirement Services.   Partially offsetting these declines were increased catastrophe losses for General Insurance. See General Insurance results herein for further discussion.       Policy Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses    Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to reductions of $315 million and $683 million, respectively, as a result of the aforementioned dispositions in 2009.   Partially offsetting this decrease in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 were the effects of $222 million of amortization of a premium deficiency reserve by UGC in the first quarter of 2009.       Interest Expense    Interest expense decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to lower interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility benefited from a reduced weighted average interest rate of 3.3 percent for both the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 compared to 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent for the same periods in 2009. Interest expense also benefited from a lower average outstanding balance in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 of $23.8 billion and $22.9 billion compared to $43.2 billion and $41.4 billion in the same periods of 2009. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $755 million and $1.6 billion in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to $1.4 billion and $2.9 billion in the same periods in 2009. Interest expense in three- and  124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 included $543 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset associated with the FRBNY Credit Facility compared to $822 million and $1.6 billion in the same periods of 2009.       Restructuring Expenses and Related Asset Impairment and Other Expenses    Restructuring expenses decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 reflecting progress made under the restructuring plan and asset disposition initiatives. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses.       Net (Gain) Loss on Sale of Divested Businesses    Net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses includes the net gain (loss) on the sale of divested businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations as well as a gain of $228 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 associated with the termination fee paid by Prudential to AIG compared to losses in the comparable periods of 2009. See Segment Results — Other Operations — Other Results herein for further information.       Other Expenses    Other expenses decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 due to a decline in the Consumer Finance provision for loan losses of $283 million and $537 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively. The decrease also reflected lower compensation and other costs for the noncore Asset Management businesses reflecting the effect of the deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of its investment advisory and third party institutional asset management business in the third quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in corporate unallocated costs reflecting an increased securities litigation charge.       Income Tax Benefits    For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, the effective tax rates on pre-tax income from continuing operations were 19.4 percent and (3.3) percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to an increase in the valuation allowance of $539 million, partially offset by tax exempt interest of $152 million and the effect of foreign operations of $501 million. The effective tax rate for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 was negative because AIG recorded a net tax benefit on pre-tax income. The benefit reflected in the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to the effects of tax exempt interest income of $307 million, the effect of foreign operations of $467 million, the excess amount of the Fuji bargain purchase gain for financial reporting over the tax basis which is essentially permanent in duration of $142 million, and a reduction of $211 million in the valuation allowance.   In making its determination of the fair values of the subsidiaries to be divested, AIG considered, among other information, valuations prepared for various purposes by third parties and updated by AIG, when necessary. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2010 AIG and Prudential plc terminated the AIA transaction. Because AIG is still proceeding with its plans to divest AIA, this termination has not affected the amount of deferred tax assets expected to be realized in connection with the planned divestiture of AIA. This determination was based on an assessment of the expected gain resulting from a range of possible outcomes associated with alternative divestiture strategies, including an initial public offering.   For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009, the effective tax rates on pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations were (242.7) percent and 20.9 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 was negative because AIG recorded a tax benefit on pre-tax income. The benefit reflected in the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 was primarily related to a decrease in the valuation allowance of $1.6 billion, partially offset by  125      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  deferred tax expense of $760 million mainly attributable to the change in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries and an increase of $382 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions. The benefit reflected in the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was primarily related to tax exempt interest of $366 million, partially offset by changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries of $287 million and an increase of $406 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions.   At June 30, 2010 AIG's net deferred tax asset was comprised of $7.1 billion (net of $20.8 billion valuation allowance) related to its U.S. consolidated income tax group, and $1.6 billion of net deferred tax liability related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. AIG assesses its ability to realize the deferred tax asset based on AIG's ability to generate gains on asset sales, including from the divestitures of AIA and ALICO, and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset. This assessment does not depend on projected future operating income of the U.S. consolidated income tax group.   In any interim period, the U.S. consolidated income tax group may generate income or loss. To the extent that any income is generated, the related tax expense may be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. Conversely, any tax benefits arising from losses may be offset by an additional valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Any reduction of the valuation allowance will be allocated to continuing operations, discontinued operations and components of shareholders' equity based on the intraperiod tax allocation rules. AIG's foreign subsidiaries and U.S. subsidiaries filing separate returns will continue to recognize tax expense and tax benefits, based on their income or loss, which will be reflected in AIG's consolidated income tax provision (benefit).   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Discontinued Operations   The composition of total revenues and pre-tax income (loss) for results reported as discontinued operations were as follows:                                         Total Revenues         Pre-tax Income (Loss)              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     Three Months Ended June 30, (in millions)       2010   2009   2010   2009            ALICO(a)    $ 3,439    $ 3,820      (10 )%  $ (2,862 )  $ 396      - %    Nan Shan      1,761      2,348      (25 )    (325 )    799      -      Interest allocation(b)      -      -      -      (41 )    (47 )    -            Total    $ 5,200    $ 6,168      (16 )%  $ (3,228 )  $ 1,148      - %          Six Months Ended June 30,                                          ALICO(a)    $ 6,961    $ 6,281      11 %  $ (2,319 )  $ 571      - %    Nan Shan      3,904      3,986      (2 )    (307 )    641      -      Interest allocation(b)      -      -      -      (82 )    (102 )    -            Total    $ 10,865    $ 10,267      6 %  $ (2,708 )  $ 1,110      - %           (a) ALICO's pre-tax loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 includes the impairment of $3.3 billion of goodwill that had been allocated to ALICO as a consequence of ALICO's removal from the Japan and Other operating segment. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Goodwill impairment for further discussion. (b)Represents interest expense, including periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset, on the estimated $1.825 billion of the FRBNY Credit Facility required to be repaid as a result of the net proceeds to be received from the expected sale of Nan Shan. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  126      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       ALICO Results    ALICO total revenues declined for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to lower policyholder trading gains, which are offset in policyholder benefits and claims incurred. This decline more than offset growth in Premiums and other considerations of 3 percent compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting the positive impact of foreign exchange. Total revenues also benefited from a decline in realized capital losses due to foreign exchange transaction gains in the current year period. ALICO's pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 was largely due to the impairment of goodwill discussed above.   ALICO total revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 increased over the same period in 2009 reflecting a decline of $494 million in net realized capital losses due to foreign exchange transaction gains in the current year period as well as growth of 5 percent in Premiums and other considerations compared to the same period in 2009 due to the positive impact of foreign exchange and continued strength in new and renewal business. ALICO's pre-tax loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 was largely due to the impairment of goodwill discussed above.       Nan Shan Results    Nan Shan total revenues decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to net realized capital losses of $66 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to net realized capital gains of $720 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. The net realized capital gains in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 resulted primarily from gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities, which more than offset the 2010 increase in premiums and other considerations resulting from growth in the business and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. Included in Nan Shan's pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 is a $294 million additional loss accrual associated with the contingent sales consideration related to the escrow of funds on the sale of Nan Shan. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.   Nan Shan total revenues decreased slightly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as the decline in net realized capital gains was largely offset by increased premiums and other considerations resulting from growth in the business and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The pre-tax loss reflects the change in net realized capital gains and the $294 million loss discussed above.       Segment Results   AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. In managing its businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business based on pre-tax income (loss), excluding net realized capital gains (losses), results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses, because AIG believes that this permits better assessment and enhances understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.  127                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment.

As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its financial statement users. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business AIG uses underwriting profit (loss) to assess performance of the General Insurance business rather than statutory underwriting profit (loss).   Commercial Insurance writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Commercial Insurance the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Commercial Insurance without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit Commercial Insurance to accept a risk.   AIG's Foreign General insurance group writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of branches and foreign based insurance subsidiaries. Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. Foreign General insurance group operates in Asia & the Pacific, Europe, the Far East and Emerging Markets.  128      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      General Insurance Results   The following table presents General Insurance results:                                          Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Underwriting results:                                            Net premiums written    $ 7,792    $ 7,919      (2 )%  $ 15,436    $ 15,652      (1 )%      Decrease (increase) in unearned premiums      (59 )    98      -      (62 )    643      -              Net premiums earned      7,733      8,017      (4 )    15,374      16,295      (6 )      Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred      5,575      5,638      (1 )    11,034      11,427      (3 )      Change in deferred acquisition costs      (104 )    15      -      (122 )    20      -        Other underwriting expenses      2,420      2,219      9      4,812      4,426      9            Underwriting profit (loss)      (158 )    145      -      (350 )    422      -            Investing and other results:                                            Net investment income      1,113      869      28      2,184      1,304      67        Net realized capital gains (losses)      58      (37 )    -      195      (645 )    -        Bargain purchase gain      -      -      -      406      -      -            Pre-tax income    $ 1,013    $ 977      4 %  $ 2,435    $ 1,081      125 %            General Insurance Underwriting Results   In managing its general insurance businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of its businesses using underwriting profit. Underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses, including the change in deferred acquisition costs.   AIG, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the cost of claims and expenses, respectively. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.   Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period.   The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio.   General Insurance Net Premiums Written   General Insurance net premiums written in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 declined 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2009, reflecting General Insurance's risk management initiatives and continued price discipline in lines where market rates are unsatisfactory. This decline was partially offset by a positive effect from foreign exchange and strategic growth in higher margin lines of business. While General Insurance continues to see improved premium and account retention, new business submissions, and a relatively stable rate environment, net premium writings continue to be adversely affected by a weak economic environment.  129      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies.

General Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table summarizes General Insurance GAAP combined ratios:                                  Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,          2010   2009   2010   2009            Loss ratio      72.1      70.3      71.8      70.1      Expense ratio      29.9      27.9      30.5      27.3            Combined ratio      102.0      98.2      102.3      97.4                    Quarterly Underwriting Ratios   The increase in the General Insurance combined ratio for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •a loss ratio for accident year 2010 recorded in 2010 which was 1.9 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2009. This increase is from $287 million in catastrophe losses, including floods in the Southeastern United States, Hurricane Alex, U.S. hailstorms, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, and the Icelandic volcano, in total accounting for a 3.7 point increase in the current accident year loss ratio;   •the loss ratio also includes prior year development, which amounted to $95 million of net adverse development for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to net adverse development of $60 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009. This is primarily attributable to favorable development in Commercial Insurance's Lexington lines of business being more than offset by adverse development in asbestos, professional liability and specialty workers' compensation businesses and reinsurance commutations. The prior period includes $71 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies for Commercial Insurance, which has no effect on underwriting profit as the amounts are entirely offset by a decline in earned premiums;   •an increase of 2.0 points in the expense ratio primarily due to a decrease in earned premium, an increase in policy acquisition costs and general operating expenses. The increase in policy acquisition costs was largely due to changes in the mix of business as General Insurance focuses on product lines consistent with its risk appetite and capital management targets. The 2009 period also includes a reduction for the commutation of reinsurance agreements which increased ceding commissions and reduced overall policy acquisition expenses. The increase in general operating expenses was due to various long-term compensation programs that were put in place in the second half of 2009 targeting multi-year objectives and therefore no expenses were accrued in the first six months of 2009. Operational enhancement initiatives, including the implementation of financial systems, an improved control environment, and costs associated with securing financial strength ratings for certain of its operating subsidiaries also increased in the current period.  130      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Year-to-Date Underwriting Ratios   The increase in the General Insurance combined ratio for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 primarily resulted from:   •a loss ratio for accident year 2010 which was 4.5 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2009. This increase is due to approximately $768 million in catastrophe losses driven by the earthquake in Chile, flooding in the Southeastern United States, two severe windstorms in the Northeastern United States, flooding in Madeira (Portugal), U.S. hailstorms, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, the Icelandic volcano, and Hurricane Alex, in total accounting for a 4.9 point increase in the accident year loss ratio; and   •an increase of 3.2 points in the expense ratio primarily due to a decrease in earned premium, an increase in policy acquisition costs and general operating expenses, and the reduction for the commutation of reinsurance agreements in 2009 which increased ceding commissions and reduced overall policy acquisition expenses, all of which are discussed in quarterly results above.   Partially offsetting these increases was favorable prior year development, which amounted to $149 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to adverse development of $232 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. This is primarily attributable to favorable development in Commercial Insurance's Lexington lines of business, partially offset by adverse development in asbestos, professional liability, and specialty workers' compensation businesses and reinsurance commutations. Foreign General Insurance also experienced favorable development, primarily in its directors & officers' liability (D&O) lines. The current year includes $59 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies for Commercial Insurance compared to $172 million in 2009.   Quarterly General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Net investment income for General Insurance increased primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments. Net realized capital gains were recognized in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 primarily due to increased gains in derivatives and positive effects of foreign exchange.   Year-to-Date General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Net investment income for General Insurance increased primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments. Net realized capital gains were recognized in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments, higher gains on sales of fixed maturities and the positive effect of foreign exchange. The Fuji acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $406 million, which is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in Other Income.

In addition, limited capital for new projects reduced the demand for general liability and commercial umbrella insurance.       Commercial Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents Commercial Insurance GAAP combined ratios:                                  Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,          2010   2009   2010   2009            Loss ratio      82.2      79.8      79.2      79.1      Expense ratio      24.3      20.0      25.3      21.1            Combined ratio      106.5      99.8      104.5      100.2              The increase in the Commercial Insurance combined ratio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •an accident year loss ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2010 that was 2.8 points higher than the accident year loss ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2009, resulting from an increase in catastrophe-related losses of $223 million primarily attributable to flooding in the Southeastern United States and the effects of premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends; and   •an increase in the expense ratio of 4.3 points driven by a decrease in earned premium, an increase in policy acquisition costs and general operating expenses and the reduction for the commutation of reinsurance agreements in 2009 which increased ceding commissions and reduced overall policy acquisition expenses, all of which are discussed in General Insurance results above.   These increases were compounded by an increase in adverse prior-year development. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, Commercial Insurance recorded adverse development of $90 million compared to adverse development of $62 million in the same period of 2009. The adverse development for 2009 includes $71 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies.   The increase in the Commercial Insurance combined ratio in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •an accident year loss ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2010 that was 4.2 points higher than the accident year loss ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2009, resulting from an increase in catastrophe-related losses of approximately $400 million attributable to the combined losses of two severe windstorms in the Northeastern United States, flooding in the Southeastern United States, the earthquake in Chile, U.S. hailstorms, and Hurricane Alex; and   •an increase in the expense ratio of 4.2 points driven by a decrease in earned premium, an increase in policy acquisition costs and general operating expenses, and the reduction for the commutation of reinsurance agreements in 2009 which increased ceding commissions and reduced overall policy acquisition expenses discussed in General Insurance results above.   These increases were partially offset by a change in prior-year development. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, Commercial Insurance recorded favorable development of $100 million compared to adverse development of $226 million in the same period of 2009. The net favorable development for 2010 includes  133      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  $59 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies compared to $172 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies in the same period in 2009.       Quarterly Commercial Insurance Net Loss Development   The $90 million of adverse development in the three months ended June 30, 2010 is primarily attributable to adverse development of $56 million related to reinsurance commutations, $55 million in the professional liability business, $40 million related to asbestos & environmental claims, and $38 million in the specialty workers' compensation line of business. These losses were partially offset by $127 million of favorable development in the Lexington lines of business. Excess casualty and excess workers' compensation showed no development in the quarter.       Year-to-Date Commercial Insurance Net Loss Development   The $100 million of favorable development in the six months ended June 30, 2010 is primarily attributable to favorable development in the Lexington lines of business partially offset by $56 million adverse development related to reinsurance commutations, $46 million of adverse development in the professional liability business, and $40 million of adverse development related to asbestos and environmental claims. Excess casualty and excess workers' compensation showed no development to date in 2010.   Quarterly Commercial Insurance Investing Results   Net investment income for Commercial Insurance increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments of $255 million.   Net realized capital losses of $61 million for Commercial Insurance in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 decreased from net realized capital losses of $82 million in the same period of 2009 primarily due to higher gains from derivatives and a decline in other-than-temporary impairments on investments, partially offset by lower gains from sales of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and real estate.   Year-to-Date Commercial Insurance Investing Results   Net investment income for Commercial Insurance increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to improvement in returns from partnership investments.   Net realized capital losses for Commercial Insurance declined in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments and higher gains from derivatives.

From a regional perspective, real growth in the Far East region was slightly down while positive growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region contributed to the continuing upward trend in production since the third quarter of 2009, which is attributable to improved retention and strong new business submissions.  135      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Net Premiums Written   Foreign General Insurance net premiums written increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to:   •positive effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, which contributed 5.0 percent to the increase; and   •new business as global economic conditions improved.   From a regional perspective, Europe achieved significant growth particularly in the critical first quarter renewal season. In addition, positive growth in the Asia-Pacific regions and Emerging Markets contributed to the continuing upward trend in production since the third quarter of 2009, which is attributable to improved retention and strong new business submissions.

Catastrophe losses included losses due to the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, the Icelandic volcano and Hurricane Alex; and   •a 2.5 point decrease to the expense ratio due to lower acquisition and other costs attributable to new and renewal business partially offset by costs associated with securing financial strength ratings for certain of its operating subsidiaries and various long-term compensation programs. The various long-term compensation programs were put in place in the second half of 2009 targeting multi-year objectives and therefore no expenses were accrued in the first six months of 2009.   The increase in the Foreign General Insurance combined ratio in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily resulted from the following:   •significant catastrophe-related losses in the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to none in the six months ended June 30, 2009, contributed 5.7 points to the loss ratio. Catastrophe losses included the earthquake in Chile, flooding in Madeira (Portugal), the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, the Icelandic volcano, and Hurricane Alex; and  136      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  •an increase to the expense ratio of 0.5 points due to costs associated with securing financial strength ratings for certain of its operating subsidiaries, other operational enhancements and various long-term compensation programs partially offset by lower acquisition and other costs attributable to new and renewal business. The various long-term compensation programs were put in place in the second half of 2009 targeting multi-year objectives and therefore no expenses were accrued in the first six months of 2009.       Quarterly Foreign General Insurance Net Loss Development   Foreign General Insurance experienced $5 million of net adverse development in the three months ended June 30, 2010, including $21 million of favorable development from the excess casualty line of business partially offset by $13 million of adverse development in the D&O line of business. The remainder was spread throughout the other lines of business.       Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Net Loss Development   Foreign General Insurance experienced $49 million of favorable development in the six months ended June 30, 2010, including $21 million of favorable development from the excess casualty line of business and $15 million of favorable development from the D&O line of business. The remainder was spread throughout the other lines of business.   Quarterly Foreign General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Foreign General Insurance net investment income remained relatively flat in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to higher interest income and partnership results partially offset by lower mutual fund income.   Foreign General Insurance recorded net realized capital gains in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 due to gains in the sales of fixed maturity securities and the favorable effect of foreign exchange.   Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Investing and Other Results   Foreign General Insurance net investment income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to higher partnership results partially offset by lower mutual fund, interest and dividend income.   Foreign General Insurance recorded net realized capital gains in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 due to gains in the sales of fixed maturity securities, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower other-than-temporary impairments on investments.   On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Foreign General Insurance subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji. The acquisition of the additional voting shares for $145 million increased Foreign General Insurance's total voting ownership interest in Fuji from 41.7 percent to 54.8 percent, which resulted in Foreign General Insurance obtaining control of Fuji.   Because the acquisition was completed on the last day of the quarter, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when AIG issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The initial purchase price allocation was based on the information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests of Fuji as of the acquisition date. Fuji's financial information is reported to Foreign General Insurance on a quarter lag. As such, Foreign General Insurance was awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date. Furthermore, at the time, Foreign General Insurance had not obtained final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate and intangible assets.   During the quarter ended June 30, 2010, Foreign General Insurance completed the accounting for the acquisition and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded. Foreign General Insurance  137      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  obtained the additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date including final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate or intangible assets. Adjustments to the revised purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2010 may occur if new information becomes known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date.   The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $406 million, which is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in Other Income. AIG will retrospectively revise its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 when presenting comparative financial information containing that period. The bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of Fuji's common stock, which AIG believes is the result of macro-economic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fuji's financial condition and results of operations. AIG anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the Fuji shares.       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense    The following discussion on the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for the Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance reporting units in the General Insurance operating segment and loss reserves pertaining to divested and/or Noncore businesses and those of the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit collectively reported in AIG's Other category.

The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  The following table classifies the components of the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense by business unit:                         (in millions)   June 30, 2010   December 31, 2009            General Insurance segment:                    Commercial Insurance    $ 49,891    $ 50,498        Foreign General Insurance      13,493      12,688            Total General Insurance      63,384      63,186              Mortgage Guaranty      4,039      4,713            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 67,423    $ 67,899              Discounting of Reserves   At June 30, 2010, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.66 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. The discount is comprised of the following: $669 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance and $1.99 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance.   Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that the net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of June 30, 2010. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of June 30, 2010. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves:                                   Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 68,549    $ 72,254    $ 67,899    $ 72,455      Foreign exchange effect      (662 )    1,080      (1,215 )    790      Acquisitions      -      -      1,538 (a)    -      Dispositions      (59 )    (7,551 )    (84 )    (7,838 )(b)          Losses and loss expenses incurred:(c)                                Current year      5,539      6,931      11,537      14,795        Prior years, other than accretion of discount      (137 )    272      (613 )    336        Prior years, accretion of discount      86      98      172      196            Losses and loss expenses incurred      5,488      7,301      11,096      15,327            Losses and loss expenses paid(c)      5,893      7,314      11,809      14,964            Reclassified (from) to liabilities held for sale      -      -      (2 )    -            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 67,423    $ 65,770    $ 67,423    $ 65,770               (a) Represents the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for three-month period ended June 30, 2010. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   See General Insurance Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.   As described more fully in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the table that follows. This development was primarily attributable to several large accounts. In addition, a minor adjustment to the environmental gross and net reserves was also recognized.  141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined:                                   2010   2009      Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)       Gross   Net   Gross   Net            Asbestos:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 3,236    $ 1,151    $ 3,443    $ 1,200        Dispositions      -      -      (26 )    (21 )      Losses and loss expenses incurred*      99      38      120      50        Losses and loss expenses paid*      (358 )    (114 )    (295 )    (77 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 2,977    $ 1,075    $ 3,242    $ 1,152            Environmental:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 338    $ 159    $ 417    $ 194        Dispositions      -      -      -      (7 )      Losses and loss expenses incurred*      8      11      2      (1 )      Losses and loss expenses paid*      (35 )    (17 )    (29 )    (16 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 311    $ 153    $ 390    $ 170            Combined:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 3,574    $ 1,310    $ 3,860    $ 1,394        Dispositions      -      -      (26 )    (28 )      Losses and loss expenses incurred*      107      49      122      49        Losses and loss expenses paid*      (393 )    (131 )    (324 )    (93 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 3,288    $ 1,228    $ 3,632    $ 1,322               * All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years, primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior years.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The June 30, 2010 gross asbestos survival ratio is lower than the ratio at June 30, 2009 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at June 30, 2010 by approximately 0.3 years and 0.7 years, respectively; and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at June 30, 2009 by approximately 1.0 years and 2.1 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.  The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                   2010    2009      Six Months Ended June 30,   Gross   Net   Gross   Net            Survival ratios:                                Asbestos      4.6      4.2      4.8      3.7        Environmental      4.6      3.7      4.5      3.4        Combined      4.6      4.1      4.8      3.6                    Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations    AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment, operating as SunAmerica Financial Group, is comprised of several life insurance and retirement services businesses that offer a comprehensive suite of life insurance, retirement savings products and guaranteed income solutions through an established multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, career financial advisors, wholesale life brokers, insurance agents and a direct-to-consumer platform.   AIG's Domestic Life Insurance businesses offer a broad range of protection products, including individual term and universal life insurance, and group life and health products. In addition, Domestic Life Insurance offers a variety of payout annuities, which include single premium immediate annuities, structured settlements and terminal funding annuities. Domestic Retirement Services businesses offer group retirement products, individual fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds and financial planning and investment advisory services. Certain previously acquired closed blocks and fixed and variable annuity blocks that have been discontinued are reported as "runoff" annuities. Domestic Retirement Services also maintains a runoff block of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) that were written in (or issued to) the institutional market place prior to 2006.   In managing its Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses). Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) enhances the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of the Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses.

Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in policyholder benefits and claims incurred as a result of less favorable insurance mortality experience.   Pre-tax income for Domestic Life and Retirement Services reflected significantly higher levels of net realized capital losses principally from a $720 million increase from the change in fair value of embedded derivative liabilities, net of economic hedges, driven by negative equity market conditions and declines in long-term interest rates.   Year-to Date Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reported an increase in pre-tax income before net realized capital losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:   •higher net investment income due to a $765 million increase in partnership income and a $632 million increase in valuation gains on ML II;   •DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $601 million in 2009 which primarily were the result of reductions in the long-term growth assumptions for group retirement products and individual variable annuities and deteriorating equity market conditions early in 2009 and projected increases in surrenders for individual fixed annuities. There were no unlockings in the six months ended June 30, 2010; and   •an increase in DAC and SIA benefits of $64 million on net realized capital losses results from an increase in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities.  Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in policyholder benefits and claims incurred as a result of less favorable insurance mortality experience.  144      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Pre-tax income for Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services reflected higher levels of net realized capital losses principally from an increase of $1.2 billion related to derivative fair value losses on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, net of foreign exchange transactions, used to economically hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves. Net realized capital losses were also higher due to a $672 million increase from the change in fair value of embedded derivative liabilities, net of economic hedges, driven by negative equity market conditions and declines in long-term interest rates. These increases in realized capital losses were partially offset by lower other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.5 billion and lower provisions for loan losses.

Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred as a result of less favorable life insurance mortality experience.   Domestic Life Insurance premiums and other considerations declined primarily due to lower fee income as a result of a decline in life insurance in force. Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses declined primarily due to restructuring expenses incurred in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009.   Domestic Life Insurance pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the growth in Net investment income, partially offset by an increase in Net realized capital losses.   Year-to-Date Domestic Life Insurance Results   Domestic Life Insurance pre-tax income before net realized capital losses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to higher Net investment income including a $188 million increase in partnership income and a $202 million increase in the fair value of the interest in ML II. These increases were partially offset by a decline in DAC amortization related to Net realized capital losses of $6 million in 2010 compared to $23 million in 2009 and less favorable life insurance mortality experience.   Domestic Life Insurance Premiums and other considerations declined primarily due to the sale of AIG Life Canada on April 1, 2009 and lower fee income. Premiums and other considerations declined approximately 4 percent excluding the impact of this disposition. Policy acquisition and other expenses declined primarily due to expense reductions.   Domestic Life Insurance reported pre-tax income in the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in the six months ended June 30, 2009 reflecting lower levels of net realized capital losses in 2010, due principally to a $285 million decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges.  145      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Domestic Life Insurance Sales and Deposits  The following table summarizes Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits by product*:                                            Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Life insurance                                          Periodic premium by product:                                            Universal life    $ 8    $ 16      (50 )%  $ 17    $ 30      (43 )%      Variable universal life      19      1     -      19      9      111        Term life      22      18     22      38      42      (10 )      Whole life/other      -      1     -      1      3      (67 )              Total periodic premiums by product      49      36     36      75      84      (11 )    Group life/health      15      11     36      37      66      (44 )    Unscheduled and single deposits      52      17     206      67      54      24                Total life insurance      116      64     81      179      204      (12 )          Career distribution                                            By product:                                              Periodic life insurance premiums      24      19     26      43      35      23          Unscheduled and single deposits      7      5     40      12      9      33          Accident and health insurance      1      2     (50 )    3      3      -          Fixed annuities      18      41     (56 )    35      97      (64 )                Total career distribution      50      67     (25 )    93      144      (35 )            Payout annuities      186      125     49      403      316      28        Individual fixed and runoff annuities      143      199     (28 )    304      394      (23 )          Total sales and deposits    $ 495    $ 455     9 %  $ 979    $ 1,058      (7 )%             *Includes divested operations. Life insurance sales include periodic premiums from new business expected to be collected over a one-year period and unscheduled and single premiums from new and existing policyholders. Sales of group accident and health insurance represent annualized first-year premium from new policies. Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing customers.   Total Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to higher private placement variable universal life sales and increased payout annuity sales, partially offset by lower fixed annuity sales. Payout annuity sales increased as a result of improved structured settlement and immediate annuity sales. Fixed annuity sales declined as a result of the low interest rate environment.   Total Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to lower fixed annuity deposits, life insurance premiums and the sale of AIG Life Canada in 2009, partially offset by increased payout annuity sales. Sales and deposits were essentially unchanged excluding the impact of the Canada disposition. Fixed annuity sales declined as a result of the low interest rate environment while life insurance premiums decreased primarily due to lower Domestic Life Insurance financial strength ratings. Payout annuity sales increased as a result of improved structured settlement and immediate annuity sales.  146      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Domestic Retirement Services Results  The following table presents Domestic Retirement Services results:                                          Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009              Premiums and other considerations    $ 287    $ 272     6 %  $ 562    $ 530      6 %      Net investment income      1,578      1,286     23      3,251      2,391      36        Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      961      1,039     (8 )    1,842      2,256      (18 )      Policy acquisition and other expenses      234      613     (62 )    545      1,102      (51 )          Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses)      670      (94 )   -      1,426      (437 )    -      Net realized capital gains (losses)      (866 )    24     -      (1,522 )    (1,162 )    -            Pre-tax loss    $ (196 )  $ (70 )   - %  $ (96 )  $ (1,599 )    - %            Quarterly Domestic Retirement Services Results   Domestic Retirement Services pre-tax income before net realized capital gains (losses) increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:   •lower policy acquisition expenses as a result of lower DAC and SIA amortization of $403 million on higher net realized capital losses, due to an increase in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities combined with the absence in 2010 of the $43 million DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening in 2009 which primarily related to projected increases in surrenders for individual fixed annuities; and   •higher net investment income due to a $110 million increase in partnership income and a $154 million increase in valuation gains on ML II.   Pre-tax loss for Domestic Retirement Services reflected significantly higher levels of net realized capital losses due primarily to $494 million of losses from the change in fair value of embedded derivative liabilities, net of economic hedges, in the three months ended June 30, 2010, compared to gains of $228 million in the three months ended June 30, 2009. The losses in the current quarter were driven by negative equity market conditions and declines in long-term interest rates.   Year-to-Date Domestic Retirement Services Results   Domestic Retirement Services pre-tax income before net realized capital gains (losses) increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:   •DAC and SIA unlockings and related reserve strengthening charges of $601 million in 2009 which primarily were the result of reductions in the long-term growth assumptions for group retirement products and individual variable annuities and deteriorating equity market conditions early in 2009 and projected increase in surrenders for individual fixed annuities. There were no unlockings in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010;   •higher net investment income due to a $577 million increase in partnership income and a $430 million increase in valuation gains on ML II; and   •an increase in DAC and SIA benefits of $81 million on higher net realized capital losses results from an increase in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities.   Pre-tax loss for Domestic Retirement Services reflected higher levels of net realized capital losses principally from an increase of $1.2 billion related to derivative fair value losses on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, net of foreign exchange transactions, used to economically hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves. Net realized losses were also higher due to $448 million of losses from the change in fair value of embedded derivative liabilities, net of economic hedges, in the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to gains of $224 million in the six months ended June 30, 2009, driven by negative equity market conditions and declines in long term interest rates.

Individual fixed annuity deposits increased primarily due to bank partner reinstatements and to negative AIG publicity in 2009 which adversely affected 2009 deposits. Variable annuity sales increased due to competitive product enhancements, reinstatements at a number of key broker-dealers and increased wholesaler productivity.   Surrender rates have improved compared to the prior year for group retirement products, individual fixed annuities and individual variable annuities as surrenders have returned to more normal levels.   The following table presents reserves by surrender charge category and surrender rates:                                         June 30, 2010   June 30, 2009      (in millions)   Group Retirement Products*   Individual Fixed Annuities   Individual Variable Annuities   Group Retirement Products*   Individual Fixed Annuities   Individual Variable Annuities              No surrender charge    $ 47,829    $ 12,719    $ 10,230    $ 43,592    $ 10,094    $ 9,234        0% – 2%      1,203      3,492      3,701      1,792      2,931      3,308        Greater than 2% – 4%      1,767      5,329      1,720      1,894      6,559      2,103        Greater than 4%      2,993      23,314      6,472      3,099      23,331      6,930        Non-Surrenderable      913      3,144      1,195      914      3,209      1,026              Total Reserves    $ 54,705    $ 47,998    $ 23,318    $ 51,291    $ 46,124    $ 22,601            Surrender rates      10.7 %    7.6 %    11.4 %    12.0 %    19.3 %    13.1 %             *Excludes mutual funds of $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.       Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations    AIG's Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations include insurance and investment-oriented products such as whole and term life, investment linked, universal life and endowments, personal accident and health products, group products including pension, life and health, and fixed annuities. The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services products are sold through independent producers, career agents, financial institutions and direct marketing channels.   In managing its Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses). Pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of pre-tax income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) enhances the understanding of the operating performance of the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the table that follows.   Following the classification of ALICO and Nan Shan as discontinued operations (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), AIG's remaining Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations are conducted through AIA, AIRCO (together Asia), AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Ltd (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) (together Japan).  149                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   The following table presents Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services results:                                          Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Total Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 3,377    $ 3,100      9 %  $ 6,611    $ 6,222      6 %      Net investment income      1,239      2,428      (49 )    2,306      3,306      (30 )      Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      2,808      4,068      (31 )    5,455      6,556      (17 )      Policy acquisition and other expenses      988      907      9      1,860      1,697      10            Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains (losses)      820      553      48      1,602      1,275      26      Net realized capital gains (losses)      20      (330 )    -      (41 )    (792 )    -            Pre-tax income    $ 840    $ 223      277 %  $ 1,561    $ 483      223 %            Asia Results       The following table presents Asia results:                                            Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Asia:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 2,458    $ 2,231      10 %  $ 4,828    $ 4,448      9 %      Net investment income      892      2,038      (56 )    1,613      2,610      (38 )      Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      2,070      3,292      (37 )    3,991      5,092      (22 )      Policy acquisition and other expenses      676      663      2      1,284      1,260      2            Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains      604      314      92      1,166      706      65      Net realized capital gains      160      107      50      234      79      196            Pre-tax income    $ 764    $ 421      81 %  $ 1,400    $ 785      78 %            AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies and therefore premiums and other considerations reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and from changes in foreign currency translation rates.  The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Asia Premiums and other considerations:                            Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,          2010 vs. 2009   2010 vs. 2009            Increase in original currency*     1.8 %   0.7 %    Foreign exchange effect     8.4     7.9            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars     10.2 %   8.6 %             * Computed using a constant exchange rate each period.   150      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     Quarterly Asia Results   Premiums and other considerations increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange shown above as well as higher in-force business as a result of improvement in persistency from Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and China. Net investment income decreased compared to the same period in 2009 due to a $1.3 billion decline in policyholder trading gains. Net investment income, excluding policyholder trading gains, increased due to higher levels of invested assets and market improvement.   Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains increased significantly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to the factors mentioned above as well as:   •a $134 million loss recognition charge related to the Philippines operations in 2009; and   •the positive effects of the consolidation of a pension trust guaranteed fund under the adoption of the new accounting standard on the consolidation of variable interest entities, tax changes in participating funds and a release in reserves as a result of changes in bonus scale in Singapore totaling $62 million.   This improvement was partially offset by an increase in the long-term incentive program provision and deconsolidation of a divested entity in Indonesia.   Pre-tax income included an increase in net realized capital gains and reflected a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges.   Year-to-Date Asia Results   Premiums and other considerations increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to higher in-force business as a result of improvement in persistency in key Asian markets and higher sales volumes in the first six months of 2010. Net investment income decreased compared to the same period in 2009 due to a $1.3 billion decline in policyholder trading gains. Net investment income, excluding policyholder trading gains, increased due to increased holding in longer dated bonds in Korea and higher dividend income in Thailand.   Pre-tax income before net realized capital gains increased significantly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to the factors mentioned above as well as:   •a $134 million loss recognition charge related to the Philippines operations in 2009; and   •the positive effects of the consolidation of a pension trust guaranteed fund under the adoption of the new accounting standard on the consolidation of variable interest entities, tax changes in participating funds and a release in reserves as a result of changes in bonus scale in Singapore totaling $73 million.   These increases were partially offset by a surrender gain and a business tax refund in China in 2009.   Pre-tax income included an increase in net realized capital gains and reflected a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges.       Asia Sales and Deposits   The following table summarizes first year premium, single premium and annuity deposits for Asia:                                                      Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)            Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)          Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,              Original Currency       Original Currency     (in millions)   2010   2009   U.S. $   2010   2009   U.S. $            First year premium    $ 415    $ 388      7 %    (1 )%  $ 827    $ 745      11 %    2 %    Single premium      201      215      (7 )    (12 )    422      341      24      17      Annuity deposits      57      19      200      162      76      39      95      62             151      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Quarterly Asia Results   First year premium sales increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 on a U.S. dollar basis and declined slightly on original currency basis. Ordinary individual life insurance products contributed over 40 percent of first year insurance sales with a shift from group products to investment-oriented life insurance products as market volatility decreased. Strong first year insurance sales in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, China and Indonesia were partially offset by a decline in Australia, as new business sales returned to normal following the successful acquisition of a few large corporate customers last year, while Korea's first year sales performance was depressed as competition in the direct marketing channel intensified.   Single premium sales declined in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 as Thailand single premium sales were severely affected by the recent political unrest. This decline more than offset increased single premium sales in Singapore and the Philippines.   Annuity deposits increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 due to a successful promotion campaign on fixed annuity deposits in Korea.   Year-to-Date Asia Results   First year premium sales increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 as sales continued to focus on ordinary individual life insurance products in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and China as economic growth solidified and broadened across Asia markets. The increase in investment-oriented life insurance sales in Hong Kong was nearly offset by declines in Korea due to re-pricing of investment-oriented life insurance products.   Single premium sales increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 reflecting increased demand for investment-linked products in Asia as market volatility declined and investors' sentiments improved, in particular in Singapore, Korea and the Philippines.   Annuity deposits increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 on both a U.S. dollar basis and original currency basis compared to the same period in 2009 due to significantly increased fixed annuity deposits in Korea.

Quarterly Japan Results   Premiums and other considerations increased primarily as a result of translation effects due to the Yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009.   Pre-tax income before net realized capital losses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to a reduction in partnership and mutual fund income as well as the continuing impact of lower in-force business and lower surrender gains in 2010 versus 2009 as lapses trended down towards pre-crisis levels.   Net realized capital losses in the second quarter of 2010 include an out of period charge of $181 million relating to foreign currency translation. Excluding this charge, foreign currency translation gains were recognized in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to significant losses in the same period in 2009 as the value of the Yen strengthened against non-functional currencies in 2010 compared to 2009.   Year-to-Date Japan Results   Pre-tax income before net realized capital losses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the continuing impact of lower in-force business and lower surrender gains in 2010 versus 2009 as lapses trended down towards pre-crisis levels and a reduction in the DAC benefit, net of unearned revenue liability, related to lower realized capital losses in 2010 compared to a year ago.   Net realized capital losses declined in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and a decrease in foreign currency translation losses as the value of the Japanese Yen strengthened against non functional currencies in the current year while the value of the Japanese Yen weakened against non functional currencies in 2009.       Japan Sales   In managing the Japan operations, management analyzes sales performance on an annualized new business premium basis. Annualized new business premiums represent the amount of premium expected to be collected over a twelve month period and also include ten percent of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products.       The following table summarizes annualized new business premiums for Japan:                                           Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Life    $ 69    $ 59      17 %  $ 141    $ 122      16 %    Medical      56      43      30      109      88      24      Annuity      45      30      50      78      57      37            Total    $ 170    $ 132      29 %  $ 328    $ 267      23 %           153      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Sales are transacted primarily in yen and therefore annualized new business premiums reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and from changes in the Yen/U.S. dollar translation rate. Annualized new business premiums measured on a constant exchange rate basis are as follows:                                          Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Life    $ 64    $ 58      10 %  $ 129    $ 115      12 %    Medical      51      42      21      99      84      18      Annuity      41      29      41      71      53      34            Total    $ 156    $ 129      21 %  $ 299    $ 252      19 %            Life sales increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 as production in the face to face channels is recovering after the financial crisis. Medical sales growth was supported by the launch of new products early in 2010, resulting in increased sales by both the captive agent and independent producer channels. Annuity sales increased due to a high rate of recapture of maturing annuities driven by a strong Yen exchange rate, and by gradually improving sales from banks that had previously suspended sales of products of AIG Star and AIG Edison.       Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs    DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment-type products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet with DAC and amortized over the life of the business similar to DAC.       The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC/VOBA:                           Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)   2010   2009            Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services                  Balance at beginning of year    $ 11,098    $ 14,447        Acquisition costs deferred      489      511        Amortization charged to pre-tax income      (457 )    (1,045 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities      (979 )    77        Decrease due to foreign exchange      (2 )    (14 )      Other      -      (1,827 )      Consolidation and eliminations      46      -            Balance at end of period    $ 10,195    $ 12,149            Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services                  Balance at beginning of year    $ 24,792    $ 26,166        Acquisition costs deferred      1,055      1,034        Amortization charged to pre-tax income      (814 )    (760 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities      (191 )    13        (Decrease) Increase due to foreign exchange      (140 )    518        Other      (15 )    (166 )      Activity of discontinued operations      (537 )    247        Reclassified to Assets held for sale      (10,438 )    -            Balance at end of period    $ 13,712    $ 27,052             154      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG's DAC and VOBA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG's results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.       Financial Services Operations    AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital markets, and consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations.       Aircraft Leasing    AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.       Capital Markets    Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and engaged in borrowing activities that involve issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into GIAs. AIGFP has continued to unwind its businesses and portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — AIGFP Wind-down.   Historically, AIG's Capital Markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. AIGFP has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. Revenues and pre-tax income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of AIGFP's assets and liabilities and by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the comparative period.       Consumer Finance    AIG's Consumer Finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives most of its revenues from finance charges assessed on real estate loans, secured and unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables.   AIG's foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. At June 30, 2010, AIGCFG had operations in Poland, Taiwan and India. During 2009 and through July 30, 2010, AIG has completed the sale of the AIGCFG operations in Argentina, China, Colombia, Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico, Hong Kong, Brazil, Russia, Taiwan and its banking business in Poland. AIG has also entered into contracts to sell the AIGCFG operations in India.  155      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Financial Services Results        Financial Services results were as follows:                                            Three Months Ended June 30,         Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009            Revenues:                                            Aircraft Leasing    $ 1,232    $ 1,384      (11 )%  $ 2,114    $ 2,665    $ (21 )%      Capital Markets      (50 )    (8 )    -      (284 )    (977 )    -        Consumer Finance      622      778      (20 )    1,401      1,591      (12 )      Other, including intercompany adjustments      81      214      (62 )    162      354      (54 )          Total    $ 1,885    $ 2,368      (20 )%  $ 3,393    $ 3,633    $ (7 )%          Pre-tax income (loss):                                            Aircraft Leasing    $ 173    $ 410      (58 )%  $ 92    $ 726    $ (87 )%      Capital Markets      (132 )    (128 )    -      (430 )    (1,249 )    -        Consumer Finance      (6 )    (191 )    -      (31 )    (497 )    -        Other, including intercompany adjustments      (4 )    33      -      (39 )    14      -            Total    $ 31    $ 124      (75 )%  $ (408 )  $ (1,006 )  $ - %            Quarterly Financial Services Results   Financial Services reported lower pre-tax income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the following:   •AIGFP reported a higher pre-tax loss as unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio amounted to $161 million and $636 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The operating results in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 include net gains of $368 million and net losses of $37 million, respectively, representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including credit valuation adjustment gains of $23 million and credit valuation adjustment losses of $17 million, respectively, reflected in Unrealized market valuation gains (losses) on AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio. Interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios were lower during the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.   •ILFC reported a decline in pre-tax income due to increased interest expense driven by higher composite borrowing rates and an increase in the provision for overhauls as a result of an adjustment to reflect an increase in future reimbursements. Additionally, on July 6, 2010, ILFC signed an agreement to sell six aircraft to a third party. Due to current market conditions, during the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses of $40 million and operating lease related charges aggregating $6 million related to those aircraft. In addition, ILFC recorded $20 million in impairment charges on two aircraft not held for sale.   •Consumer Finance operations reported a decrease in pre-tax losses primarily due to improvement in AGF and AIGCFG results. AGF's pre-tax loss decreased primarily from a decline in provision for loan losses as a result of a decrease in the amounts provided for allowance for loan losses due to favorable trends in the credit quality of AGF's finance receivables in the second quarter of 2010. AGF also benefited from foreign exchange gains on foreign currency denominated debt; lower fair value provision on finance receivables held for sale originated as held for investment; and lower operating expenses due to management expense reductions across all AGF operations. These favorable variances were partially offset by a decline in AGF's finance charges reflecting the 2009 sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF's liquidity management efforts. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, AIGCFG results were negatively impacted by lower loan volumes, higher loan loss provisioning, and higher cost of funds.  156      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Year-to-Date Financial Services Results   Financial Services reported a lower pre-tax loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the following:   •AIGFP reported a lower pre-tax loss as unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio amounted to $280 million and $184 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The operating results in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 include net gains of $319 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including a credit valuation adjustment loss of $90 million and a credit valuation adjustment gain of $89 million, respectively, reflected in Unrealized market valuation gains (losses) on AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio. Interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios were significantly lower during the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.   •ILFC reported a decline in pre-tax income due to increased interest expense driven by higher composite borrowing rates and an increase in the provision for overhauls as a result of an adjustment to reflect an increase in future reimbursements. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, or subsequent thereto, ILFC signed agreements to sell 61 aircraft. Due to current market conditions, ILFC recorded asset impairment losses aggregating $387 million and operating lease related charges aggregating $90 million related to those aircraft. Additionally, ILFC recorded $20 million in impairment charges on two aircraft not held for sale.   •Consumer Finance operations reported a decrease in pre-tax losses primarily due to improvement in AGF and AIGCFG results. AGF's pre-tax loss decreased primarily from a decline in provision for loan losses as a result of a decrease in the amounts provided for allowance for loan losses due to favorable trends in the credit quality of AGF's finance receivables in the first half of 2010. AGF also benefited from foreign exchange gains on foreign currency denominated debt; lower fair value provision on finance receivables held for sale originated as held for investment; and lower operating expenses due to management expense reductions across all AGF operations. These favorable variances were partially offset by a decline in AGF's finance charges reflecting the 2009 sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF's liquidity management efforts. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, AIGCFG results were negatively impacted by lower loan volumes, higher loan loss provisioning, and higher cost of funds.   Quarterly Capital Markets Results   AIGFP reported a higher pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios were lower during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. AIGFP also had positive results related to the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. These positive results were offset by lower market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $161 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to a gain of $636 million for the same period in 2009. For a further discussion, see Executive Overview — 2010 Business Outlook — Financial Services — Capital Markets.   The principal components of AIGFP's valuation gains and losses recognized on its super senior credit default swap portfolio were as follows:   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $83 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $792 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 as a result of increasing corporate spreads in 2010 and decreasing corporate spreads in 2009.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $241 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to unrealized  157      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  market valuation losses of $284 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 reflecting improvement in prices of the underlying assets.    •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $7 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on regulatory capital prime residential mortgage transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one counterparty notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its prime residential mortgage transactions and a related mezzanine transaction. With respect to these two transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transaction early and is required to pay fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final maturity. Because the two regulatory capital transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final legal maturities, there is value to AIGFP due to the counterparty paying its contractual fees beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through the final maturity date.   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.   During the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, AIGFP:   •recognized a loss of $14 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio; and   •incurred interest charges of $537 million compared to $702 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, relating to intercompany borrowings with AIG that were eliminated in consolidation.

AIGFP's pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $23 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The gain was primarily the result of the widening of AIG's credit spreads during the second quarter and the continued tightening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant segment of AIGFP's investment portfolio.  158      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIGFP's pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 includes a net loss representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $17 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. The loss in the second quarter of 2009 was primarily the result of narrowing of AIG's credit spreads, partially offset by the narrowing of corporate credit spreads.   Year-to-Date Capital Markets Results   AIGFP reported a lower pre-tax loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the significant decrease in both interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios along with a larger market valuation gain in 2010 compared to 2009 on its super senior credit default swap portfolio. These positive results were partially offset by the significant decrease related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities. For a further discussion, see Executive Overview — 2010 Business Outlook — Financial Services — Capital Markets.   The principal components of AIGFP's valuation gains and losses recognized on its super senior credit default swap portfolio were as follows:   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $90 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.2 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 as a result of increasing corporate spreads in 2010 and decreasing corporate spreads in 2009.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $399 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to unrealized market valuation losses of $1.1 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 driven primarily by price improvement of the underlying assets.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $26 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, with respect to CDS transactions written on regulatory capital prime residential mortgage transactions.   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.

AIGFP's pre-tax loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $90 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The gain was primarily the result of tightening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant segment of AIGFP's investment portfolio partially offset by the effect on liabilities of the tightening of AIG's credit spreads since December 31, 2009.   AIGFP's pre-tax loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 includes a net gain representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $89 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. The gain in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was primarily the result of significant widening in AIG's credit spreads since December 31, 2008 offset by the impact of continued widening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs.       Other Operations    AIG's Other operations includes results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, and results from other businesses.

(b)Parent & Other contributed its equity interest in ML III to an AIG subsidiary, reported above in other businesses, during the second quarter of 2009.   Parent & Other   Parent & Other pre-tax loss decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to a decline in interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility as discussed in Consolidated Results – Interest Expense and a net gain on sales of divested businesses in 2010 shown in the table below, which included the $228 million termination fee related to the AIA transaction, compared to losses in 2009.   This improvement was partially offset by lower interest income on intercompany loans, which is eliminated in consolidation, higher unallocated expenses, reflecting an increase in securities litigation related charges, and the reclassification of ML III to Other businesses in the second quarter of 2009.   Parent & Other pre-tax loss decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily due to the following:    •a decline in interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •net gains on sales of divested businesses in 2010 compared to losses in 2009; and   •the absence in 2010 of losses related to ML III recorded in 2009 as noted above.    This improvement was partially offset by lower interest income on intercompany loans, which is eliminated in consolidation, and higher unallocated expenses reflecting an increase in securities litigation related charges.  161      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table summarizes the net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses:                                   Gain/(loss)          Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009              AIA termination fee    $ 228    $ -    $ 228    $ -        Transatlantic      -      (217 )    -      (217 )      21st Century      -      (470 )    -      (470 )      HSB      -      -      -      251        Consumer Finance businesses      (40 )    (210 )    (56 )    (199 )      A.I.

Quarterly Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty reported pre-tax income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2009. This improvement reflected a decline in claim and claims adjustment expenses incurred of $806 million. Domestic first-lien, second-lien and international businesses reported pre-tax income of $90 million, $117 million and $30 million respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2010 which was $329 million, $283 million and $101 million higher, respectively, than the three months ended June 30, 2009. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects the decline in loss and loss expenses of $410 million for first-liens, $291 million for second liens and $108 million for international markets. The lower claims and claims adjustment expenses include favorable prior year development of $232 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to unfavorable prior year development of $222 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. The improved pre-tax results correspond to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher mortgage cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has provided services to assist lenders during times of high loan origination activity. In providing these services UGC assumed certain obligations associated with loans on which these services were provided. During the three months ended June 30, 2010 UGC determined that these types of expenses from legacy books of business were increasing and accordingly UGC has increased the provision for these expenses by $64 million to reflect UGC's best estimate of the expected ultimate costs associated with these services. UGC will continue to closely monitor these occurrences and will adjust the provision for these obligations accordingly.       Year-to-Date Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty reported pre-tax income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2009. This improvement reflected a decline in claim and claims adjustment expenses incurred of $1.6 billion, offset in part by an amortization of the second-lien premium deficiency reserve of $222 million in the first quarter of 2009. Domestic first-lien, second-lien and international businesses reported  162      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  pre-tax income of $110 million, $184 million and $35 million respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2010 which was $752 million, $387 million and $132 million higher, respectively, than the six months ended June 30, 2009. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects the decline in loss and loss expenses of $824 million for first-liens, $634 million for second liens and $154 million for international markets. The lower claims and claims adjustment expenses include favorable prior year development of $464 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to unfavorable prior year development of $129 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009. The improved pre-tax results correspond to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher mortgage cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies.   UGC continues to deny claims and rescind coverage on loans (collectively referred to as rescissions) due to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly related to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations have resulted in loan rescissions totaling $146 million of claims on first-lien business during the second quarter of 2010 compared to $58 million during the first quarter of 2010. UGC expects this increased rescission activity to continue during 2010, but at a slowing rate. These rescissions will continue to affect UGC's financial results, but the UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans, consistent with industry practice.       Risk-in-Force   UGC's domestic first-lien mortgage risk in force totaled $25.9 billion as of June 30, 2010 and the 60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans was 18.5 percent (based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice) compared to domestic first-lien mortgage risk in force of $26.7 billion and a delinquency ratio of 14.0 percent at June 30, 2009.   The second-lien risk in force at June 30, 2010 totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.7 billion of risk in force at June 30, 2009. Risk in force represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties. These claims and counterclaims allege breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud among other allegations.   Dispositions    In December 2009, UGC entered into two stock purchase agreements for the sale of its Canadian and Israel operations. The Israel transaction closed on January 21, 2010 and the Canadian transaction closed on April 16, 2010.   Change in Fair Value of ML III   Gains on ML III for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 were $358 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. The improvement in the fair value of AIG's investment in ML III was attributable to the shortening of weighted average life by 1.14 years and 1.53 years for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively. Additionally, fair values for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 were positively affected by a decrease in projected credit losses in the underlying collateral securities.   For the three months ended June 30, 2010, credit spreads widened by 43 basis points which resulted in an overall narrowing of credit spreads by 85 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2010.   Noncore Asset Management Operations   AIG's Noncore Asset Management operations include the results of the MIP program and the Institutional Asset Management businesses, which includes AIG's internal asset management business as well as AIG Global  163      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Real Estate and AIG Markets. AIG Markets acts as a derivative intermediary transacting with AIG and its subsidiaries and the third parties.   On March 26, 2010, AIG completed the sale of its third party asset management business. The results of operations from January 1 through the closing of the sale are included in the Institutional Asset Management results. Subsequent to the sale of AIG's third party asset management business, the revenues of the Institutional Asset Management business (excluding AIG Global Real Estate) are derived from providing asset management services to AIG and its subsidiaries. Both AIG Global Real Estate and the MIP's operating results are impacted by performance in the credit, equity and real estate markets.       MIP Results   The MIP reported a pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to pre-tax income in the same period of 2009 primarily due to losses from the discontinuation of hedge accounting. Economic hedging relationships are being retained despite the discontinuation of hedge accounting.   For the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, MIP reported a lower pre-tax operating loss compared to the same period in 2009 due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments primarily from the improved credit environment and foreign exchange related gains driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The results were also affected by the discontinuation of hedge accounting in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the novation of certain intercompany derivative transactions with AIGFP to another AIG subsidiary, AIG Markets. These novations were done in conjunction with the wind-down of AIGFP. The discontinuation of hedge accounting resulted in additional income statement volatility which will continue for the foreseeable future until hedge accounting is reestablished. Residual balances from de-designated hedges will be amortized prospectively into operating income.   AIG enters into derivative arrangements to hedge the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs. The MIP, which is currently in run-off, has entered into CDS contracts as a writer of protection, with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure in an unfunded form. The portfolio of CDS contracts were single-name exposures and, at inception, were predominantly high grade corporate credits.       Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management recognized lower pre-tax losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 resulting from the sale and deconsolidation of the operating results of AIG's third party asset management business and certain previously consolidated private equity investments. Also contributing to the current quarter decline in operating losses is the positive impact of AIG's widening credit spreads on the valuation of derivative liabilities held through AIG Markets as well as a decline in impairments on proprietary real estate investments.   Real estate impairments of $261 million and $570 million during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, were incurred in the direct investment portfolio as well as through real estate joint ventures as a result of continued pressure on real estate values, occupancy rates and leasing activity. Approximately $19 million and $56 million during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, of these impairments was included in noncontrolling interests, which is not part of pre-tax income (loss). The lack of availability of refinancing and constraints surrounding capital availability has caused management to reduce the estimated time period before sale for certain investments, resulting in impairments.   Noncore Insurance Businesses   Noncore insurance businesses include the operating results of the following divested businesses through the date of their sale.  164      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •Transatlantic    Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis both in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk.   On June 10, 2009, AIG closed a secondary public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock owned directly and indirectly by AIG for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. At the close of the public offering, AIG indirectly retained 13.9 percent of the Transatlantic common stock issued and outstanding. As a result, AIG deconsolidated Transatlantic, which resulted in a $1.4 billion reduction in Noncontrolling interests, a component of Total equity. On March 15, 2010, AIG closed a secondary public offering of 8,466,693 shares of Transatlantic common stock owned by American Home Assurance Company, a subsidiary of AIG, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $452 million.    •21st Century      On July 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of 21st Century Insurance Group and the Agency Auto Division (excluding AIG Private Client Group).    •HSB    On March 31, 2009, AIG closed the sale of HSB, the parent company of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company.         Critical Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:    •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;   •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and flight equipment;   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;   •the allowance for finance receivable losses;   •impairment changes, including other-than-temporary impairments and goodwill impairment;   •liabilities for legal contingencies;   •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of deferred tax assets;   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps (CDS) and AIG's economic interest in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and equity interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) (together, the Maiden Lane Interests);   •classification of entities as held for sale or as discontinued operations;   •fair value of the assets and liabilities, including non-controlling interests, related to acquisitions; and   •AIG's ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of going concern considerations.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. Following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2010. For a complete discussion of AIG's accounting estimates, see the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  165      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses   AGF estimates its allowance for finance receivable losses primarily using migration analysis and the Monte Carlo technique applied to sub-portfolios of large numbers of relatively small homogenous accounts. Both techniques are historically-based statistical techniques that attempt to predict the future amount of losses for existing pools of finance receivables. AGF adjusts the amounts determined by migration and Monte Carlo for AGF management's estimate of the effects of model imprecision, any changes to its underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including the levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.   AGF uses its internal data of net charge-offs and delinquency by sub-portfolio as the basis to determine the historical loss experience component of its allowance for finance receivable losses. AGF used monthly bankruptcy statistics, monthly unemployment statistics, and various other monthly or periodic economic statistics published by departments of the U.S. government and other economic statistics providers to determine the economic component of its allowance for finance receivable losses.   AGF also establishes troubled debt restructuring (TDR) reserves for impaired loans, which are included in its allowance for finance receivable losses. The allowance for finance receivable losses related to AGF's TDRs is calculated in homogeneous aggregated pools of impaired loans that have common risk characteristics. AGF establishes its allowance for finance receivable losses related to its TDRs by calculating the present value (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate prior to modification) of all expected cash flows less the recorded investment in the aggregated pool. AGF uses certain assumptions to estimate the expected cash flows from its TDRs. The primary assumptions for AGF's model are prepayment speeds, default rates, and severity rates.       Allowance for Mortgage and Other Loan Losses   AIG evaluates its mortgage and other loans on either a loan specific basis or a portfolio basis by grouping loans with homogeneous characteristics in accordance with existing allowance for loan loss and credit monitoring policies. Loans that are significant are placed on watch lists due to credit, market or collateral value concerns and are evaluated independently for allowance purposes. Loans are placed on watch lists upon consideration of the realizable value of collateral, the borrower's overall financial condition, resources and payment record, the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective rate and the prospects of support from financially responsible guarantors. Allowances for specific loans are measured based on the present value of future expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate subject to consideration of the fair value of underlying collateral. Any loan subject to a specific allowance is not included in the portfolio reserve population.   Loans that are evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis are done so based on statistical loss estimates. Loans are categorized based on homogeneous characteristics including risk rating, vintage, maturity date, type of loan or collateral, loan to value ratio and debt service coverage. Assumptions about defaults are applied to each portfolio based on management's estimate of historical default and recovery rates using internal and market observable data relative to the characteristics of the portfolio. In addition, assumptions are made regarding changes in value of underlying collateral based on the most current observable market data. The application of such assumptions to each portfolio results in a general valuation allowance to the extent the attributes of each portfolio fall within the designated parameters. Such parameters are analyzed and approved for each reporting period by AIG's Enterprise Risk Management group.       Goodwill Impairment:   Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.   The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.   Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG's reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units,  166      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit's fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit's peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. As part of the impairment test, management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all of AIG's reporting units with AIG's market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values.   If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess.   In connection with the announced sale of ALICO on March 7, 2010 and management's decision that ALICO met the held-for-sale criteria on March 31, 2010, total goodwill of $4.6 billion associated with the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Japan operating segment through that date was allocated among ALICO and the Japan businesses to be retained (retained reporting unit) based on their relative fair values as of March 31, 2010. This resulted in $3.3 billion and $1.3 billion of goodwill being allocated to ALICO and the retained reporting unit, respectively for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairment. Management tested goodwill for impairment in both reporting units and determined the fair values of ALICO and the retained reporting unit exceeded book value at March 31, 2010, by 1 percent and 51 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired.   The fair value of ALICO used to test goodwill for impairment at March 31, 2010 was determined by AIG by considering, among other information, a third-party valuation at March 31, 2010 of the announced proceeds from the sale of ALICO to MetLife. Given the significance of the equity component of the consideration, the fair value of ALICO is sensitive to the market value and volatility of MetLife common stock, the risk-free interest rate yield curve and discount rate assumptions used in estimating fair value. Because the market value of MetLife's common stock declined 13 percent at June 30, 2010 compared with March 31, 2010, AIG updated its goodwill impairment test for ALICO. At June 30, 2010, AIG estimated the fair value of ALICO and determined the fair value of ALICO to be less than its carrying value. Accordingly, AIG performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to ALICO by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of ALICO over the amounts that would be assigned to ALICO's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, AIG determined that all of the goodwill allocated to ALICO should be impaired and, accordingly, recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2010.   There were no events that warranted an update of the fair value of the retained reporting unit at June 30, 2010. As a result of earnings, the book value of the Japan businesses to be retained increased to $4.8 billion at June 30, 2010, such that the March 31, 2010 fair value of the retained reporting unit exceeded its June 30, 2010 book value by 30 percent. AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances, including the operating results and level of net assets of the Japan operating segment that, more likely than not, could reduce the fair value of the Japan operating segment below its carrying amount. It is possible that such future conditions or events might result in an impairment of a portion or all of the $1.2 billion of goodwill remaining in the Japan operating segment in the future.       Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets:   At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, AIG had a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $5.5 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized (a likelihood of more than 50 percent). Realization of AIG's net deferred tax asset depends upon its ability to generate gains on asset sales, including from the divestitures of AIA and ALICO and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to  167      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset, but does not depend on projected future operating income for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group.   When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax asset at June 30, 2010, AIG considered all available evidence, including:   •the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses;   •certain transactions, including the recognition of the gains on asset sales, and the planned divestitures of AIA and ALICO;   •the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards; and   •tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset.   Estimates of future gains generated from specific transactions and tax planning strategies could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG's consolidated financial condition or its results of operations for an individual reporting period.   When estimating the fair values of the subsidiaries to be divested, AIG considered, among other information, valuations prepared for various purposes. During the first quarter of 2010, AIG increased its estimate of the AIA and ALICO expected divestiture proceeds following an updated assessment of the range of valuation estimates that considered, among other factors, the expected proceeds from the sales to Prudential plc and MetLife, Inc. announced in that quarter, which gave rise to the $910 million reduction in the valuation allowance. As discussed in Note 1 herein, on June 2, 2010, AIG and Prudential plc terminated the AIA transaction. Because AIG is continuing with its plans to divest AIA, this termination did not affect the amount of deferred tax asset expected to be realized in connection with the planned divestiture of AIA. This determination was based on an updated assessment of the expected gain and considered a range of possible outcomes associated with alternative divestiture strategies, including an initial public offering.       U.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries:   Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between book carrying value and tax basis of subsidiaries, as well as the level of judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.       Measurement of the Fair Values of the Assets Acquired, Liabilities Assumed, and Noncontrolling Interests of Fuji   On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Chartis International subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji. The acquisition of the additional voting shares for $145 million increased Chartis' total voting ownership interest in Fuji from 41.7 percent to 54.8 percent, which resulted in Chartis obtaining control of Fuji.   Because the acquisition was completed on the last day of the quarter, the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when AIG issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The initial purchase price allocation was based on the information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests of Fuji as of the acquisition date. Fuji's financial information is reported to Chartis on a quarter lag. As such, Chartis was awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date. Furthermore, at the time, Chartis had not obtained final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate or intangible assets.   During the quarter ended June 30, 2010 Chartis completed the accounting for the acquisition and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded. Chartis obtained the additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date including final appraisals of Fuji's insurance contracts, loans, certain real estate or intangible assets. Adjustments to the revised purchase price  168      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  allocation as of March 31, 2010 may occur if new information becomes known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date.   The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately $406 million, which is included in Other Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). AIG will retrospectively revise its results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 when presenting comparative financial information containing that period. The bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of Fuji's common stock, which AIG believes is the result of macro-economic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fuji's financial condition and results of operations. AIG anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the Fuji shares.   See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview   The following table presents the fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination:                        At June 30, 2010 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 333     93 %    Fair value based on internal sources     26     7            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)   $ 359     100 %             (a)Includes $25 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes. (b)Includes available for sale and trading securities.   See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.       Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability.   At June 30, 2010, AIG classified $38.4 billion and $11.7 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.5 percent and 1.6 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2010. At December 31, 2009, AIG classified $38.9 billion and $13.9 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.6 percent and 1.9 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.  169                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.   Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.       Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    AIG values its assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3.   Private equity and real estate fund investments: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price, i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset. Subsequently, they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. AIG considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement.   Corporate bonds and private placement debt: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued using market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads). When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models using yield curves observed from indices or credit default swap spreads.   Certain RMBS and CMBS: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles considering remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations, or discounted cash flow techniques.   Certain ABS — non-mortgage: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued based on external price/spread data. When position-specific external price data are not observable, the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities.   CDOs: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued based on external price/spread data from independent third parties, dealer quotations, matrix pricing, the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model or a combination of these methods.   Interests in the Maiden Lane Interests: At their inception, ML II and ML III were valued at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. Subsequently, Maiden Lane Interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the Maiden Lane Interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool. The implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with AIG's interests in the capital structure of the respective entities. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.   The fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the Maiden Lane Interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of the Maiden Lane Interests. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.   Refer to Note 5 for sensitivity analysis disclosures with respect to the Maiden Lane Interests.  170      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIGFP's Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.

(d)During the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, AIGFP terminated a super senior CDS transaction with its counterparty with a net notional amount of $296 million, included in Multi-sector CDOs. This transaction was terminated at approximately its fair value at the time of the termination. As a result, a $202 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, AIGFP also paid $35 million to its counterparty with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, a $35 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Multi-sector CDOs also includes $5.6 billion and $6.3 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. (e)During the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, AIGFP terminated super senior CDS transactions with its counterparties with a net notional amount of $5.4 billion, included in Corporate debt/CLOs. These transactions were terminated at approximately their fair value at the time of the termination. As a result, an $8 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Corporate debt/CLOs also includes $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Through July 30, 2010, AIGFP had also received termination notices with respect to an additional $1.8 billion in net notional amount with an effective termination date in 2010. AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of June 30, 2010, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 2.34 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of Basel I that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by Basel II. It was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from Basel I to Basel II by the end of the two-year adoption period on December 31, 2009, after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these CDS transactions, except in a small number of specific instances. However, in 2009, the Basel Committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the Basel I capital floors beyond the end of 2009, although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various European Central Banking districts. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio increased as of June 30, 2010 by approximately one year from December 31, 2009 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of $18.3 billion. Where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the Basel I extension will be effective. Where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early, AIGFP has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits as a result of the extension of the Basel I capital floor announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions.   Included in the Regulatory Capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified AIG that it would not terminate early two of its Prime Residential Mortgage transactions and a related mezzanine transaction with a combined net notional amount of $25.3 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010. With respect to these transactions, the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay AIG fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity. Since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities, there is value to AIGFP representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through to the final contractual maturity date. The fair value of these two super senior transactions as of June 30, 2010 was a derivative asset of $163 million. With respect to these two transactions, AIGFP has also written CDS transactions on the mezzanine tranches of these portfolios; however, the majority of the transactions on the mezzanine tranches were hedged by AIGFP with other third party CDS transactions. The fair value of the net derivative liability for all mezzanine tranches (including hedge transactions) increased from $143 million as of December 31, 2009 to $191 million as of June 30, 2010. For more information on AIGFP collateral calls, see Collateral Calls below.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 other than (1) for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and (2) for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.  173      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents, for each of the regulatory capital CDS transactions in the corporate loan portfolio, the gross transaction notional amount, net notional amount, attachment points, inception to date realized losses and percent non-investment grade:                                    (dollars in millions)  CDS   Gross Transaction Notional Amount at June 30, 2010   Net Notional Amount at June 30, 2010   Attachment Point at Inception(a)   Attachment Point at June 30, 2010(a)   Realized Losses through June 30, 2010(b)   Percent Non-investment Grade at June 30, 2010(c)            1   $ 453   $ 366     10.03%     19.28%     0.52%     25.36%      2     1,497     1,280     10.00%     14.49%     0.16%     28.21%      3     7,131     6,309     11.00%     11.52%     0.00%     9.72%      4     299     78     18.00%     73.80%     0.00%     69.20%      5     9,267     8,209     10.80%     11.42%     0.00%     8.01%      6     4,550     4,016     11.00%     11.75%     0.09%     12.82%      7     3,199     2,730     13.26%     14.66%     0.00%     68.78%      8     2,363     1,967     15.85%     16.77%     0.00%     12.21%      9     828     407     14.00%     35.79%     0.16%     38.66%      10     612     318     14.00%     35.79%     0.16%     38.66%      11     1,497     1,160     14.00%     35.79%     0.16%     38.66%                Total   $ 31,696   $ 26,840                                                               (a)Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to AIGFP for such referenced pools. (e)Terminated effective August 26, 2010.   174      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In virtually all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for a significant majority of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIG receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower, notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. For example, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values, and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. The two pools containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 40.00 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The average number of loans in each pool is over 4,500. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. These transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at June 30, 2010. Three other pools, with a total net notional amount of $1.9 billion, have non-investment grade percentages greater than 35.00 percent, each with a remaining life to maturity of 15.7 years. These pools have realized losses of 0.16 percent from inception through June 30, 2010 and have current weighted average attachment points of 35.79 percent. Approximately 0.75 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default.  175      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 0.00 percent to 3.34 percent.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.   Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on approximately 96.37 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.06 percent to 3.33 percent, averaging 0.84 percent. For all but three transactions, which comprised less than 2.50 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.23 percent and ranged from 0.00 percent to 2.36 percent. The default rate on the remaining three transactions ranged from 4.38 percent to 17.67 percent. The subordination on these three transactions ranged from 36.01 percent to 50.58 percent.   For all regulatory capital transactions, where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses, and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers, and information available from rating agencies, governments, and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will continue to terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.  176      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents AIGFP's Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans portfolio by geographic location:                                                                                                              Weighted Average Maturity (Years)         Ratings of Junior Tranches(d)   At June 30, 2010   Exposure Portfolio   Net Notional Amount (in millions)       Current Average Attachment Point(a)   Realized Losses through June 30, 2010(b)         Percent of Total   To First Call(c)   To Maturity   Number of Transactions   Percent Rated   Average Rating          Primarily Single Country:                                                    Germany   $ 4,375     16.30 %   15.02 %   0.09 % 2.24   8.74   3     100 % A+        Finland     78     0.29 %   73.80 %   -   0.54   4.54   1     100   AAA                                                          Subtotal Single Country     4,453     16.59 %   18.24 %   0.08 % 2.15   8.51   4     100   A+                                                            Regional:                                                    Asia     1,967     7.33 %   16.77 %   -   0.51   1.75   1     100   AAA        Europe     20,420     76.08 %   14.51 %   0.06 % 0.57   2.94   6     100   AA                                                             Subtotal Regional     22,387     83.41 %   14.71 %   0.05 % 0.57   2.84   7     100   AA                                                            Total   $ 26,840     100.00 %   15.32 %   0.06 % 0.84   3.81   11     100   AA                                                                (a)Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

In certain cases, simultaneously with the exercise of the 2a-7 Puts by AIGFP's counterparties, AIGFP accessed financing arrangements previously entered into with such counterparties, pursuant to which the counterparties remained the legal owners of the underlying CDO securities. However, these securities were reported as part of AIGFP's investment portfolio as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Most of these underlying CDO securities were later acquired by ML III from AIGFP's counterparties.

As a result of participation ratios and partial terminations, the attachment point may not always be computed by dividing net notional amount by gross notional amount.   In a number of instances, the level of subordination with respect to individual CDOs has increased since inception relative to the overall size of the CDO. While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

Collateral   Most of AIGFP's credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.   Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of June 30, 2010, 53.6 percent of AIGFP's regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) linked to AIG's credit rating and 46.4 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreement (Master Agreement) or similar agreement, under which the aggregate Exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty, and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans, or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.   181      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Expected Loss Models—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.  Negotiated Amount—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   The following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than AIGFP's super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended:                           (in millions)   December 31, 2009   June 30, 2010   July 30, 2010            Reference to market indices   $ 60   $ 55   $ 43      Expected loss models     20     —     —      Negotiated amount     230     213     222            Total   $ 310   $ 268   $ 265              Arbitrage Portfolio — Multi-Sector CDOs   In the CDS transactions, with physical settlement provisions, in respect of multi-sector CDOs, the standard CSA provisions for the calculation of Exposure have been modified, with the Exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying CDO security, rather than the replacement value of the transaction. As of any date, the "market value" of the relevant CDO security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such CDO security in a market transaction on such date, while the "replacement value of the transaction" is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation (e.g., the CDO security). In cases where a formula is utilized, a transaction-specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of Exposure, which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted. These thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of AIG and/or the reference obligations, with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings. For the large majority of counterparties to these transactions, the Master Agreement and CSA cover non-CDS transactions (e.g., interest rate and cross currency swap transactions) as well as CDS transactions. As a result, the amount of collateral to be posted by AIGFP in relation to the CDS transactions will be added to or offset by the amount, if any, of the Exposure AIG has to the counterparty on the non-CDS transactions.   Arbitrage Portfolio — Corporate Debt/CLOs   All of AIGFP's corporate arbitrage transactions are subject to CSAs. None of these transactions (measured by net notional amount) contains a special collateral posting provision, but each is subject to a Master Agreement that includes a CSA. These transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same Master Agreement and CSA, with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard CSA procedures outlined above. None of these transactions, although subject to a Master Agreement and CSA, has specific valuation and threshold provisions.   Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.   From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFP's estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to  182      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences, including at the present time. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                           (in millions)   December 31, 2009   June 30, 2010   July 30, 2010            Regulatory capital   $ 310   $ 268   $ 265      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO     3,715     3,216     3,206      Arbitrage – corporate     565     526     544            Total   $ 4,590   $ 4,010   $ 4,015              The amount of future collateral posting requirements generally is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the severe market disruption, lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future.   Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio   Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased 0.90 percent and 1.61 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first and second quarters of 2010. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $6.8 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at June 30, 2010, a BET value is available for $4.3 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $2.5 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $4.3 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market  183      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at June 30, 2010 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                            Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at June 30, 2010         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS PRIME   RMBS ALT-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     42 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (279 ) $ (9 ) $ (22 ) $ (131 ) $ (77 ) $ (25 ) $ (15 )             Decrease of 5 points     267     11     23     120     79     14     20                        Increase of 1 year     44     1     7     32     2     1     1      Weighted average life     6.22 years   Decrease of 1 year     (77 )   (2 )   (7 )   (63 )   (3 )   (1 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     20%   Increase of 10%     (34 )   —     (1 )   (9 )   (22 )   —     (2 )                Decrease of 10%     34     1     1     12     19     1     —            Diversity score(a)     13   Increase of 5     (7 )                                                 Decrease of 5     21                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     17                                                   (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  185      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries         Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: General Insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Matched Investment Program. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance & retirement services companies, as well as in the MIP portfolio, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the Commercial Insurance Group historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the Commercial Insurance Group's current risk/return and tax objectives, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by Foreign General Insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk, and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not fair value its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At June 30, 2010, approximately 66 percent of the fixed maturity securities were in domestic entities. Approximately 29 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 12 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspectives for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2010, approximately 14 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 6 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately one third of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  186      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG's fixed maturity investments:                             June 30, 2010*   December 31, 2009            Rating:                    AAA      24 %    23 %      AA      21      24        A      26      28        BBB      20      17        Below investment grade      7      6        Non-rated      2      2            Total      100 %    100 %             *Excludes fixed maturity securities of businesses held for sale as of June 30, 2010.  187                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Available for Sale Investments  The following table presents the amortized cost or cost and fair value of AIG's available for sale securities:                                   (in millions)   Amortized Cost or Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Other-Than- Temporary Impairments in AOCI(a)            June 30, 2010                                    Bonds available for sale:                                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities   $ 5,330   $ 242   $ (10 ) $ 5,562   $ -        Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions     48,968     2,456     (219 )   51,205     -        Non-U.S. governments     49,595     2,991     (278 )   52,308     (1 )      Corporate debt     152,763     11,654     (1,968 )   162,449     126        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                                        RMBS     30,766     1,371     (3,099 )   29,038     (1,396 )        CMBS     10,353     217     (2,527 )   8,043     (539 )        CDO/ABS     7,461     443     (1,020 )   6,884     101              Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized     48,580     2,031     (6,646 )   43,965     (1,834 )          Total bonds available for sale(b)     305,236     19,374     (9,121 )   315,489     (1,709 )    Equity securities available for sale:                                      Common stock     5,515     2,731     (122 )   8,124     -        Preferred stock     653     98     (3 )   748     -        Mutual funds     2,011     191     (58 )   2,144     -            Total equity securities available for sale     8,179     3,020     (183 )   11,016     -            Total(c)   $ 313,415   $ 22,394   $ (9,304 ) $ 326,505   $ (1,709 )          December 31, 2009                                    Bonds available for sale:                                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities   $ 5,098   $ 174   $ (49 ) $ 5,223   $ -        Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions     52,324     2,163     (385 )   54,102     -        Non-U.S. governments     63,080     3,153     (649 )   65,584     (1 )      Corporate debt     185,188     10,826     (3,876 )   192,138     119        Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                                        RMBS     32,173     991     (4,840 )   28,324     (2,121 )        CMBS     18,717     195     (5,623 )   13,289     (739 )        CDO/ABS     7,911     284     (1,304 )   6,891     (63 )            Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized     58,801     1,470     (11,767 )   48,504     (2,923 )          Total bonds available for sale(b)     364,491     17,786     (16,726 )   365,551     (2,805 )    Equity securities available for sale:                                      Common stock     4,460     2,913     (75 )   7,298     -        Preferred stock     740     94     (20 )   814     -        Mutual funds     1,264     182     (36 )   1,410     -            Total equity securities available for sale     6,464     3,189     (131 )   9,522     -            Total(c)   $ 370,955   $ 20,975   $ (16,857 ) $ 375,073   $ (2,805 )             (a) Represents the amount of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income, which, starting on April 1, 2009, were not included in earnings.

Although the market value has improved and CMBS spreads have tightened during the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, the market value of the holdings continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.  193      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries      Investments in CDOs   The following table presents AIG's CDO investments, other than those of AIGFP, by collateral type:                                                     June 30, 2010    December 31, 2009      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Collateral Type:                                                                    Bank loans (CLO)    $ 1,986    $ 68    $ (543 )  $ 1,511      77 %  $ 2,015    $ 63    $ (596 )  $ 1,482      75 %      Synthetic investment grade      199      191      (11 )    379      8      220      83      (21 )    282      8        Other      352      23      (92 )    283      14      443      27      (107 )    363      16        Subprime ABS      28      1      (20 )    9      1      33      1      (27 )    7      1            Total    $ 2,565    $ 283    $ (666 )  $ 2,182      100 %  $ 2,711    $ 174    $ (751 )  $ 2,134      100 %           The following table presents AIG's CDO investments, other than those of AIGFP, by credit rating:                                                     June 30, 2010    December 31, 2009      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Rating:                                                                    AAA    $ 163    $ 7    $ (8 )  $ 162      6 %  $ 326    $ 5    $ (42 )  $ 289      12 %      AA      147      1      (16 )    132      6      135      1      (29 )    107      5        A      591      16      (150 )    457      23      1,028      22      (311 )    739      38        BBB      882      29      (276 )    635      34      670      19      (214 )    475      25        Below investment grade      781      220      (216 )    785      31      550      108      (155 )    503      20        Non-rated      1      10      -      11      -      2      19      -      21      -            Total    $ 2,565    $ 283    $ (666 )  $ 2,182      100 %  $ 2,711    $ 174    $ (751 )  $ 2,134      100 %                  Commercial Mortgage Loans   At June 30, 2010, AIG had direct commercial mortgage loan exposure of $14.7 billion, with $14.3 billion representing U.S. loan exposure.

AIG has recognized the other-than-temporary impairment charges (severity losses) shown above in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. With the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard on April 1, 2009, such severity loss charges subsequent to that date exclusively related to equity securities and other invested assets. In all prior periods, such charges primarily related to mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized securities, corporate debt securities of financial institutions and other equity securities. Notwithstanding AIG's intent and ability to hold such securities until they had recovered their cost or amortized cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that  198      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.   Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.   In addition to the above severity losses, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 related to:    •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments and private equity investments.    With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.12 percent and 0.05 percent of Total equity in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security.

(e)Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.   For the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $9.0 billion reflecting an increase in fair value primarily due to the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of June 30, 2010, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for more than 12 months, comprising the unrealized loss of $2.5 billion related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 189 securities with an amortized cost of $1.6 billion and a net unrealized loss of $1.1 billion, are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. Current market spreads continue to be significantly wider for securities supported by real estate related assets, compared to spreads at the securities' respective purchase dates, largely due to the continued effects of the recession and the economic and market uncertainties regarding future performance of commercial and residential real estate. In addition, declining LIBOR rates have made floating rate securities less attractive as a class.   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based  200      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.   See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Regulation    Directive 2002/87/EC (Directive) issued by the European Parliament provides that certain financial conglomerates with regulated entities in the European Union are subject to supplementary supervision. Pursuant to the Directive, the Commission Bancaire (the French banking regulator) was appointed as AIG's supervisory coordinator. From February 2007 until March 2010, with the approval of the Commission Bancaire, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) acted as AIG's equivalent supervisor, as permitted by the Directive in circumstances in which a financial conglomerate organized outside the European Union (such as AIG) has proposed to have one of its existing regulators recognized as its coordinator and such regulator's supervision is determined to be equivalent to that required by the Directive. Since March 2010, AIG has been in discussions with the Commission Bancaire regarding the possibility of proposing another of AIG's existing regulators as its equivalent supervisor.   On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject AIG to substantial additional federal regulation, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years. AIG cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally; impact AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition; or require AIG to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of AIG's credit ratings.   Key aspects identified to date of Dodd-Frank's potential impact on AIG include:    •The new legislation provides two scenarios under which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) could become AIG's regulator: (1) if AIG is recognized as a "savings and loan holding company" as defined by the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) and/or (2) if it is determined by the newly created risk regulator — the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) — designates AIG as a company whose material financial distress, or whose nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness or mix of activities, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.   •If AIG becomes subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB, the FRB would have authority to impose capital requirements on AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to insurance-based organizations, nor can AIG predict how the FRB will exercise potential general supervisory authority over AIG as to its business practices or those of its subsidiaries. If designated as a Designated Financial Company, AIG would become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress.   •Under either scenario, AIG may become subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB in consultation with the newly created Federal Insurance Office (discussed below) to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, AIG has the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. AIG cannot predict how the stress tests will be designed or conducted or whether the results thereof will cause AIG to alter its business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors about AIG's financial strength.   201      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that AIG and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.   •If AIG is considered a banking entity for purposes of the "Volcker Rule" AIG would become subject to the provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the rule's exceptions, "proprietary trading" and the sponsorship of, or investment in, hedge, private equity or similar funds.   •Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, upon a determination (with the approval of the director of the Federal Insurance Office if — as is true with respect to AIG — the largest United States subsidiary is an insurer) that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability.   •Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets and certain market participants which could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries, as well as AIGFP.   •Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury to be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office would perform various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council and participating in the Council's decisions regarding insurers (potentially including AIG), to be designated for stricter regulation. The director would also be required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. The FIO may recommend enhanced regulations to the states.   •Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a savings and loan holding company or a Designated Financial Company to place its financial activities in an intermediate holding company separate from non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes restrictions on transactions between the two businesses, which could be burdensome and costly to implement.   •Dodd-Frank establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. The BCFP will have significant authority to implement and enforce Federal consumer financial laws, including the new protections established under Dodd-Frank, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices. In addition, the BCFP will have broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over certain consumer products, such as mortgage lending. Insurance products and services are not within the BCFP's general jurisdiction, and broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the BCFP's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.   •Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan. These changes may adversely affect AGF's or UGC's business.   •Dodd-Frank seeks to increase efficiency, reduce transaction costs and improve consumer access in the nonadmitted property and casualty insurance market (excess and surplus lines) and to reform the regulation of the reinsurance markets. AIG expects that these measures will make Lexington's operations more streamlined and efficient, although they could lead to greater competition in these markets.   •Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect AIG's business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith, including:     •The SEC is required to conduct a study and may impose on registered broker-dealers who provide to retail investors personalized investment advice a new standard of conduct the same as or similar to the    202      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    overall standard for investment advisers (i.e. a fiduciary standard). The SEC may also require broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products to make certain disclosures and obtain customer consents or acknowledgements.    •The SEC and other regulators are required to promulgate regulations requiring the originator of certain asset-backed securities to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of securities sold, which may apply to activities of subsidiaries of AIG as part of their funding activities in the future.     Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including (as applicable to AIG) ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by AIG into state guaranty funds). AIG cannot predict the potential effects the new legislation will have on its organizational structure, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse.   Foreign governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject AIG to substantial additional regulation.   In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and exploring steps to avoid similar problems in the future. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. These proposals address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which AIG's subsidiaries conduct business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims.   AIG cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management in the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Credit Risk Management    AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark-to-market), deposits and letters of credit (both in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.  203      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity:                         At June 30, 2010 Category   Risk Rating(a)   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity(b)            Investment Grade:                    10 largest combined     A- (c)    114.8 %(d)      Single largest non-sovereign (financial institution)     BBB-     9.5        Single largest corporate     AA     3.3        Single largest sovereign     AAA     26.8      Non-Investment Grade:                    Single largest sovereign     BB-     2.1        Single largest non-sovereign     BB     0.7               (a)Reflects AIG's internal risk ratings.  (b) Amounts shown include ALICO and Nan Shan as the sales have not yet closed.  (c) Six of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions and four are to investment-grade rated sovereigns. Based on support from the US Government, the exposure to government-sponsored entities is included in the US Government total, rather than in financial institutions. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB- or its equivalent. (d)Exposure to the ten largest combined as a percentage of Total equity was 102.8 percent at December 31, 2009.   AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Ten countries have cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2010 and nine had such exposures at December 31, 2009. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, as of June 30, 2010, six countries were rated AAA, three were rated AA and one was rated A. The two largest cross-border exposures are to Bermuda and the United Kingdom.   In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG's single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms and insurance and reinsurance companies.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity:                      At June 30, 2010   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity(a)            Industry Category:              Money Center / Global Bank Groups      78.5 %(b)      European Regional Financial Institutions     13.7        Global Life Insurance Companies     12.6        Global Reinsurance Companies     12.3        Asian Regional Financial Institutions     10.2        Supranational Banks     8.2        North American Based Regional Financial Institutions     7.9               (a)Amounts shown include ALICO and Nan Shan as the sales have not yet closed.  (b) Exposure to Money Center/Global Bank Groups as a percentage of Total equity was 83.9 percent at December 31, 2009.   AIG's exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 33.3 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2010 compared to 33.5 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2009.  204                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   AIG also has a risk concentration through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG holds approximately $48.4 billion of tax-exempt and taxable securities, $5.5 billion of which are defeased, issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories. A majority of these securities are held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property-casualty insurance companies. These securities are comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The average credit quality of these issuers is A.   Currently, several states, local governments and other issuers are facing pressures on their budget revenues from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG's portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers is the State of California, of which AIG holds approximately $958 million of general obligation bonds, $69.9 million of which are defeased. Nevertheless, despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does not expect any significant defaults in portfolio holdings of municipal issuers.   AIG has credit exposure to several sovereign governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed on review in recent months by one or more major nationally recognized statistical rating agencies. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits and rising government debt to GDP ratios. As of June 30, 2010, AIG had exposure of $937 million to the government of Greece, which has been downgraded to below investment grade by two major rating agencies. At June 30, 2010, AIG's exposure to other notable European governments, such as Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Hungary, amounts to $1.95 billion. Four of these five governments (Italy is the exception) have experienced rating downgrades during the first half of 2010.   The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. The CRC may adjust limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.       ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2010, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  205      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Part II — OTHER INFORMATION        ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings    Included in Note 9(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       ITEM 1A. Risk Factors        The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may subject AIG to substantial additional federal regulation which may materially and adversely affect AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings.    On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and may subject AIG to substantial additional federal regulation, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years.   AIG may become subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB as a savings and loan holding company or a Designated Financial Company. In such a case,    •the FRB would have authority to impose minimum risk-based and capital requirements on AIG and its subsidiaries that are not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions;   •AIG may become subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB in consultation with the Federal Insurance Office to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, AIG has the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions;   •AIG may be required to place its financial activities in an intermediate holding company separate from non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and subject to restrictions on transactions between the two businesses;   •AIG may become subject to limits on "proprietary trading" and the sponsorship of, or investment in, hedge, private equity or similar funds; and   •AIG may become subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver.    In addition, if determined to be a Designated Financial Company regulated by the FRB, AIG would be subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress.   AIG cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision AIG may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally or AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. It is possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank could significantly alter AIG's business practices, require AIG to raise additional capital, impose burdensome and costly requirements and add additional costs. Some of the regulations may also affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about AIG's financial strength and could potentially affect AIG's financing costs or result in a ratings downgrade.   The following updates the "Execution of Restructuring Plan" risk factor in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   AIG May Engage in a Transaction with the Government that Could Result in Significant Dilution to AIG's Current Shareholders and/or the Disposition of Non-Core Assets to the Government. In accordance with its longstanding commitment to repay its obligations to the U.S. government, AIG has commenced discussions with the FRBNY, the United States Department of the Treasury and the trustees of the Trust with respect to a proposed strategy to  206      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries repay the FRBNY Credit Facility and allow the government to exit its ownership relationship with AIG. This strategy could result in the issuance of a large number of additional shares of AIG common stock or other equity securities of AIG and/or the disposition of non-core assets (or interests therein) to the government. No assurance can be given that AIG will reach an agreement with the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury and the Trust on a repayment/exit transaction or what the terms of such transaction would be.
