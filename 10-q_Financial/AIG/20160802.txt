Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.” The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Book Value Per Common Share. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA are used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Return on Equity. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI and DTA. The reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A on a consolidated basis.     77       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income attributable to AIG. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. For example, certain ratios and other metrics described below:    • deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges; • changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits; • changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; • other income and expense — net, related to Corporate and Other run-off insurance lines; • loss on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • non‑qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital gains and losses;   • income or loss from discontinued operations; • income and loss from divested businesses, including:  • gain on the sale of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC); and • certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and related tax effects; • legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; • reserve development related to non-operating run-off insurance business; and • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization.       Operating revenue excludes Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). We use the following operating performance measures within our Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reportable segments as well as Corporate and Other.   • Commercial Insurance: Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty; Consumer Insurance: Personal Insurance • Pre‑tax operating income: includes both underwriting income and loss and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital gains and losses, other income and expense — net, and non-operating litigation reserves and settlements. Underwriting income and loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses. · Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes.      78       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. • Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each. Catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders, that meet the $10 million threshold. We believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an on-going basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.   · Commercial Insurance: Institutional Markets; Consumer Insurance: Retirement and Life • Pre‑tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income:     • changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;   • changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; and     • net realized capital gains and losses;   • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements.    • Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts and mutual funds. · Corporate and Other — Pre‑tax operating income and loss is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income and loss:    • loss on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; • income and loss from divested businesses, including Aircraft Leasing;   • net gain or loss on sale of divested businesses, including: · gain on the sale of ILFC; and  · certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and our share of AerCap’s income taxes;  • non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;  • reserve development related to non-operating run-off insurance business; and • restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization.    Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.        79       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW          EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG’s securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, together with the 2015 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.  We report our results of operations as follows: · Commercial Insurance – Commercial Insurance offers insurance products and services to commercial and institutional customers worldwide. Commercial Insurance product lines include Casualty, Property, Specialty, Financial, Mortgage Insurance and Institutional Markets. Commercial Insurance products are distributed through a diversified multichannel distribution network that includes independent insurance brokers, banks, mortgage lenders, and specialized marketing and consulting firms.  · Consumer Insurance – Consumer Insurance offers a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and property casualty products and services to individuals and groups. Consumer Insurance products include term life, whole life, universal life, accident and health, variable and index annuities, fixed annuities, group retirement plans, mutual funds, financial planning, automobile and homeowners insurance, travel insurance, and warranty and service programs. Consumer Insurance offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network, which includes broker-dealers, agencies and independent marketing organizations, banks, brokers, partnerships, travel agents, affiliated financial advisors, and direct-to-consumer platforms.  · Corporate and Other – Corporate and Other consists of income from assets held by AIG Parent and other corporate subsidiaries, general operating expenses not attributable to specific reportable segments and interest expense. It also includes run-off lines of insurance business. On January 26, 2016, we announced several actions designed to create a leaner, more profitable and focused insurer. These actions include a plan to reorganize our operating model into “modular”, more self-contained business units to enhance transparency and accountability. Additionally, we are introducing a new Legacy Portfolio that aims to maximize value and release capital of certain run-off non-strategic assets and highlight progress on improving the return on equity (ROE) of our Operating Portfolio. When the new operating structure is finalized, the presentation of our segment results may be modified and prior periods’ presentation may be revised to conform to the new structure.      80       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Executive Summary Financial Performance         Commercial Insurance pre‑tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an underwriting loss compared to underwriting income from Property Casualty in the same period in the prior year and lower returns on alternative investments which resulted in a decrease in net investment income in Property Casualty and Institutional Markets. The underwriting loss for Property Casualty was driven primarily by higher catastrophe losses and net loss reserve discount charge compared to a benefit in the prior year. This impact was partially offset by an improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development and lower general operating expenses as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in Property Casualty underwriting results was partially offset by an increase in underwriting income from Mortgage Guaranty resulting from an improved combined ratio.  Commercial Insurance pre‑tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower underwriting income in Property Casualty and lower returns on alternative investments which resulted in a decrease in net investment income partially offset by an increase in underwriting income from Mortgage Guaranty. The underwriting results for Property Casualty were impacted by significantly higher catastrophe losses and a net loss reserve discount charge compared to a benefit in the same period in the prior year as a result of decreases in the forward yield curve rates used for discounting. These results were partially offset by an improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted and lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development compared to the same period in the prior year. Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income increased  in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to higher underwriting income in Personal Insurance and improved mortality results in Life, partially offset by lower returns on alternative investments which resulted in a decrease in net investment income for Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance. Personal Insurance pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting strategic actions to reduce expenses and refocus direct marketing activities, partially offset by higher current year accident losses, including a single large loss, and lower net investment income. Retirement pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income from alternative investments, partially offset by a decrease in general operating expenses from lower employee-related expenses. Life pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to more favorable mortality experience and lower domestic general operating expenses due to reductions in employee-related expenses. Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower returns on alternative investments resulting in lower net investment income in Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance. The lower net investment income was partially offset by improved underwriting results in Personal Insurance due to an improved accident year loss ratio, as adjusted and lower general operating expenses, favorable mortality experience in Life and lower domestic general operating expenses in Retirement and Life. Corporate and Other reported pre-tax operating losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to pre-tax operating income in the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower earnings on investments for which the fair value option was elected, including ABS CDOs and part of our holdings in People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group) and PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) (collectively, our PICC Investment), as well as equity earnings from shares in AerCap in same period in the prior year, which was divested in 2015. Additionally, Run-off insurance lines reported pre-tax operating losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to pre-tax operating income in the same periods in the prior year. The pre-tax operating losses in Run-off insurance lines were driven by a charge for the discount on excess workers’ compensation reserves in the three- and six-month periods ended June      81       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      30, 2016 compared to a benefit in the same periods in the prior year, largely driven by decreases in the forward yield curve rates used for discounting.  Our investment portfolio performance declined in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower returns on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. Our investment portfolio performance declined in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to negative performance in hedge funds, and lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by an increase in invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. Net realized capital gains increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due primarily to higher realized capital gains from sales of investments, primarily from the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment. In addition, other-than temporary impairment charges decreased due to an impairment charge on our previously held Aercap investment recognized in the second quarter of 2015.  We recorded net realized capital losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to foreign exchange losses and impairments, which were slightly higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment, compared to net realized capital gains in the same period in the prior year, which was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and net gains on the sales of various securities such as the Class B shares of Prudential Financial. See MD&A – Investments – Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses for further discussion. In keeping with our broad and on-going efforts to transform AIG for long-term competitiveness, results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 included approximately $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, of pre-tax restructuring and other costs, primarily composed of employee severance and contract termination charges. We continue to execute initiatives focused on organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization, which are expected to result in pre-tax restructuring and other costs of approximately $1 billion (of which approximately $0.8 billion has been recognized) as well as generate pre-tax annualized savings of approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion when fully implemented.     82       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Our Performance – Selected Indicators                          Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended                     June 30,       June 30,         (in millions, except per share data and ratios)               2016       2015           2016           2015         Results of operations data:                                                         Total revenues           $   14,724   $   15,699       $   26,503       $   31,674         Income from continuing operations               1,934       1,775           1,778           4,251         Net income attributable to AIG               1,913       1,800           1,730           4,268         Net income per common share attributable to AIG (diluted)           1.68       1.32           1.49           3.10         After-tax operating income attributable to AIG           $   1,113   $   1,893       $   1,886       $   3,584         After-tax operating income per common share                                                         attributable to AIG (diluted)               0.98       1.39           1.62           2.60         Key metrics:                                                         Commercial Insurance                                                         Pre-tax operating income           $   1,088   $   1,500       $   1,977       $   2,962         Property Casualty loss ratio               75.0       70.8           71.6           69.5         Property Casualty accident year loss ratio, as adjusted           62.4       66.6           63.4           65.5         Property Casualty combined ratio               102.1       98.8           99.6           97.9         Property Casualty accident year combined ratio, as adjusted           89.5       94.6           91.4           93.9         Property Casualty net premiums written           $   4,424   $   5,583       $   8,731       $   10,630         Mortgage Guaranty domestic first-lien new insurance written           12,985       15,190           21,812           25,732         Institutional Markets premiums               215       643           450           739         Institutional Markets premiums and deposits               506       680           810           826         Consumer Insurance                                                         Pre-tax operating income           $   1,104   $   1,023       $   1,892       $   1,968         Personal Insurance loss ratio               55.7       52.7           54.1           55.8         Personal Insurance accident year loss ratio, as adjusted               55.0       52.8           54.1           54.6         Personal Insurance combined ratio               95.7       99.7           94.8           101.5         Personal Insurance accident year combined ratio, as adjusted           95.0       99.8           94.8           100.3         Personal Insurance net premiums written           $   2,922   $   2,930       $   5,734       $   5,845         Retirement premiums               52       44           106           90         Retirement premiums and deposits               6,431       6,070           13,284           11,579         Life premiums               762       702           1,498           1,410         Life premiums and deposits               1,317       1,249           2,568           2,472         Life Insurance Companies assets under management           355,149       336,881           355,149           336,881              83       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW         Common Stock Repurchases:                                                         Aggregate repurchases of common stock           $   2,762   $   2,345       $   6,248       $   3,743         Total number of common shares repurchased               50       40           113           69   *     Aggregate repurchase of warrants               90       -           263           -         Total number of warrants repurchased               5       -           15           -                                                                   * The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 includes (but the aggregate purchase price      does not include) approximately 3.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in January 2015 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in      the fourth quarter of 2014.

Net investment income decreased to $6.7 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $7.7 billion in the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to negative performance in hedge funds, and lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by an increase in invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities, mortgage loans and other fixed income investments with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $18.0 billion as of June 30, 2016, from approximately $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2015, due to a decline in interest rates and a narrowing of credit spreads. The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity securities portfolio remains largely unchanged from December 31, 2015. Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights         We maintained financial flexibility at AIG Parent in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016  through $1.5 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $1.4 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies. AIG Parent also received $1.6 billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, including $1.1 billion of such payments in the second quarter of 2016. Our Board of Directors increased our previous share repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), by an additional $3.0 billion on August 2, 2016, resulting in a remaining authorization on such date of approximately $4.0 billion.  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately 113 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.2 billion pursuant to this authorization, and we repurchased 15 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $263 million pursuant to this authorization. Pursuant to a Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan, from July 1 to August 2, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $698 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.  We paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share on each of March 28, 2016 and June 27, 2016. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on August 2, 2016 of $0.32 per share, payable on September 29, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2016. Strategic Outlook Industry Trends         Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2016, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global equity markets, volatile energy markets, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies and the United Kingdom (the UK) advisory referendum in which a majority voted for the UK to withdraw its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). The recent Brexit vote has also affected the      87       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate, increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), and created volatility in the financial markets, which may continue for some time. Interest rates remain low relative to historical levels, and certain markets in which we operate are experiencing negative interest rates. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable annuities and spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products. For investment-oriented products in our Retirement, Life and Institutional Markets operating segments, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset the impact of lower investment yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. As a result, the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields, which could reduce our spreads and future profitability. A sustained low interest rate environment may favorably affect surrender activity of contract holders whose contractual minimum crediting rates are above those currently available in the marketplace. In addition, customers are currently seeking fixed annuities with longer surrender charge periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the increase of surrenders if interest rates rise rapidly in the future. Spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize DAC and related reserves for investment-oriented products. If future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate DAC and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. Additionally, for certain traditional long-duration products for which we are unable to adjust interest rates, including structured settlements and other payout annuities, our future earnings may be reduced in a sustained low interest rate environment, and we may be required to record additional reserves.  The impact of low interest rates on our Property Casualty operating segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. We do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection. For our Property Casualty operating segment, and run-off insurance lines reported within Corporate and Other, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs; the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.  Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense. Currency volatility in the first half of 2016 was acute compared to recent years, as the euro and the British pound weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar, although the Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar in that period. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s potential exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.     88       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      See Results of Operations – Foreign Currency Impact; Results of Operations – Segment Results – Quarterly and Year-to-date Pre-Tax Income Comparison for 2016 and 2015; Results of Operations – Commercial Insurance – Property Casualty Net Premiums Written by Region; and Results of Operations – Consumer Insurance – Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region.    AIG Priorities for 2016      AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2016: · Improving our ROE · Creating a leaner, more profitable and focused insurer by reorganizing our operating model into “modular”, more self-contained business units to enhance transparency and accountability, including through the introduction of a new Legacy Portfolio that aims to maximize value and release capital from the run-off of non-strategic assets  · Reducing general operating expenses · Improving the Commercial Insurance Property Casualty accident year loss ratio  · Returning excess capital to shareholders · Growing book value per common share    Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2016 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2015 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.  COMMERCIAL INSURANCE Outlook and Strategic initiatives            Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Commercial Insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels, currency volatility, and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to limit growth and profitability in some markets and challenge growth of net investment income. Due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, Commercial Insurance has continued to diversify its business focusing on growing profitable segments and geographies, exiting unprofitable lines and developing advanced data and analytics to improve profitability. Property Casualty         Property Casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may partially offset the effect of current economic challenges. In the first half of 2016, the property casualty insurance industry experienced growth in certain classes of business in Property and Financial lines. Property Casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will continue at a faster pace than in developed countries, but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions. As a result of its ongoing strategy to optimize its portfolio and maintain underwriting discipline, Property Casualty expects that net premiums written for the U.S. Casualty line, and to a lesser extent, certain lines within Specialty and Property, will continue to decrease throughout the remainder of the year. In addition, the recent Brexit      89       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      referendum may negatively affect premium production in the European market, both on a reported basis and in original currency. Overall, Property Casualty experienced a modest increase in rate pressure in the first half of 2016. Property Casualty expects that trend to continue in the near term, particularly in certain lines including in the U.S. Property Excess and Surplus market. Property Casualty continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint, diverse product offering, risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience. In the U.S., Property Casualty’s exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. For additional information on TRIPRA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reserves and Exposures and Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks — Terrorism Risk in our 2015 Annual Report. Mortgage Guaranty         During the first half of 2016, the U.S. market for purchase originations and refinance volume remained strong, favorably impacted by improving housing prices and low interest rates.  In addition, the current economic environment has favorably impacted incurred losses through fewer new delinquencies and higher cure rates. If the current economic environment persists, Mortgage Guaranty expects to benefit through increased purchase volume and increased refinancing  activity.  Mortgage Guaranty also  expects  that  the delinquency rate and cure rate will remain near current levels throughout 2016. Mortgage Guaranty believes  the  combination  of  the factors described above will  result  in  favorable  operating  results  for  2016. These favorable trends may be partially offset by an increase in competitive pricing pressure. On December 31, 2015, the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs) issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the GSEs) became effective. Mortgage Guaranty met the PMIERs requirements as of June 30, 2016. Mortgage Guaranty’s minimum required assets under PMIERs were $2.9 billion as of June 30, 2016, and its estimated available assets were $3.3 billion, exceeding the required assets by $400 million. Available assets decreased from $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of dividend payments. Institutional Markets         Institutional Markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management from the structured settlement business and the stable value wrap business, as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to pension buyouts. Volatility in the earnings of our alternative investment portfolio will continue to affect Institutional Markets’ results. In addition, Institutional Markets could incur loss recognition reserve increases, if future yield assumptions were lowered on assets that support certain long-duration products, primarily structured settlements, for which Institutional Markets does not have the ability to adjust interest rates. Lower assumptions for future yields on such assets could result from reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in the sustained low interest rate environment, which may include proceeds from the strategic sale of alternative investments that currently support such products.       90       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Strategic Initiatives               Customer — Strive to be our clients’ most valued insurer by offering innovative products, superior service and access to an extensive global network. Sharpen Commercial Focus — Achieve ROE in excess of target across our businesses primarily through improvements in our loss ratio. Improve our business portfolio through risk selection by using enhanced data, analytics and the application of science to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. Exit or remediate targeted sub-segments of underperforming portfolios that do not meet our risk acceptance or profitability objectives. Drive Efficiency — Reorganize our operating model into “modular”, more self-contained business units to enhance decision making, transparency and accountability, driving performance improvement and strategic flexibility over time; increase capital fungibility and diversification, streamline our legal entity structure, optimize reinsurance, improve tax efficiency and reduce expenses. Invest to Grow — Grow our higher-value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities, continuing initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure, advancing our engineering capabilities, innovating new products and client risk services and delivering a better client experience.      Customer         Our vision is to be our clients’ most valued insurer. We expect that investments in underwriting, claims services, client risk services, science and data will continue to differentiate us from our peers and drive a superior client experience. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we increased global commercial property limits to $2.5 billion per occurrence from $1.5 billion, in response to increased demand for capacity and services from clients managing complex global risks and increasing property values. This increase was the result of recent investments in engineering and analytical capabilities, which in turn allowed us to secure meaningful support from a panel of long-standing reinsurers. Sharpen Commercial Focus          Exit or remediate targeted underperforming portfolios Commercial Insurance is focused on serving our clients by providing the products and services where we have the most potential to deliver value. Experience and emerging data indicate that there are consistently under-performing sub-segments of our business. We will invest and grow where we see opportunity and we will exit or remediate underperforming portfolios. For example, in 2015 we transferred approximately $1.2 billion of loss reserves to our run-off insurance lines and in the first half of 2016 we transferred another $1.3 billion. This enables us to focus on growth opportunities while allowing for more proactive management of the transferred reserves by run-off specialists. We also did not renew certain accounts that did not meet our profit objectives in our Casualty lines and, to a lesser extent, in our Property and Specialty lines. We will continue to further enhance our risk selection process and refine technical pricing through enhanced tools and analytics to achieve this goal.     91       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Drive Efficiency         Narrow geographic footprint while continuing to maintain and improve multinational capabilities Commercial Insurance, along with our other businesses, continues to evaluate the markets and geographies that provide the greatest opportunities, while maintaining the global footprint that our multinational clients greatly value. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our various off-shore centers, taking advantage of opportunities to centralize and standardize processes and platforms. We believe there is great opportunity to further streamline our global operating model. Expand and optimize the use of reinsurance and other risk mitigating strategies  Commercial Insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad‑based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase ROE by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. Commercial Insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency, although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility. In accordance with our strategic plan, during the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a two-year reinsurance arrangement with the Swiss Re Group, under which a proportional share of our new and renewal U.S. Casualty portfolio is being ceded. This arrangement is reducing the impact of the U.S. Casualty loss ratio on our overall loss ratio.  Accelerate micro-segmentation of risks using internal and external data Property Casualty continues to improve decision-making, risk acceptance and pricing based on its ongoing efforts to refine segmentation by customer, industry and geography. For example, after enhancing the segmentation of workers’ compensation, Property Casualty has observed different experience and trends, which helps inform its risk appetite, pricing and loss mitigation decisions. Invest to Grow         Grow most profitable lines Property Casualty continues to focus on growth in our higher-value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities, continuing initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure, advancing our engineering capabilities, innovating new products and client risk services and delivering a better client experience. Property Casualty expects to grow in businesses such as Financial lines, including D&O, Cyber and Mergers & Acquisitions, Large Limit and Middle Market Property, Multinational and certain areas internationally. Mortgage Guaranty expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing its proprietary risk-based pricing strategy. This pricing strategy provides Mortgage Guaranty’s customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk, which we believe will result in an appropriately priced, high-quality book of business. As announced on January 26, 2016, we plan to conduct an initial public offering of up to 19.9 percent of Mortgage Guaranty, subject to regulatory and GSE approval, as a first step towards a full separation. On March 30, 2016, an initial Form S-1 registration statement relating to Mortgage Guaranty was filed with the SEC. An amendment to the initial Form S-1 was filed on May 20, 2016. Institutional Markets is expected to continue growing the structured settlement business and continue contributing to growth in assets under management with stable value wraps and utilizing a disciplined approach to growth and diversification of our business by pursuing select opportunities in areas such as the pension buyout business.     92       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      consumer insurance outlook and STRATEGIC INITIATIVES           Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Retirement         Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates. In addition, higher tax rates and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk-averse investors to elect products without guaranteed living benefits. The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products, although our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. In addition, more highly leveraged competitors have entered the market offering higher crediting rates. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts have higher minimum interest rates, which continue to be attractive to the contract holders, driving better than expected persistency. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices. Consumer Insurance provides products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including rules that generally restrict the provision of investment advice by a fiduciary to ERISA plans and participants and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the fiduciary individual advisor, his or her firm or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen. On April 8, 2016, the DOL published its final fiduciary duty rule (the Final Rule), substantially expanding the definition of fiduciary investment advice. As a result, the circumstances under which financial services providers and financial advisors could be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code when providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans or IRAs are greatly expanded. For additional information on the Final Rule, see Part I, Item 2. MD&A – Regulatory Environment section of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016. We are analyzing the Final Rule’s potential impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisors and us, and preparing to implement the necessary adjustments to come into compliance with the Final Rule. The Final Rule could require us, and our competitors, to make material changes to certain of our business practices and product designs, and could materially affect our ability and the ability of our distribution partners and financial advisors to sell or service certain annuities and other investment products. The initial compliance date of the final rule is April 10, 2017, with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. Once we have completed our analysis of the Final Rule’s potential impact, we intend to strategically invest in the most attractive post-DOL opportunities across the market. Life         Populations are living longer and have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. The Life operating segment addresses these needs with a broad spectrum of products, ranging from the pure protection focus of term life to indexed universal life and investment-oriented products such as variable universal life. Market factors, primarily low interest rates and regulatory changes, have caused the universal life market to shift its focus from guaranteed universal life to indexed universal life products that offer cash accumulation and living benefit options.     93       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Personal Insurance         The need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management continue to support the growth of the Personal Insurance industry. Our Personal Insurance operations focus on group and corporate clients, together with individual customers within national markets. We expect the demand for multinational cross-boundary coverage and services to increase due to the internationalization of clients and customers. Our global presence provides  Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage.  In Japan, the competition for auto insurance has intensified, in part driven by a decline in new car sales and the existence of fewer but larger insurers. In addition, the overall market size in homeowners insurance contracted after the duration restriction on long-term fire insurance became effective in October 2015. In the U.S., we compete in the high net worth market and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients. Outside of Japan and the U.S., our Personal Insurance operating segment continues to invest selectively in markets where we believe higher potential for sustainable profitability exists. Strategic Initiatives              Customer — Strive to be our clients’ most valued insurer. Through our unique franchise, which brings together a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and personal insurance products offered through multiple distribution networks, Consumer Insurance aims to provide customers with the products and services they desire, delivered through the channels they prefer. Information-driven Strategy —  Utilize customer insight, analytics and the application of science to optimize customer acquisition, product profitability, product mix, channel performance and risk management capabilities. Sharpen Consumer Focus — Invest in areas where Consumer Insurance can grow profitably and sustainably. Target growth in select markets according to market size, growth potential, market maturity and customer demographics and narrow our footprint in less profitable markets with insufficient scale. Operational Effectiveness — Simplify processes and enhance operating environments to increase competitiveness, improve service and product capabilities and facilitate delivery of our target customer experience. Investment Strategy — Maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that largely matches the duration characteristics of the related insurance liabilities, and pursue selective yield-enhancement opportunities that meet liquidity, risk and return objectives. Profitability and Capital Management — Deliver solid earnings through disciplined pricing, sustainable underwriting improvements, expense reductions and diversification of risk, and increase capital efficiency within insurance entities to enhance return on equity.      Customer         In striving to be our clients’ most valued insurer, we have implemented initiatives to better serve our target segments. Our focus on ease of doing business for consumers and producers includes enhancements to our platforms and services. We are working to expand relationships with key distribution partners to offer our products across multiple distribution channels.     94       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Information-driven Strategy         We believe that strengthening our information-driven decision making and marketing capabilities through the use of enhanced analytics, stronger platforms and tools, a well-designed product portfolio and expanded relationships may allow us to bring more effective product solutions to our chosen markets.  We focus on rate adequacy through our global underwriting practices and tools and analytics, and seek to optimize the value of our business lines through product and portfolio management and refined technical pricing. We strive to deliver leading customer experience and efficiency through claims best practices, deployment of enhanced operating structures and standardized processes and systems, while managing claims-handling efficiency. Sharpen Consumer Focus         Retirement Income Solutions intends to continue capitalizing on the opportunity to meet consumer demand for guaranteed income by maintaining competitive variable annuity product offerings, while managing risk from guarantee features through risk-mitigating product design and well-developed economic hedging capabilities. Retirement Income Solutions continues to invest in hedging and market risk management capabilities. Retirement Income Solutions has diversified its product portfolio by offering fixed index annuities that also offer guaranteed withdrawal features, which provide additional lifetime income solutions for consumers approaching retirement. Fixed Annuities sales will continue to be challenged by the low interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits; however, they could also lead to higher surrender activity. During periods of equity market volatility, our fixed annuity products provide diversity in our annuity product suite by offering stable returns for retirement savings. The growing market for immediate and deferred income products, driven by customers seeking guaranteed income products, provides an opportunity for Fixed Annuities to increase the diversification of its product portfolio. Life will continue to invest to position itself for growth, serve its customers more effectively, and maintain pricing discipline in its overall strategy. Life’s organization has been aligned to focus on the demographic, governmental and socioeconomic trends unique to each area in which we operate. In January 2016, we announced a plan to improve capital efficiency by using reinsurance to reduce certain statutory reserves that are above economic requirements in our domestic Life business. Personal Insurance aims to provide clients with the products and services they desire, delivered through the channels they prefer. We continue to focus and invest in the most profitable markets and segments, while narrowing our footprint where appropriate. We are also leveraging our multinational capabilities to meet the increasing demand for cross-border coverage and services. Personal Insurance will continue to utilize its strong risk management and market expertise to foster growth by providing innovative and competitive solutions to its customers and distributors. Operational Effectiveness         We are continuing to invest in initiatives that we believe will make our operating platforms simpler and more agile, enabling us to provide superior service and accommodate future growth. In Japan, we continue to invest in technology to improve operating efficiency and ease of doing business for our distribution partners and customers. In the U.S. Life business, we are focused on leveraging our most efficient systems and increasing automation of our underwriting process. We believe that simplifying our operating models will enhance productivity and support further profitable growth.     95       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Investment Strategy         Our investment objective is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities having weighted average durations that are matched to the duration and cash flow profile of our liabilities, to the extent practicable. Our investment strategy is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability matching and available investment opportunities. While a portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies, we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio. See Investments for additional discussion of investment strategies. If these reductions were to include the sale of alternative investments that support certain payout annuities, we could incur additional loss recognition expense on such products, due to updating assumptions to reflect reinvestment at lower future yields. See Critical Accounting Estimates — Insurance Liabilities — Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts (Life Insurance Companies) for discussion of assumptions related to loss recognition testing in our 2015 Annual Report. Profitability and Capital Management         We are focused on enhancing profitability and capital efficiency within our insurance entities through disciplined pricing, in-force profitability management, effective management of risk and expense reductions. For product lines where we have significant equity market risk and exposure to changes in interest rates, we use risk management tools, such as the risk mitigation product features and hedging program in our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement annuity businesses. Additionally, our scale and the breadth of our product offerings provide diversification of risk. Within our Non-Life Insurance Companies, we continue to increase capital efficiency.  In conjunction with our strategic divestiture program, in May 2016, we completed the sale of AIG Advisor Group, our network of independent broker-dealers, to investment funds affiliated with Lightyear Capital LLC and PSP Investments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $225 million. See Results of Operations — Consumer Insurance and Insurance Reserves for additional information about our Consumer Insurance businesses.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following section provides a comparative discussion of our Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, partially offset by increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with certain foreign jurisdictions.  For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 32.8 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income, the impact of an agreement reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to certain tax issues under audit and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, partially offset by a tax charge and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions.  For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 30.4 percent and 32.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations in both periods differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously released to accumulated other comprehensive income, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign jurisdictions. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, there was a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign jurisdictions primarily attributable to changes in projections of future taxable income. The six-month period ended June 30, 2015 includes an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily attributable to the effects of changes in the Japanese tax law enacted on March 31, 2015, partially offset by changes in projections of future taxable income.     97       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following table presents a reconciliation of pre-tax operating income to pre-tax income and after-tax operating income to net income (loss) attributable to AIG:    Three Months Ended June 30,   2016       2015                                                                               Total       After                   Total       After     (in millions)   Pre-tax       Tax       Tax       Pre-tax       Tax       Tax     Operating income, excluding noncontrolling interests   $   1,620   $   503   $   1,117       $   2,868   $   985   $   1,883     Noncontrolling interest                       (4)                           10     Operating income, net of noncontrolling interests   $   1,620   $   503   $   1,113       $   2,868   $   985   $   1,893     Uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments               (63)       63                   (49)       49     Deferred income tax valuation allowance releases (charges)               35       (35)                   (40)       40     Changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits       120       42       78           (87)       (30)       (57)     Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized                                                         capital gains (losses)       (64)       (22)       (42)           (28)       (10)       (18)     Other (income) expense -

Net income attributable to AIG decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in income from insurance operations, reflecting lower underwriting income, decreased net investment income, lower income on assets held by AIG Parent and lower net realized capital gains, partially offset by lower loss on extinguishment of debt. After-tax operating income attributable to AIG decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in income from insurance operations, reflecting lower underwriting income, decreased net investment income, and lower income on assets held by AIG Parent. For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 31.0 percent and 26.7 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate of 35 percent included tax benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, certain tax benefits associated with an agreement reached with the IRS related to certain tax issues under audit and the impact of other discrete tax benefits. For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 34.3 percent and 33.5 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.

In addition, other-than temporary impairment charges decreased due to an impairment charge on our previously held Aercap investment recognized in the second quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by: • a decrease in Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income due to lower net investment income, reflecting lower income on alternative investment and fair market value declines on assets accounted for under the fair value option, as well as an underwriting loss in Property Casualty compared to underwriting income in the same period in the prior year, partially offset by higher underwriting income in Mortgage Guaranty; • a net decrease of $246 million in consolidated pre-tax income related to guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, primarily due to movement in the non-performance or “own credit” spread adjustment (NPA) component of the embedded derivative fair value measurement (see Insurance Reserves – Life Insurance Companies – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefit Features and Hedging Program);      100       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      • a decrease in Corporate and Other pre-tax operating results, primarily due to lower earnings on investments for which the fair value option was elected, including ABS CDOs and part of our PICC Investment, as well as the absence of equity earnings from shares in AerCap, which was divested in 2015. Additionally, Run-off insurance lines reported a pre-tax operating loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a pre-tax operating income in the same period in the prior year. The pre-tax operating loss in Run-off insurance lines was driven by a charge for the discount on excess workers’ compensation reserves in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit in the same period in the prior year, largely driven by interest rate movements; and  • restructuring and other costs incurred in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 but not in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015.  YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME COMPARISON FOR 2016 AND 2015         Pre-tax results decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to: • a decrease in Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income due to lower net investment income, reflecting lower income on alternative investments and fair market value declines on assets accounted for under the fair value option, as well as lower underwriting income from Property Casualty, partially offset by increases in underwriting income from Mortgage Guaranty; • a decrease in Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income, primarily due to lower net investment income, reflecting lower income on alternative investments, partially offset by favorable mortality experience in Life, lower domestic general operating expenses in Retirement and Life, and improved underwriting results in Personal Insurance due to lower accident year losses, more favorable net prior year development and strategic actions to reduce general operating expenses and refocus direct marketing activities; • a loss in Corporate and Other pre-tax operating results, primarily due to lower earnings on investments for which the fair value option was elected, including ABS CDOs and part of our PICC Investment, as well as the absence of equity earnings from shares in AerCap, which was divested in 2015. Additionally, Run-off insurance lines reported a pre-tax operating loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a pre-tax operating income in the same period in the prior year. The pre-tax operating loss in Run-off insurance lines was driven by a charge for the discount on excess workers’ compensation reserves in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit in the same period in the prior year, largely driven by interest rate movements. These declines were partially offset by lower interest expense from ongoing liability management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources;  • net realized capital losses due primarily to foreign exchange losses compared to net realized gains due to foreign exchange gains and the sale of Class B shares of Prudential Financial Inc. in the same period in the prior year;  • a net decrease of $317 million to consolidated pre-tax income related to guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, primarily due to movement in the NPA component of the embedded derivative fair value measurement (see Insurance Reserves – Life Insurance Companies – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefit Features and Hedging Program); and • restructuring and other costs incurred in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 but not in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015.  These decreases were partially offset by lower loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing liability management activities and higher income from divested businesses.     101       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Net Investment Income         Net investment income is attributed to the operating segments of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses. For Commercial Insurance — Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance — Personal Insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The net investment income allocation is calculated based on these estimated investable funds consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the capital allocation for each operating segment. For Commercial Insurance — Institutional Markets, Consumer Insurance — Retirement and Consumer Insurance — Life, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life Insurance Companies. The fundamental investment strategy for these product line portfolios is to maintain primarily a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities and, to the extent practicable, to approximately match established duration targets based on characteristics of the underlying liabilities. All invested assets of the Life Insurance Companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on internal estimates of target statutory capital for each product line. Foreign Currency Impact         Property Casualty, International Life and Personal Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the currencies that have the most significant impact on our businesses:         Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage            June 30,       Percentage          Rate for 1 USD *   2016   2015       Change           2016   2015       Change         Currency:                                                 JPY   110.47   120.19       (8)   %       114.31   119.51       (4)   %     EUR   0.89   0.91       (2)   %       0.90   0.88       2   %     GBP   0.70   0.66       6   %       0.70   0.66       6   %    * For the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, foreign currency rates are based on the fiscal quarterly weighted average rate for the three-month period ended May 31, 2016.

These underwriting results were primarily driven by: • a net loss reserve discount charge in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss reserve discount benefit for the same period in the prior year; • higher catastrophe losses compared to the same period in the prior year;     104       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      • lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development in the current year which reflected approximately $100 million reserve charge attributable to Florida court rulings in the second quarter of 2016 that have increased the potential liability for workers’ compensation claims in that state by reversing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003; • improvements in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, from our strategic actions to retain more profitable business; and  • lower general operating expenses resulting from lower employee-related expenses and our expense savings initiatives.  The current accident year losses for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 included four severe losses totaling $130 million compared to eight severe losses totaling $184 million in the same period in the prior year. The net loss reserve discount charge was $191 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss reserve discount benefit of $270 million in the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the reserve discount curve consisting of consisting of the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve and a liquidity margin. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including return premiums, was $58 million and $279 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies –Net Loss Development for further discussion. Catastrophe losses were $353 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to $209 million in the same period in the prior year. Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net commission expense, particularly in Casualty and Specialty, reflecting lower production, the effect of reinsurance arrangements, as well as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound. These decreases were partially offset by higher guaranty fund and other assessments primarily due to favorable guaranty fund and other assessment settlements in the prior year period. General operating expenses decreased  in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses resulting from actions to streamline our management structure and general cost containment measures commenced in 2015 and continuing through June 30, 2016. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments as well as fair market value declines on assets accounted for under the fair value option. In the same period in the prior year, Property Casualty recorded net investment income related to assets accounted for under the fair value option. See MD&A — Investments for additional information on the Non-Life Insurance Companies invested assets, investment strategy, and asset-liability management process. Property Casualty Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower net investment income driven by lower returns on alternative investments and a decrease in underwriting income. The decrease in underwriting income was primarily driven by: • a net loss reserve discount charge in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss reserve discount benefit for the same period in the prior year; • higher catastrophe losses compared to the same period in the prior year; • lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development in the current year which reflected approximately $100 million reserve charge attributable to Florida court rulings in the second quarter of 2016 that have increased the potential liability for workers’ compensation claims in that state by reversing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003; • improvements in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, from our strategic actions to retain more profitable business; and  • lower general operating expenses resulting from lower employee-related expenses and our expense savings. Initiatives.  The current accident year losses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 included ten severe losses totaling $239 million compared to 16 severe losses totaling $318 million in the same period in the prior year. The net loss reserve discount      105       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      charge was $165 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to a benefit of $177 million in the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the reserve discount curve consisting of the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve and a liquidity margin. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including return premiums, was $48 million and $307 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Net Loss Development for further discussion. Catastrophe losses were $575 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to $280 million in the same period in the prior year. Acquisition expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net commission expense, particularly in Casualty, reflecting lower production, the effect of reinsurance arrangements, as well as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and British pound. These decreases were partially offset by higher guaranty fund and other assessments primarily due to favorable guaranty fund and other assessment settlements in the prior year period. General operating expenses decreased  in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses resulting from actions to streamline our management structure and general cost containment measures commenced in 2015 and continuing through 2016.

This decrease was primarily due to the continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection in our Casualty and Property product portfolios, the non-renewal of certain underperforming classes of business, the increased use of reinsurance and adherence to our underwriting discipline in competitive market conditions, as well as the effect of foreign exchange, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound. Additionally, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net premiums written benefited from the renewal of a multi-year E&O policy in U.S. Financial lines. The following paragraphs discuss the changes within our lines of business exclusive of the effect of foreign exchange.  Casualty net premiums written decreased, particularly in the U.S., in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting the continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection and to optimize our product portfolio, which includes non-renewal of certain underperforming classes of business, revising rates, terms and conditions in certain underperforming portfolios, and the effect of the two-year reinsurance arrangement with the Swiss Re Group.  Property net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower renewal retention and decreases in new business across all regions reflecting rate pressure and the effort to adhere to our underwriting discipline, partially offset by changes to our catastrophe reinsurance programs to retain more favorable risks.  Specialty net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the execution of our strategy to restructure the U.S environmental business, which includes non-renewal of certain pollution legal liability business in the U.S. and Canada, increased use of reinsurance, and a decline in EMEA Aerospace.

The Americas net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the continued execution of our strategy to optimize our product portfolio in the Casualty and Environmental businesses, increased use of reinsurance, and lower new and renewal business in Property and Financial lines. These declines were partially offset by an increase in certain targeted growth products in Specialty. Additionally, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net premiums written benefited from the renewal of a multi-year E&O policy in U.S. Financial lines.     108       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower new and renewal business, particularly in Property, reflecting rate pressure and the effort to adhere to our underwriting discipline, partially offset by an increase in certain targeted growth products in Specialty. EMEA net premiums written decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting lower new and renewal business across all lines, particularly in Aerospace.

Property Casualty Underwriting Ratios           Our Commercial Property Casualty business experiences period-to-period volatility, which may affect observable trends in key metrics, particularly underwriting ratios, and makes it difficult to predict future results by extrapolating movements in these metrics from quarter-to-quarter. Future results should not be extrapolated based on quarter-to-quarter movements in these metrics. The following tables present the Property Casualty combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:        Three Months Ended               Six Months Ended                 June 30,       Increase       June 30,       Increase         2016       2015       (Decrease)       2016       2015       (Decrease)     Loss ratio   75.0       70.8       4.2       71.6       69.5       2.1     Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums   (7.5)       (4.1)       (3.4)       (6.1)       (2.8)       (3.3)     Prior year development net of premium adjustments   (1.0)       (5.3)       4.3       (0.3)       (2.9)       2.6     Net reserve discount benefit (charge)   (4.1)       5.2       (9.3)       (1.8)       1.7       (3.5)     Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted   62.4       66.6       (4.2)       63.4       65.5       (2.1)     Acquisition ratio   15.4       15.1       0.3       15.9       15.6       0.3     General operating expense ratio    11.7       12.9       (1.2)       12.1       12.8       (0.7)     Expense ratio   27.1       28.0       (0.9)       28.0       28.4       (0.4)     Combined ratio   102.1       98.8       3.3       99.6       97.9       1.7     Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums   (7.5)       (4.1)       (3.4)       (6.1)       (2.8)       (3.3)     Prior year development net of premium adjustments   (1.0)       (5.3)       4.3       (0.3)       (2.9)       2.6     Net reserve discount benefit (charge)   (4.1)       5.2       (9.3)       (1.8)       1.7       (3.5)     Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted   89.5       94.6       (5.1)       91.4       93.9       (2.5)          109       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE         property casualty ratios Three Months Ended June 30,     Six Months Ended June 30,                    See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies for further discussion of discounting of reserves and prior year development.     110       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      The following tables present Property Casualty’s accident year catastrophe and severe losses by region and number of events: Catastrophes (a)        # of       Asia                 (in millions)   Events   Americas   Pacific   EMEA       Total     Three Months Ended June 30, 2016                                         Natural catastrophes:                                         Flooding   2   $   37   $   -   $   46   $   83     Windstorms and hailstorms   4       117       8       1       126     Wildfire   1       51       -       10       61     Earthquakes   2       54       24       5       83     Total catastrophe-related charges   9   $   259   $   32   $   62   $   353     Three Months Ended June 30, 2015                                         Natural catastrophes:                                         Flooding   2   $   67   $   -   $   2   $   69     Windstorms and hailstorms   7       103       14       23       140     Total catastrophe-related charges   9   $   170   $   14   $   25   $   209     Six Months Ended June 30, 2016                                         Natural catastrophes:                                         Flooding   2   $   37   $   -   $   46   $   83     Windstorms and hailstorms   11       301       15       2       318     Wildfire   1       51       -       10       61     Earthquakes   2       54       24       5       83     Other events   1       -       -       30       30     Total catastrophe-related charges   17   $   443   $   39   $   93   $   575     Six Months Ended June 30, 2015                                         Natural catastrophes:                                         Flooding   2   $   67   $   -   $   2   $   69     Windstorms and hailstorms   8       174       14       23       211     Total catastrophe-related charges   10   $   241   $   14   $   25   $   280    (a) Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each.

The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, as well as a lower expense ratio. The loss ratio increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a net loss reserve discount charge compared to net loss reserve discount benefit in the same periods in the prior year and higher catastrophe losses. These increases were partially offset by an improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, as well as lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development.   The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection, improve underwriting discipline and manage exposures, including the use of reinsurance, and overall lower severe losses. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, improved in Casualty, reflecting the non-renewal of certain underperforming classes of business, as well as the effect of reinsurance. Financial lines improved across all regions due to our pricing discipline, and Specialty benefited from lower severe and attritional losses. These decreases were partially offset by higher attritional and severe losses in Property. Severe losses represented approximately 2.8 points and 2.6 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 3.6 points and 3.2 points, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The acquisition ratio increased by 0.3 points in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to favorable guaranty fund and other assessments settlements in the same periods in the prior year, partially offset by lower net commission expenses, particularly in U.S. Casualty and U.S Specialty, reflecting the effect of reinsurance arrangements.  The general operating expense ratio decreased by 1.2 points and 0.7 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs resulting from ongoing actions to streamline our management structure and general cost containment measures commenced in 2015 and continuing through June 30, 2016.     112       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Mortgage Guaranty Results         The following table presents Mortgage Guaranty results:        Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                         June 30,       Percentage           June 30,           Percentage         (dollars in millions)       2016       2015       Change               2016           2015           Change         Underwriting results:                                                                         Net premiums written   $   244   $   277       (12)   %       $   475       $   535           (11)   %     Increase in unearned premiums       (5)       (51)       90               (11)           (79)           86         Net premiums earned       239       226       6               464           456           2         Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred       25       44       (43)               67           102           (34)         Acquisition expenses:                                                                         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       9       7       29               16           14           14         Other acquisition expenses       12       13       (8)               25           28           (11)         Total acquisition expenses       21       20       5               41           42           (2)         General operating expenses       42       40       5               78           79           (1)         Underwriting income       151       122       24               278           233           19         Net investment income       36       35       3               72           69           4         Pre-tax operating income       187       157       19               350           302           16         Key metrics:                                                                         Prior year loss reserve development (favorable)/                                                                         unfavorable   $   (12)   $   (17)       (29)   %       $   (17)       $   (17)           -   %     Domestic first-lien:                                                                         New insurance written   $   12,985   $   15,190       (15)           $   21,812       $   25,732           (15)         Combined ratio       38.1       48.4                       41.7           50.9                     Primary risk in force                                   $   47,719       $   44,723           7         60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a)                                       2.9   %       3.6   %                 Domestic second-lien:                                                                         Risk in force(b)                                   $   359       $   426           (16)        (a) Based on number of policies.

The decline in net premiums written primarily reflected reductions in run-off business and in new insurance volume driven by the decline in mortgage refinances in 2016. Mortgage refinances were higher in 2015 due to lower mortgage interest rates in late 2014 and early 2015 resulting in a surge in refinancing activity. First-Lien Results First-lien pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in underwriting income. First-lien net premiums earned increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily from an increase in the policies in-force. First-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $16 million compared to the same period in the prior year driven by lower frequency and severity in new delinquencies and an increase in cure rates. The combined ratio decreased by 10.3 points to 38.1 points in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an improvement in overall underwriting results. Acquisition expenses increased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. General operating expenses decreased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in employee-related expenses compared to the same period in the prior year. Other Business Results Other business results include second-lien mortgage insurance, student loan insurance and non-domestic mortgage insurance operations. The Other business’ pre-tax operating income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 remained unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year at approximately $15 million as a decrease in net premiums earned was entirely offset by a decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses.       114       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Mortgage Guaranty Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in incurred losses from lower delinquency rates and higher cure rates. The decline in net premiums written primarily reflected lower new insurance written compared to the early part of 2015 when the housing market experienced increased refinancing activity. First-Lien Results First-lien pre-tax operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an increase in underwriting income. First-lien net premiums earned increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily from an increase in in-force policies. First-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $28 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decline in newly reported delinquencies and an increase in cure rates. The combined ratio decreased by 9.2 points to 41.7 points in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting an improvement in overall underwriting results. Acquisition expenses remained unchanged at $41 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, as reductions in expenses related to sales support activities were offset by amortization of deferred acquisition costs. General operating expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in employee-related expenses. Other Business Results The Other business’ pre-tax operating income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was approximately $28 million compared to $30 million in the same period in the prior year. The slight decrease in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a decrease in net premiums earned as these portfolios continued to run off, partially offset by a decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses. New Insurance Written on Domestic First-Lien Mortgage Loans         Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first-lien new insurance written was $13.0 billion and $21.8 billion in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $15.2 billion and $25.7 billion, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year, due to lower mortgage interest rates in late 2014 and early 2015 resulting in an increase in refinancing activity in early 2015.  Delinquency Inventory         The delinquency inventory for domestic first-lien business declined during the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of cures and paid claims exceeding the number of newly reported delinquencies. Mortgage Guaranty’s first-lien primary delinquency ratio at June 30, 2016 was 2.9 percent compared to 3.6 percent at June 30, 2015. Over the last several years, Mortgage Guaranty has experienced a decline in newly reported delinquencies and an increase in cure rates.     115       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      The following table provides a summary of activity in Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first lien delinquency inventory:    Six Months Ended June 30,                 (number of policies)    2016       2015*     Number of primary delinquencies at the beginning of the year   30,471       37,622     Newly reported   17,450       19,063     Cures   (16,944)       (19,487)     Claims paid   (3,209)       (4,429)     Other   (1,508)       (878)     Number of primary delinquencies at the end of the period   26,260       31,891    * In the second quarter of 2016, Mortgage Guaranty’s number of delinquent loans was revised to remove modified pool policies and reflect primary first-lien only policies. The prior period has been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Mortgage Guaranty Quarterly and Year-to-Date Underwriting Ratios         The following tables present the Mortgage Guaranty combined ratios based on GAAP data:        Three Months Ended               Six Months Ended                 June 30,       Increase       June 30,       Increase             2016       2015       (Decrease)           2016       2015       (Decrease)     Loss ratio       10.5       19.5       (9.0)           14.4       22.4       (8.0)     Acquisition ratio       8.8       8.8       -           8.8       9.2       (0.4)     General operating expense ratio       17.6       17.7       (0.1)           16.8       17.3       (0.5)     Expense ratio       26.4       26.5       (0.1)           25.6       26.5       (0.9)     Combined ratio       36.9       46.0       (9.1)           40.0       48.9       (8.9)    The combined ratio decreased by 9.1 points and 8.9 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a lower loss ratio. The decrease in the loss ratio in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 was driven primarily by a decline in incurred losses driven by fewer new delinquencies and higher cure rates. The acquisition ratio remained flat and decreased by 0.4 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the acquisition ratio decreased primarily due to reduced expenses related to sales activities supporting lower new insurance written. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.1 point and 0.5 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses.     116       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Institutional Markets Results         The following table presents Institutional Markets results:        Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2016       2015       Change               2016       2015       Change         Revenues:                                                                 Premiums   $   215   $   643       (67)   %       $   450   $   739       (39)   %     Policy fees       50       50       -               101       99       2         Net investment income       430       479       (10)               763       958       (20)         Benefits and expenses:                                                                 Policyholder benefits and losses incurred       457       891       (49)               938       1,240       (24)         Interest credited to policyholder account balances       101       102       (1)               202       204       (1)         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       -       -       NM               1       1       -         Other acquisition expenses       7       8       (13)               18       15       20         General operating expenses       20       20       -               39       38       3         Pre-tax operating income   $   110   $   151       (27)   %       $   116   $   298       (61)   %         INSTITUTIONAL MARKETS pre-tax OPERATING INCOME (in millions)               117       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Institutional Markets Quarterly Results  Pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income on alternative investments. Variances in premiums and benefits and expenses are primarily due to premiums received and future policy benefit reserves established from the sale of terminal funding annuities and structured settlements. The decreases in premiums and in benefits and expenses, compared to the same period in the prior year, were due to a large terminal funding annuity issued in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. Net investment income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments, which was positive in the current period but lower than the same period in the prior year. Base net investment income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in average base invested assets. Certain traditional long-duration products for which Institutional Markets does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as life-contingent structured settlements, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment.

General operating expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 were comparable to the same period in the prior year. Institutional Markets Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income on alternative investments. The decreases in premiums and benefits and expenses were primarily due to a large terminal funding annuity issued in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015.  Net investment income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments, partially offset by higher base net investment income, primarily due to growth in average invested assets. Base net investment income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, due to commercial mortgage loan prepayment income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 and growth in average base invested assets. See MD&A – Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Institutional Markets business. General operating expenses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 increased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense related to real estate of consolidated partnerships, which was more than offset by related investment income. Institutional Markets Premiums and Deposits         For Institutional Markets, premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent payout annuities or structured settlements. Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance and investment-type annuity contracts, including GICs and stable value wrap funding agreements.     118       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      The following table presents a reconciliation of Institutional Markets premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2016       2015           2016       2015     Premiums and deposits   $   506   $   680       $   810   $   826     Deposits       (288)       (26)           (349)       (71)     Other       (3)       (11)           (11)       (16)     Premiums    $   215   $   643       $   450   $   739    Premiums for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a large single premium for a terminal funding annuity issued in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in premiums was offset by an increase in deposits in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a $254 million ten-year, floating-rate funding agreement issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016.

The sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016 resulted in decreases in advisory fee income, advisory fee expense and general operating expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net investment income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to income on alternative investments, which was positive in the current period but lower than the same period in the prior year. Base net investment income was lower in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, due to lower reinvestment yields and lower accretion income, compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by higher yield enhancements, which included higher bond call and tender income and gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. Base net investment income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, and Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 declined compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows, which continued to be at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment, as well as additional accretion included in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in base net investment income due to lower yields was partially offset by growth in average invested assets due to positive net flows in the past twelve months. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business. In Group Retirement, lower base yields resulted in spread compression in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, as lower base net investment income due to lower yields and lower accretion income was only partially offset by lower average interest crediting rates. In Fixed Annuities, average crediting rates in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 were comparable to the same period in the prior year, and base spreads decreased slightly due to lower base yields. See Spread Management below for additional discussion.     121       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to decreases in employee-related expenses, as well as the sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016. General operating expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 also included interest expense related to real estate of consolidated partnerships, which was more than offset by related investment income. Retirement Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income on alternative investments, partially offset by lower general operating expenses due to lower employee-related expenses. DAC amortization was higher in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due in part to a higher level of amortization in Fixed Annuities resulting from the update of actuarial assumptions in the third quarter of 2015, and growth in Retirement Income Solutions index annuities. The sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016 resulted in decreases in advisory fee income, advisory fee expense and general operating expenses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net investment income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments, which included losses in the first three months of 2016, compared to a strong performance in alternative investments in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in alternative investment income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was partially offset by higher yield enhancement income, which included higher bond call and tender income, and higher base net investment income, compared to the same period in the prior year. Base net investment income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of commercial mortgage loan prepayment income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, which more than offset overall continued lower base yields on investment purchases. Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 declined compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and reinvestment of portfolio cash flows, which continued to be at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment. The decrease in base net investment income due to lower yields was partially offset by growth in average invested assets compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to positive net flows in the past twelve months. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business. In Group Retirement, base spreads decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to lower yields on reinvestment of portfolio cash flows and additional accretion in the same period in the prior year, partially offset by lower average interest crediting rates, which are reset annually on January 1 for a large portion of Group Retirement’s fixed option account values. In Fixed Annuities, average crediting rates in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 were comparable to the same period in the prior year, and base spreads decreased slightly due to lower base yields. See Spread Management below for additional discussion. General operating expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to decreases in employee-related expenses, as well as the sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016. General operating expenses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 also included interest expense related to real estate of consolidated partnerships, which was more than offset by related investment income.     122       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Spread Management The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the Life Insurance Companies’ asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. Disciplined pricing on new business and active crediting rate management are used in the Retirement operating segment to partially offset the impact of a continued decline in base yields resulting from investment of available cash flows in the low interest rate environment. Disciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of annuity products at targeted net investment spreads in the current rate environment. Retirement has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products that had higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. As a result, new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of one percent. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions in annuity products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Retirement will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields. In addition to deferred annuity products, certain traditional long-duration products for which Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. As of June 30, 2016, Retirement’s fixed annuity reserves, which include fixed options offered within variable annuities sold in the Group Retirement and Retirement Income Solutions product lines as well as reserves of the Fixed Annuities product line, had minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older in-force products. As indicated in the table below, approximately 72 percent of annuity account values were at their minimum crediting rates as of June 30, 2016, compared to 73 percent at December 31, 2015. As a result of disciplined pricing on new business and the run-off of older business with higher minimum crediting rates, fixed annuity account values having contractual minimum guaranteed rates above 1 percent decreased from 74 percent of total fixed annuity reserves at December 31, 2015 to 72 percent at June 30, 2016.

Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds. The following table presents a reconciliation of Retirement premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2016       2015           2016       2015     Premiums and deposits*   $   6,431   $   6,070       $   13,284   $   11,579     Deposits       (6,377)       (6,046)           (13,178)       (11,537)     Other       (2)       20           -       48     Premiums    $   52   $   44       $   106   $   90    * Excludes activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities. Premiums increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales of immediate annuities in the Fixed Annuities product line. Premiums and Deposits and Net Flows The following table presents Retirement premiums and deposits and net flows by product line:        Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2016       2015       Change               2016       2015       Change         Fixed Annuities   $   1,208   $   650       86   %       $   2,842   $   1,334       113   %     Retirement Income Solutions       1,976       2,936       (33)               4,014       5,393       (26)         Retail Mutual Funds       1,410       922       53               2,735       1,779       54         Group Retirement       1,837       1,562       18               3,693       3,073       20         Total Retirement premiums and deposits*   $   6,431   $   6,070       6   %       $   13,284   $   11,579       15   %             Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2016       2015           2016       2015     Net flows                                         Fixed Annuities   $   (428)   $   (940)       $   (269)   $   (1,686)     Retirement Income Solutions       1,061       1,922           2,258       3,447     Retail Mutual Funds       702       341           1,245       484     Group Retirement       19       (391)           54       (1,031)     Total Retirement net flows*   $   1,354   $   932       $   3,288   $   1,214    * Excludes activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities, which had reserves of approximately $4.3 billion and $5.2 billion at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     124       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE         RETIREMENT PREMIUMS AND DEPOSITS by Product Line (in millions)               Premiums and deposits for Retirement increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales in Fixed Annuities, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, partially offset by lower sales in Retirement Income Solutions. Net flows for annuity products included in Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows from mutual funds, which are included in both Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, represent deposits less withdrawals. Total net flows for Retirement in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year. Higher sales of Fixed Annuities, higher sales and lower surrenders in Group Retirement, and higher sales of Retail Mutual Funds were the primary drivers of the improvement in net flows compared to the same periods in the prior year. Premiums and Deposits and Net Flows by Product Line A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows: Fixed Annuities deposits increased significantly in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year, partially offset by a slight increase in surrenders, resulting in net flows that were negative but improved compared to the same periods in the prior year.     125       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Retirement Income Solutions premiums and deposits decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to lower sales of variable annuities, which were partially offset by growth in index annuities. Positive net flows exceeded $1 billion per quarter in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, but were significantly lower compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to the decrease in deposits. Surrenders were lower in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, and the improvement in surrender rates (see Surrender Rates below) also reflected the significant growth in account value driven by positive net flows over the past twelve months, which has increased the proportion of business that is within the surrender charge period. Retail Mutual Fund net flows increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to improvement in the level of deposits driven by activity within the Focused Dividend Strategy Fund. Group Retirement net flows in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 were positive and improved significantly compared to net outflows in the same periods in the prior year, due to higher premiums and deposits and lower surrender activity. The six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included large group surrenders of approximately $475 million. The large group market has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in our target markets.

The increase in DAC amortization was largely offset by higher amortization of unearned revenue reserves, reported in policy fees, and by reserve releases associated with increased lapses of term and traditional life products. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments, partially offset by higher yield enhancement income, which included bond call and tender income.

General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. A decrease in domestic employee-related expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was more than offset by higher expenses in Japan and interest expense related to real estate of consolidated partnerships; the latter was more than offset by related investment income. Life Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to lower net investment income on alternative investments and higher general operating expenses from international operations, partially offset by more favorable mortality experience, lower domestic employee-related expenses and an IBNR reserve release. Pre-tax operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 benefited from a $25 million reduction in the reserve for IBNR death claims related to enhanced claims practices, which was recorded in the three-month period ended March 31, 2016. The increase in DAC amortization was largely offset by higher amortization of unearned revenue reserves, reported in policy fees, and by reserve releases associated with increased lapses of term and traditional life products. Net investment income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower income on alternative investments, partially offset by higher yield enhancement income, which included bond call and tender income. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional discussion of the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Life business. General operating expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in international expenses from operations in Japan and Laya Healthcare, which was acquired on March 31, 2015, as well as interest expense related to real estate of consolidated partnerships; the latter was more than offset by related investment income. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in domestic operating expenses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year, principally driven by lower employee-related expenses. Spread Management         Disciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of life products at targeted net investment spreads in the current interest rate environment. Life has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Life cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates, as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally two to three percent on new non-indexed products and zero to two percent on new indexed products, and are designed to meet targeted net investment spreads. In-force Management. Crediting rates for in-force policies are adjusted in accordance with contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees.     128       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      The following table presents universal life account values by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates:        Current Crediting Rates     June 30, 2016           1-50 Basis   More than 50                 Contractual Minimum Guaranteed    At Contractual   Points Above   Basis Points                 Interest Rate   Minimum   Minimum   Above Minimum                 (in millions)   Guarantee   Guarantee   Guarantee       Total         Universal life insurance                                         1%   $   -   $   -   $   7   $   7         > 1% - 2%       31       168       237       436         > 2% - 3%       528       309       1,476       2,313         > 3% - 4%       1,996       492       1,063       3,551         > 4% - 5%       3,846       205       -       4,051         > 5% - 5.5%       322       -       -       322         Total   $   6,723   $   1,174   $   2,783   $   10,680         Percentage of total       63   %   11   %   26   %   100   %    Life Premiums and Deposits         Premiums for Life represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and group benefit policies.

The growth in premiums resulted in growth in premiums and deposits of 5 percent and 4 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.     129       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Personal Insurance Results         The following table presents Personal Insurance results:        Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2016       2015       Change               2016       2015       Change         Underwriting results:                                                                 Net premiums written   $   2,922   $   2,930       -   %       $   5,734   $   5,845       (2)   %     Increase in unearned premiums       (60)       (124)       52               (102)       (240)       58         Net premiums earned       2,862       2,806       2               5,632       5,605       -         Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred       1,593       1,480       8               3,047       3,125       (2)         Acquisition expenses:                                                                 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       507       490       3               987       977       1         Other acquisition expenses       233       294       (21)               475       572       (17)         Total acquisition expenses       740       784       (6)               1,462       1,549       (6)         General operating expenses       403       535       (25)               826       1,013       (18)         Underwriting income (loss)       126       7       NM               297       (82)       NM         Net investment income       53       63       (16)               104       126       (17)         Pre-tax operating income   $   179   $   70       156   %       $   401   $   44       NM   %         NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN (in millions)        Pre-Tax oPERATING INCOME (in millions)                       Personal Insurance Quarterly Results Pre‑tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to improved underwriting results. The underwriting results reflected strategic actions to reduce expenses and refocus direct marketing activities, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and a single large loss event, as discussed below, in the current quarter. Net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $39 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to $17 million in the same period in the prior year. Catastrophe losses were $59 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to $16 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in non-deferred direct marketing expenses. The non-deferred direct marketing expenses, excluding      130       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      commissions, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, were approximately $32 million, and decreased by approximately $48 million from the same period in the prior year. General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses arising from organization realignment activities together with lower strategic investment expenditures and the effect of foreign exchange. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, partially offset by higher interest income.

Net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $87 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to $13 million in the same period in the prior year. Catastrophe losses were $88 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to $77 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in non-deferred direct marketing expenses and the effect of foreign exchange.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year. Personal Insurance net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the effect of foreign exchange. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written remained unchanged. The following paragraphs discuss the changes in net premiums written on a constant dollar basis, which excludes the effect of foreign exchange. Accident and Health net premiums written decreased slightly in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to continued underwriting discipline across our businesses together with lower sales as a result of refocusing our direct marketing activities.  Personal Lines net premiums written decreased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year as decreases in the automobile and personal property businesses were partially offset by an increase in warranty service programs particularly in the U.S. The increase in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was due to an increase in personal property business in the U.S. and Asia Pacific outside of Japan and in the automobile business in the Americas partially offset by decreased production in personal property in Japan due to a duration restriction on long-term fire insurance put in place in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in the U.S. personal property business in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was attributable to new business sales in the AIG Private Client Group including changes to optimize our reinsurance structure to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure.      132       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region         The following table presents Personal Insurance net premiums written by region:        Three Months Ended       Percentage           Percentage           Six Months Ended       Percentage       Percentage             June 30,       Change in           Change in           June 30,       Change in       Change in         (in millions)       2016       2015       U.S. dollars           Original Currency               2016       2015       U.S. dollars           Original Currency         Americas   $   981   $   947       4   %       8   %       $   1,933   $   1,859       4   %       9   %     Asia Pacific       1,522       1,539       (1)           (5)               2,850       2,969       (4)           (4)         EMEA       419       444       (6)           (5)               951       1,017       (6)           (2)         Total net premiums written   $   2,922   $   2,930       -   %       (1)   %       $   5,734   $   5,845       (2)   %       -   %         Personal insurance NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN by Region   (in millions)      The following paragraphs discuss the changes in net premiums written on a constant dollar basis, which exclude the effect of foreign exchange. Americas net premiums written increased across all lines in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to personal property and automobile businesses and the reinsurance optimization discussed above, partially offset by a small decrease in Accident and Health business. Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to decreased production in personal property reflecting the long-term fire insurance duration restriction in Japan discussed above. EMEA net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in both Accident and Health and Personal lines.     133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Personal Insurance Underwriting Ratios         The following tables present the Personal Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:        Three Months Ended               Six Months Ended                 June 30,       Increase       June 30,       Increase         2016       2015       (Decrease)       2016       2015       (Decrease)     Loss ratio   55.7       52.7       3.0       54.1       55.8       (1.7)     Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums   (2.1)       (0.5)       (1.6)       (1.6)       (1.4)       (0.2)     Prior year development net of premium adjustments   1.4       0.6       0.8       1.6       0.2       1.4     Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted   55.0       52.8       2.2       54.1       54.6       (0.5)     Acquisition ratio   25.9       27.9       (2.0)       26.0       27.6       (1.6)     General operating expense ratio    14.1       19.1       (5.0)       14.7       18.1       (3.4)     Expense ratio   40.0       47.0       (7.0)       40.7       45.7       (5.0)     Combined ratio   95.7       99.7       (4.0)       94.8       101.5       (6.7)     Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums   (2.1)       (0.5)       (1.6)       (1.6)       (1.4)       (0.2)     Prior year development net of premium adjustments   1.4       0.6       0.8       1.6       0.2       1.4     Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted   95.0       99.8       (4.8)       94.8       100.3       (5.5)         Personal Insurance ratios  Three Months Ended June 30,     Six Months Ended June 30,                  134       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE                The following tables present Personal Insurance accident year catastrophe and severe losses by region and the number of events: Catastrophes (a)        # of       Asia                 (in millions)   Events   Americas   Pacific   EMEA       Total     Three Months Ended June 30, 2016                                         Flooding   2   $   3   $   -   $   2   $   5     Windstorms and hailstorms   3       10       (2)       -       8     Earthquakes   2       24       22       -       46     Total catastrophe-related charges   7   $   37   $   20   $   2   $   59     Three Months Ended June 30, 2015                                         Flooding   2   $   4   $   -   $   -   $   4     Windstorms and hailstorms   6       12       -       -       12     Total catastrophe-related charges   8   $   16   $   -   $   -   $   16     Six Months Ended June 30, 2016                                         Flooding   2   $   3   $   -   $   2   $   5     Windstorms and hailstorms   10       32       5       -       37     Earthquakes   2       24       22       -       46     Total catastrophe-related charges   14   $   59   $   27   $   2   $   88     Six Months Ended June 30, 2015                                         Flooding   2   $   4   $   -   $   -   $   4     Windstorms and hailstorms   7       73       -       -       73     Total catastrophe-related charges   9   $   77   $   -   $   -   $   77    (a) Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each.

Personal Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Insurance Ratios The combined ratio decreased by 4.0 points and 6.7 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting an improvement in the expense ratio. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 4.8 points and 5.5 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to improvement in the expense ratio. The loss ratio increased by 3.0 points in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase reflected higher catastrophe losses and accident year losses, offset by net favorable prior year loss reserve development. The decrease in the loss ratio by 1.7 points in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher net favorable prior year loss reserve development. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 2.2 points in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a single large loss event which totaled $33 million, of which $16 million was related to first party losses (meeting the definition of severe losses) and $17 million was related to third party losses, impacting the personal property business in the U.S. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 0.5 points in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to improved performance in warranty service programs and personal property.  The acquisition ratio decreased by 2.0 points and 1.6 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, which reflected lower Accident and Health direct marketing expenses as we refocused our activities. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 5.0 points and 3.4 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses arising from organization realignment activities together with lower strategic investment expenditures.        136       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CORPORATE AND OTHER      CORPORATE AND OTHER         Corporate and Other Results         The following table presents AIG’s Corporate and Other results:        Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         (in millions)       2016       2015       Change               2016       2015       Change         Corporate and Other pre-tax operating income (loss):                                                                 Equity in pre-tax operating earnings of AerCap(a)   $   -   $   127       NM   %       $   -   $   255       NM   %     Fair value of PICC Investment(b)       (44)       170       NM               (119)       217       NM         Income from other assets, net(c)       215       509       (58)               77       1,073       (93)         Corporate general operating expenses       (289)       (268)       (8)               (583)       (520)       (12)         Interest expense       (261)       (278)       6               (518)       (583)       11         Run-off insurance Lines       (164)       110       NM               (133)       91       NM         Consolidation and eliminations       (1)       2       NM               (1)       1       NM         Total Corporate and Other pre-tax operating income (loss)   $   (544)   $   372       NM   %       $   (1,277)   $   534       NM   %    (a) Represents our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income, which excludes certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft. (b) During the first quarter of 2015, Non-Life Insurance Companies sold a portion of their PICC Investment to AIG Parent.  (c) Consists of the results of investments held by AIG Parent to support various corporate needs as well as the remaining positions of AIGFP, life settlements, real estate, equipment leasing and lending and other secured lending investments held by AIG Parent and certain subsidiaries. Corporate and Other Quarterly Results Corporate and Other reported a pre-tax operating loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to pre-tax operating income in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in Income from other assets, net. Income from other assets, net, decreased primarily due to lower fair value gains on ABS CDOs and lower credit valuation adjustments on assets for which the fair value option was elected.  The pre-tax operating results also reflected fair value losses on our PICC Investment compared to fair value gains in the same period in the prior year. In addition, the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 included our share of AerCap’s pre-tax income, which was accounted for under the equity method through the date of sale of most of our shares in the second quarter of 2015.  The underwriting loss in run-off insurance lines for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was driven by a charge for the discount on excess workers’ compensation reserves, compared to a benefit in the comparable prior year quarter, largely driven by interest rate movements. In addition, the underwriting loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included an $86 million out of period charge to reduce earned premium related to the substantiation of an opening balance brought forward from an earlier ledger conversion initiative prior to 2011. The inclusion of this adjustment in Corporate and Other is consistent with how our results of operations are reported to our chief operating decision makers.      137       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CORPORATE AND OTHER      Corporate and Other Year-to-Date Results Corporate and Other reported a pre-tax operating loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to pre-tax operating income in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in Income from other assets, net. Income from other assets, net decreased primarily due to lower fair value gains on ABS CDOs and lower credit valuation adjustments on assets for which the fair value option was elected and gains recognized in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 upon the unwinding of certain positions. The pre-tax operating results also reflected fair value losses on our PICC Investment compared to fair value gains in the same period in the prior year. In addition, the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included our share of AerCap’s pre-tax income, which was accounted for under the equity method through the date of sale of most of our shares in the second quarter of 2015. These declines were partially offset by lower interest expense from ongoing liability management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Run-off insurance lines reported a pre-tax operating loss of $131 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to pre-tax operating income of $91 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to underwriting losses during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to underwriting income in the same period in the prior year, as well as an increase in the allocation of net investment income. The decrease in underwriting results primarily reflected: · excess workers’ compensation net loss reserve discount charges in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit in the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the reserve discount curve consisting of Treasury rates partially offset by an increase in credit spreads. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion;   · higher accident year losses, primarily reflecting the transfers of certain casualty lines, including environmental liability, excess casualty and healthcare coverage that ceased to be offered by Commercial Insurance; and · lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development. In addition, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the underwriting loss included an $86 million out of period charge that reduced earned premium discussed above.      138       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS          INVESTMENTS    Overview         Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for Non-Life Insurance Companies, Life Insurance Companies and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.    Investments Highlights during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016     • A decline in interest rates resulted in an increase in our net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $18.0 billion as of June 30, 2016 from approximately $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • Our alternative investments portfolio performance experienced a significant decline in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased volatility in equity markets, which affected the performance of our hedge fund portfolio primarily in the first quarter of 2016. During the six-months ended June 30, 2016, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $1.4 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  • Other-than-temporary impairments increased slightly due to higher impairments within the energy sector and in our structured securities portfolio. • We recognized gains on sales of securities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment. • The recent Brexit vote has created increased volatility in exchange rates as well as within the equity markets, which may continue for some time.      Investment Strategies         Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Non-Life Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.     139       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Non-Life Insurance Companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  • While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.  • AIG Parent, included in Corporate and Other, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. Investments by Legal Entity Category         The following tables summarize the composition of AIG's investments:            Non-Life       Life                                 Insurance       Insurance       Corporate                 (in millions)       Companies       Companies       and Other(b)           Total     June 30, 2016                                         Fixed maturity securities(a):                                         Bonds available for sale, at fair value   $   87,657   $   169,237   $   5,195       $   262,089     Other bond securities, at fair value       1,301       3,834       10,200           15,335     Equity securities:                                         Common and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value       1,954       156       (468)           1,642     Other Common and preferred stock, at fair value       189       2       470           661     Mortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance       8,834       24,768       (2,341)           31,261     Other invested assets       10,314       10,535       6,496           27,345     Short-term investments       4,240       4,680       3,414           12,334     Total investments       114,489       213,212       22,966           350,667     Cash       1,211       482       91           1,784     Total invested assets   $   115,700   $   213,694   $   23,057       $   352,451     December 31, 2015                                         Fixed maturity securities(a):                                         Bonds available for sale, at fair value   $   84,849   $   157,150   $   6,246       $   248,245     Other bond securities, at fair value       1,463       3,589       11,730           16,782     Equity securities:                                         Common and preferred stock available for sale, at fair value       2,821       144       (50)           2,915     Other Common and preferred stock, at fair value       355       -       566           921     Mortgage and other loans receivable, net of allowance       8,278       23,979       (2,692)           29,565     Other invested assets       10,571       12,398       6,825           29,794     Short-term investments       3,189       2,877       4,066           10,132     Total investments       111,526       200,137       26,691           338,354     Cash       1,011       557       61           1,629     Total invested assets   $   112,537   $   200,694   $   26,752       $   339,983    (a) At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 90 percent and 10 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities, respectively.

Prior period disclosures have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date. Other hedge funds are generally reported on a one-month lag, while private equity funds are generally reported on a one-quarter lag.  (b) Includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge interest rate and other risks related to our variable annuity guaranteed living benefits. For the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $120 million and $(87) million, respectively. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $253 million and $(43) million, respectively. Net investment income decreased for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected. Net investment income decreased for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to negative performance in hedge funds, and lower reinvestment yields, partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected.  Non-Life Insurance Companies         For the Non-Life Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Non-Life Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The Non-Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Non-Life Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.  Fixed maturity investments of the Non-Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with a duration of 4.7 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.     141       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      Fixed maturity investments held in the Non-Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings with a duration averaging 3.4 years. Life Insurance Companies         The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life Insurance Companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.  The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies, we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.  The Life Insurance Companies monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. The Life Insurance Companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. Fixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with a duration of 6.8 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings. Fixed maturity investments held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings with a duration averaging 15.3 years. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities         The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to      142       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of Life Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments – Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings. The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of Life Insurance Companies categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:    June 30, 2016                                                                                 (in millions)                                                                                                                                                 Total                                     Total                                           Below                                     Investment                                           Investment             NAIC Designation       1       2       Grade           3       4       5       6       Grade       Total     Other fixed maturity securities   $   48,707   $   59,795   $   108,502       $   5,898   $   3,202   $   606   $   137   $   9,843   $   118,345     Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized       45,670       2,328       47,998           276       222       74       842       1,414       49,412     Total*   $   94,377   $   62,123   $   156,500       $   6,174   $   3,424   $   680   $   979   $   11,257   $   167,757     * Excludes $5.3 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are held in legal entities within Life Insurance Companies that do not require a statutory filing.

Credit Ratings         At June 30, 2016, approximately 90 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. A significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2016, approximately 16 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 7 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 47 percent of the      143       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Composite AIG Credit Ratings         With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements.     156       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $219 million and $180 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $458 million and $368 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Report for a discussion of our other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy.

Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments          The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $9.2 billion due to a decrease in interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads. The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the second quarter of 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net unrealized gains      157       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $4.5 billion due to an increase in interest rates and widening of credit spreads.

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses         The following table presents the components of Net realized capital gains (losses):        Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2016       2015           2016           2015     Sales of fixed maturity securities   $   124   $   135       $   (238)       $   166     Sales of equity securities       974       21           998           512     Other-than-temporary impairments:                                             Severity       (3)       -           (5)           (2)     Change in intent       (4)       (88)           (33)           (112)     Foreign currency declines       (1)       (3)           (7)           (32)     Issuer-specific credit events       (95)       (70)           (226)           (138)     Adverse projected cash flows       (5)       (3)           (41)           (8)     Provision for loan losses       (30)       (13)           -           11     Foreign exchange transactions       (38)       66           (558)           320     Derivatives and hedge accounting       170       288           97           496     Impairments on investments in life settlements       (92)       (72)           (249)           (142)     Other*       42       (135)           198           396     Net realized capital gains (losses)   $   1,042   $   126       $   (64)       $   1,467    * Includes $107 million of realized gains due to a purchase price adjustment on the sale of Class B shares of Prudential Financial Inc. for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and $357 million of realized gains due to the sale of common shares of SpringLeaf Holdings, $428 million of realized gains due to the sale of Class B shares of Prudential Financial Inc. and $463 million of realized losses due to the sale of ordinary shares of AerCap for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net realized capital gains on investments in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 were primarily driven by gains on the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment. Net realized capital losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 were primarily related to foreign exchange losses and impairments, which were slightly higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were primarily due to $105 million of remeasurement gains and $378 million of remeasurement losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, for a short term intercompany balance that was matched with available for sale investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in the same foreign currencies. Unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale investments were recorded in other comprehensive income resulting in an immaterial impact on our overall equity or book value per share from this arrangement.  The short-term intercompany liability and related available for sale securities described above relate to subsidiaries that are recognized on a reporting period that is different from our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements consistent with our accounting policy. Therefore, our results of operations through June 30, 2016 do not include effects of the foreign currency fluctuations for the month ended June 30, 2016 on the intercompany arrangement and related available for sale securities. As a result of the recent Brexit vote and its impact on foreign currency rates, we estimate that the foreign currency remeasurement loss on the intercompany liability through June 2016 amounted to approximately $460 million. Any remeasurement will be reported in Net realized capital gains (losses) for the third quarter of 2016. Such amount is predominantly economically offset by unrealized foreign currency other comprehensive income on available for sale securities. As a result, the impact of recent foreign currency fluctuations on such arrangement has resulted in an immaterial impact on our overall equity or book value per share. Net realized capital gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 were primarily driven by gains on sales of our PICC Investment, Class B shares of Prudential Financial, Inc., and common shares of Springleaf Holdings, Inc. and foreign exchange gains, which included $34 million and $155 million of gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30,      158       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      2015, respectively, related to the intercompany notional cash pooling arrangement, discussed above. These realized gains were partially offset by realized losses related to the sale of ordinary shares of AerCap.

Insurance Reserves    The following section provides discussion of insurance reserves for both the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies, including Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, which is reported in Corporate and Other.  Non-Life Insurance Companies         The following section provides discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the Non-Life Insurance Companies. The following table presents the components of AIG’s gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a U.S. statutory basis*:        June 30,   December 31,     (in millions)       2016       2015     Other liability occurrence (including asbestos and environmental)   $   24,057   $   24,856     Workers' compensation (net of discount)       15,348       14,978     Other liability claims made       13,132       14,006     Property       6,235       5,823     Auto liability       5,013       4,692     Accident and health       1,873       1,783     Products liability       1,644       1,681     Medical malpractice       1,495       1,603     Aircraft       1,283       1,286     Mortgage guaranty / credit       643       733     Other       3,420       3,501     Total   $   74,143   $   74,942     Total U.S. & Canada    $   57,504   $   58,890     Total International    $   16,639   $   16,052    * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the NAIC. Gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount. The Non-Life Insurance Companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pre‑tax operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. See MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Details of the Loss Reserving Process in the 2015 Annual Report. Net loss reserves represent gross loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance.     159       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      The following table presents the components of net loss reserves:                            June 30,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2016       2015     Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount                       $   77,000   $   78,090     Less: discount                           (2,857)       (3,148)     Gross loss reserves, net of discount, before reinsurance                           74,143       74,942     Less: reinsurance recoverable*                           (14,520)       (14,339)     Net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                       $   59,623   $   60,603    * Includes $1.8 billion of reinsurance recoverable under a retroactive reinsurance agreement at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $13.1 billion and $12.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (meaning, the policy attachment point is above high dollar amounts retained by the insured through self-insured retentions, deductibles, retrospective programs, or captive arrangements; each referred here generically as “deductibles”), primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business. With respect to the deductible portion of the claim the Non-Life Insurance Companies manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. The Non-Life Insurance Companies held collateral of approximately $9.6 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and assets in trusts.

New York rules generally do not permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves. Pennsylvania permits non-tabular discounting of IBNR and approved variable discount rates determined using risk-free rates based on the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin, applicable to IBNR and case reserves. Delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the Pennsylvania domiciled companies. The net decreases in workers’ compensation discount in the amounts of $299 million and $289 million, respectively, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the decrease in forward yield curve rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices. The decrease in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a $270 million and $281 million decrease in the loss reserve discount in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year periods, due to a decrease in both Treasury rates and credit spreads which generally decreased along the payout pattern horizon. In addition, there was a $62 million and $89 million reduction for accident years 2015 and prior for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for those periods. This decrease was partially offset by a $33 million and $81 million addition for newly established reserves for accident year 2016 in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The impact of changes in treasury rates and credit spreads on workers' compensation reserve discount generally is economically offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities backing these reserves      161       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      recorded in Other comprehensive income resulting in a modest impact on our overall equity and book value per common share. Quarterly Reserving Conclusion         AIG net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of June 30, 2016. While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our recorded loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of June 30, 2016. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Loss Development   Net Loss Development         In determining the loss development from prior accident years, we consider and evaluate inputs from many sources, including actual claims data, the performance of prior reserve estimates, observed industry trends, our internal peer review processes (including challenges and recommendations from our Enterprise Risk Management group) as well as the views of third party actuarial firms. We use these sources to improve our evaluation techniques and to analyze and assess the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business. Our analyses produce a range of indications from various methods, from which we select our best estimate. We analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the lower or higher than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business. In other cases, the lower or higher than expected emergence may result in a change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments in response to the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, in particular those related to complex, claims-related class action litigation and latent exposure claims.  In the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, the adverse prior year loss reserve development was $7 million, which was primarily driven by adverse development from Primary Workers’ compensation and other and domestic catastrophes, partially      163       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      offset by Property excluding catastrophes, both domestically and internationally, International Specialty lines, and International Consumer – Personal Insurance. During the second quarter of 2016, the Florida Supreme Court issued two separate rulings that have increased the potential liability for workers’ compensation claims in that state by undoing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003. The Castellanos ruling eliminated statutory caps on claimant attorney fees in certain cases, and the Westphal ruling eliminated the 104-week limitation on temporary total disability benefits. Also in the second quarter, the Florida Court of Appeals issued the Miles decision, declaring unconstitutional certain restrictions on claimant-paid attorney fees. We have evaluated the potential impact of these decisions on our loss reserves, and have recognized adverse prior year development for primary workers’ compensation in the current quarter of approximately $100 million. We are continuing to monitor the impact of these decisions, and may adjust our estimate as new facts and data emerge. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the favorable prior year loss reserve development was $59 million, which was primarily driven by favorable development from Property excluding catastrophes, both domestically and internationally, International Specialty lines, and International Consumer - Personal Insurance, partially offset by domestic catastrophes, as well as Primary Workers’ compensation and other resulting from the Florida court rulings described above. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, the adverse prior year loss reserve development was $317 million and $341 million, respectively, which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in Excess and Primary Casualty, as well as adverse development from Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and prior), and Run-off Environmental (1987 to 2004). This was partially offset by Property excluding catastrophes, both domestically and internationally. We recognized return premiums on loss sensitive business of $22 million and $28 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, which entirely offset favorable development in that business. We recognized return premiums on loss sensitive business of $12 million and $23 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, which entirely offset favorable development in that business.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves           Loss Reserve Estimates - Asbestos and Environmental         The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. As described more fully in the 2015 Annual Report, our reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive ground‑up and top-down analyses performed periodically. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, we increased our gross asbestos incurred losses by $3 million due to accretion of discount, while our net asbestos incurred losses increased by $1 million. For the same period, our gross and net environmental incurred losses remained unchanged. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, we increased our gross asbestos incurred losses by $14 million and our net asbestos reserves by $8 million due to minor changes in estimates, accretion of discount, and anticipated uncollectible reinsurance. For the same period, we increased our gross environmental incurred losses by $66 million and our net environmental reserves by $43 million to reflect the results of a top-down analysis of accident years 2004 and prior completed in the six-month ended June 30, 2015. In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, the Non-Life Insurance Companies also have asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non‑U.S. entities of $117 million gross and $91 million net as of June 30, 2016. The asbestos reserves relating to non‑U.S. risks written by non‑U.S. entities were $121 million gross and $93 million net as of December 31, 2015.     165       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:    As of or for the Six Months Ended June 30,       2016       2015     (in millions)   Gross       Net       Gross       Net     Asbestos:                                     Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                                     at beginning of year   $   3,595   $   446   $   4,117   $   388     Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance       -       -       -       100     Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:                                     Undiscounted       -       -       9       5     Change in discount       3       1       5       3     Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred       3       1       14       8     Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid       (325)       (122)       (332)       (193)     Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                                     at end of period   $   3,273   $   325   $   3,799   $   303     Environmental:                                     Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                                     at beginning of year   $   545   $   276   $   368   $   185     Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred       -       -       66       43     Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid       (13)       (9)       (21)       (17)     Other changes       -       -       -       6     Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                                     at end of period   $   532   $   267   $   413   $   217     Combined:                                     Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                                      at beginning of year   $   4,140   $   722   $   4,485   $   573     Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance       -       -       -       100     Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:                                     Undiscounted       -       -       75       48     Change in discount       3       1       5       3     Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred       3       1       80       51     Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid       (338)       (131)       (353)       (210)     Other changes       -       -       -       6     Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                                     at end of period   $   3,805   $   592   $   4,212   $   520    Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves         The following section provides discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance reserves for Life Insurance Companies. Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefit Features and Hedging Program Our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features, which include GMWB and GMAB. The liabilities for GMWB and GMAB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility. In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB and GMAB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatilities. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election. See      166       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      Enterprise Risk Management – Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Program in the 2015 Annual Report for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features. Impact on Quarterly and Year-to-Date Pre-tax Income Changes in the fair value of the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity securities used in the variable annuity hedging program, for which the fair value option has been elected, are excluded from pre-tax operating income of the Retirement operating segment. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to differences between the GAAP valuation of the embedded derivatives and the economic hedge target. The non-performance or “own credit” spread adjustment (NPA), which adjusts the rate used to discount projected benefit cash flows for the GAAP valuation of the embedded derivatives, is excluded from the economic hedge target. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. See Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target, below. The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives and related hedges:        Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2016       2015           2016       2015     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA   $   (467)   $   652       $   (1,380)   $   318     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio:                                         Fixed maturity securities       120       (87)           253       (43)     Interest rate derivative contracts       534       (462)           1,384       (85)     Equity derivative contracts       (163)       (26)           (300)       (137)     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio       491       (575)           1,337       (265)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA, net of hedging portfolio        24       77           (43)       53     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to NPA       (32)       161           123       344     Net impact on pre-tax income   $   (8)   $   238       $   80   $   397    Losses from the increase in the fair value of the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivative liabilities, excluding the NPA, were significantly offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedging portfolio in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the liabilities excluding the NPA was primarily due to decreases in market interest rates during the periods. As a result of corporate spreads tightening, the change in the NPA also increased the embedded derivative liabilities and contributed to the small negative net impact on pre-tax income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016. However, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the change in the NPA partially offset the increase in the liabilities, and contributed to the positive impact on pre-tax income, net of hedging. Increases in market interest rates and the impact of widening credit spreads on the NPA in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 resulted in decreases in the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivative liabilities during those periods, which were offset by hedging to a lesser extent than in the same periods in the current year, resulting in a net positive impact on consolidated pre-tax income in the periods ended June 30, 2015. The changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives, including the NPA, were significantly offset in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, and offset to a lesser extent in the same periods in the prior years, by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:     167       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      • Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. Effective June 30, 2015, we discontinued our U.S. Treasury bond interest rate hedging program and initiated a corporate bond hedging program, which is intended to provide the same capital efficiency as the previous U.S. Treasury bond hedging program. The three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 reflected increases in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program, due primarily to decreases in market interest rates, which partially offset the interest rate and credit spread-related increases in the embedded derivative liabilities. The three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 reflected decreases in the fair value of the U.S. Treasury bond hedging program due to increases in market interest rates, which partially offset the interest rate-related decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities. The change in the fair value of these bonds is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in gains in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 due to decreasing market interest rates, compared to losses in the prior year resulting from increasing market interest rates. • Losses from the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, were relatively higher in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to more favorable equity market returns. Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic drivers of the embedded derivatives. The economic hedge target differs from the GAAP valuation of the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives due to the following: • Rider fees are 100 percent included in the economic hedge target present value calculations; the GAAP valuation reflects those collected fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero; • Actuarial assumptions for GAAP are adjusted to remove explicit risk margins, including margins for policyholder behavior and fund basis risk, and use best estimate assumptions for the economic hedge target; and • NPA is excluded from the discount rates used for the economic hedge target. The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life Insurance Companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include: • Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative; • Realized volatility versus implied volatility;  • Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target related to items not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and • Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.     168       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in Life Insurance Companies DAC, including VOBA:    Six Months Ended June 30,                             (in millions)               2016       2015     Balance, beginning of year           $   8,467   $   7,258     Acquisition costs deferred               623       596     Amortization expense:                             Related to realized capital gains and losses               22       (64)     All other operating amortization               (568)       (476)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange               (1)       (19)     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments               (769)       363     Balance, end of period*           $   7,774   $   7,658    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $9.1 billion and $8.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing contracts for investment-oriented products are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products. DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). Shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC balance when market interest rates decline. In addition, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). Market interest rates decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. As a result, the Life Insurance Companies’ unrealized appreciation of investments in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 increased by $5.0 billion compared to December 31, 2015, which resulted in an increase in the shadow DAC offset and an increase in shadow loss reserves. Shadow loss reserves increased by $1.5 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.     169       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      Life Insurance Companies Reserves         The following table presents a rollforward of Life Insurance Companies’ insurance reserves, including separate accounts and mutual fund assets under management, by operating segment:        Three Months Ended           Six Months Ended         June 30,           June 30,     (in millions)       2016       2015               2016       2015     Institutional Markets:                                             Balance at beginning of period, gross   $   35,815   $   35,120           $   35,823   $   35,080     Premiums and deposits       506       680               810       826     Surrenders and withdrawals       (102)       (227)               (279)       (256)     Death and other contract benefits       (456)       (418)               (837)       (797)     Subtotal       (52)       35               (306)       (227)     Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of                                             policy fees       434       299               672       557     Cost of funds       101       102               202       204     Other reserve changes       (101)       (33)               (194)       (91)     Balance at end of period       36,197       35,523               36,197       35,523     Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments       1,382       314               1,382       314     Reinsurance ceded       (5)       (5)               (5)       (5)     Total insurance reserves   $   37,574   $   35,832           $   37,574   $   35,832     Retirement:                                             Balance at beginning of period, gross   $   212,542   $   207,679           $   208,333   $   204,627     Premiums and deposits       6,448       6,083               13,314       11,605     Surrenders and withdrawals       (4,198)       (4,240)               (8,277)       (8,666)     Death and other contract benefits       (1,041)       (1,041)               (2,004)       (1,968)     Subtotal       1,209       802               3,033       971     Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of                                             policy fees       2,142       (1,296)               3,736       892     Cost of funds       686       676               1,365       1,349     Other reserve changes       (2)       7               110       29     Balance at end of period       216,577       207,868               216,577       207,868     Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments        109       9               109       9     Reinsurance ceded       (358)       (364)               (358)       (364)     Total insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management   $   216,328   $   207,513           $   216,328   $   207,513          170       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES         Life:                                             Balance at beginning of period, gross   $   34,393   $   33,482           $   34,170   $   33,536     Premiums and deposits       1,292       1,249               2,528       2,472     Surrenders and withdrawals       (241)       (164)               (468)       (386)     Death and other contract benefits       (231)       (260)               (489)       (507)     Subtotal       820       825               1,571       1,579     Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of                                             policy fees       (241)       (186)               (419)       (328)     Cost of funds       121       122               243       246     Other reserve changes       (335)       (610)               (807)       (1,400)     Balance at end of period       34,758       33,633               34,758       33,633     Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments        -

It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations over a twelve-month period under a liquidity stress scenario. See Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement in the 2015 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources as was the case in 2008. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.        172       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES         Liquidity and Capital Resources Activity for the Six-Month Period Ended June 30, 2016     Sources • AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, AIG Parent received $2.9 billion in dividends and loan repayments from subsidiaries. Of this amount, $1.5 billion was dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $1.4 billion was dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies.  AIG Parent also received $1.6 billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, including $1.1 billion of such payments in the second quarter of 2016. The tax sharing payments may be subject to adjustment in future periods. The dividends and tax sharing payments from our Non-Life and Life Insurance Companies were funded, in part, by proceeds from the sale of 740 million ordinary H shares of PICC P&C for approximately $1.25 billion in May 2016 and by the sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016. · Debt Issuances In February 2016, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.300% Notes due 2021. In March 2016, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.900% Notes due 2026. In June 2016, we issued €750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.500% Notes due 2023. · Legacy Assets During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, we monetized approximately $2.2 billion of legacy assets.   Uses • Debt Reduction In March 2016, we repurchased, through a cash tender offer, approximately $736 million aggregate principal amount of certain notes and debentures issued or guaranteed by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $825 million. We also made other repurchases and repayments of approximately $2.2 billion during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $515 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. • Dividend  We paid a cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock during each of the first and second quarters of 2016.  • Repurchase of Common Stock(*) We repurchased approximately 113 million shares of AIG Common Stock during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.2 billion.  • Repurchase of Warrants We repurchased 15 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock during the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, for an aggregate purchase price of $263 million.  • AIG Parent Funding to Subsidiaries In January 2016, AIG Parent made a capital contribution of approximately $2.9 billion to our Non-Life Insurance Companies.       * Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan, from July 1 to August 2, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $698 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock. As of August 2, 2016, approximately $4.0 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization.      173       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash         The following table presents selected data from AIG's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:    Six Months Ended June 30,                             (in millions)               2016       2015     Sources:                             Net cash provided by operating activities           $   571   $   493     Net cash provided by changes in restricted cash                -        1,462       Net cash provided by (used in) other investing activities               (186)       3,824     Changes in policyholder contract balances               2,752       316     Issuance of long-term debt               6,688       2,774     Total sources               9,825       8,869     Uses:                              Change in restricted cash               (78)       -     Repayments of long-term debt               (2,919)       (3,701)     Purchases of AIG Common Stock               (6,248)       (3,743)     Net cash used in other financing activities               (463)       (1,212)     Total uses               (9,708)       (8,656)     Effect of exchange rate changes on cash               38       (34)     Increase in cash           $   155   $   179    The following table presents a summary of AIG’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:    Six Months Ended June 30,                                 (in millions)                   2016       2015     Summary:                                  Net cash provided by operating activities               $   571   $   493      Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                   (264)       5,286      Net cash used in financing activities                   (190)       (5,566)      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash                   38       (34)     Increase in cash                   155       179     Cash at beginning of year                   1,629       1,758     Change in cash of businesses held-for-sale                   -       -     Cash at end of period               $   1,784   $   1,937    Operating Cash Flow Activities         Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $650 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $760 million in the same period in the prior year. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $1.2 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, primarily attributable to a greater increase in Other assets and Other liabilities, net.     174       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Investing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash provided by investing activities in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included approximately $143 million and $204 million, respectively, of cash collateral received in connection with our Life Insurance Companies’ securities lending program. In addition, the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included approximately $3.7 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares of AerCap. Financing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash used in financing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 included: • approximately $713 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2016; • approximately $6.2 billion to repurchase approximately 113 million shares of AIG Common Stock;  • $263 million to repurchase 15 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $2.9 billion to repay long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included: • approximately $335 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2015; · approximately $3.7 billion to repurchase approximately 69 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and · approximately $3.7 billion to repay long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries         AIG Parent         As of June 30, 2016, AIG Parent had approximately $11.2 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales, repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. We generally manage capital flows between AIG Parent and its subsidiaries through internal, Board-approved policies and standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.      175       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that capital associated with businesses or investments that do not directly support our insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.  In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the capital resources available to support our insurance operations and business strategies, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, expectations for capital generation, rating agency expectations for capital, as well as regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital and capital distributions. In January 2016, AIG Parent made a capital contribution of approximately $2.9 billion to our Non-Life Insurance Companies as a result of our fourth quarter 2015 reserve strengthening. The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   June 30, 2016   December 31, 2015     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   1,970   $   3,497     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       4,719       5,723     Total AIG Parent liquidity       6,689       9,220     Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(c)       4,500       4,500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   11,189   $   13,720    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. (c) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see Credit Facilities below. Non-Life Insurance Companies         We expect that our Non-Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Each of our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, dividends, expenses, investments and collateral requirements. Our Non-Life Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.     176       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Certain Non-Life Insurance Companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs may be used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our Non-Life Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 billion and $0 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The outstanding borrowings are being used primarily for interest rate risk management purposes in connection with certain reinsurance arrangements, and the balances are expected to decline as underlying premiums are collected. AIG Parent and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL), a Non-Life Insurance Company, are parties to a $725 million letter of credit facility. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd’s of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd’s), is required to hold capital at Lloyd’s, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the facility, the entire FAL capital requirement of $640 million as of June 30, 2016, which supports the 2016 and 2017 years of account, was satisfied with a letter of credit in that amount issued under the facility. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Non-Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with its Mortgage Guaranty insurance company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to its board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of June 30, 2016, the minimum required capital for the CMA with the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 19 to 1.  In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $1.5 billion to AIG Parent in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities. The fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.  Life Insurance Companies         We expect that our Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Each of our Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income. The primary uses of liquidity are benefit claims, interest payments, surrenders, withdrawals, dividends, expenses, investments and collateral requirements. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, as we saw in 2008, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Certain of our U.S. Life Insurance Companies are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. Life Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of approximately $2 million at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     177       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Certain of our U.S. Life Insurance Companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our U.S. Life Insurance Companies had $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of securities subject to these agreements and $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of AGC Life Insurance Company at or above a specified minimum percentage of its projected NAIC Company Action Level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). As of June 30, 2016, the specified minimum percentage under this CMA was 250 percent. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, our U.S. Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $1.4 billion to AIG Parent in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. Credit Facilities         We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Five-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Five-Year Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in November 2020. As of June 30, 2016, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Five-Year Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Five-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Five-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.        178       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Contractual Obligations         The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:    June 30, 2016               Payments due by Period              Total       Remainder       2017-       2019-                     (in millions)       Payments        of 2016       2018       2020       2021       Thereafter     Insurance operations                                                     Loss reserves   $   77,000   $   9,733   $   25,482   $   14,064   $   4,665   $   23,056     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       240,598       7,748       28,262       25,817       12,268       166,503     Borrowings       982       -       -       118       223       641     Interest payments on borrowings       976       25       99       99       50       703     Other long-term obligations       8       2       3       2       1       -     Total   $   319,564   $   17,508   $   53,846   $   40,100   $   17,207   $   190,903     Other                                                      Borrowings   $   25,960   $   882   $   3,291   $   2,472   $   280   $   19,035     Interest payments on borrowings       16,138       534       2,131       1,891       839       10,743     Other long-term obligations       246       19       92       92       -       43     Total   $   42,344   $   1,435   $   5,514   $   4,455   $   1,119   $   29,821     Consolidated                                                     Loss reserves   $   77,000   $   9,733   $   25,482   $   14,064   $   4,665   $   23,056     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       240,598       7,748       28,262       25,817       12,268       166,503     Borrowings       26,942       882       3,291       2,590       503       19,676     Interest payments on borrowings       17,114       559       2,230       1,990       889       11,446     Other long-term obligations(a)       254       21       95       94       1       43     Total(b)   $   361,908   $   18,943   $   59,360   $   44,555   $   18,326   $   220,724    (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.5 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.  Loss Reserves         Loss reserves relate to our Non-Life Insurance Companies and represent future losses and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our Non-Life Insurance Companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities         Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life Insurance Companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts      179       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life Insurance Companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life Insurance Companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.  Borrowings         Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Includes a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $500 million between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility) scheduled to mature in May 2019. The AerCap Credit Facility permits loans for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility. (f) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining annual pension contribution for 2016 is expected to be approximately $17 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities          We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements         We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.       181       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Debt         The following table provides the rollforward of AIG’s total debt outstanding:            Balance at               Maturities       Effect of                   Balance at     Six Months Ended June 30, 2016       December 31,               and       Foreign       Other       June 30,     (in millions)       2015       Issuances   Repayments       Exchange       Changes           2016     Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                                         AIG general borrowings:                                                         Notes and bonds payable   $   17,047   $   3,832   $   (960)   $   (90)   $   10       $   19,839     Junior subordinated debt       1,327       -       (461)       (10)       5           861     AIG Japan Holdings Kabushiki Kaisha       106       223       -       12       -           341     AIGLH notes and bonds payable       284       -       (3)       -       -           281     AIGLH junior subordinated debt       420       -       (60)       -       -           360     Total AIG general borrowings       19,184       4,055       (1,484)       (88)       15           21,682     AIG borrowings supported by assets:(a)                                                         MIP notes payable       1,372       -       -       121       (16)           1,477     Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable       34       -       -       -       2           36     GIAs, at fair value       3,276       115       (260)       -       244   (b)       3,375     Notes and bonds payable, at fair value       394       119       (145)       -       4   (b)       372     Total AIG borrowings supported by assets       5,076       234       (405)       121       234           5,260     Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG       24,260       4,289       (1,889)       33       249           26,942     Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                                         Other subsidiaries' notes, bonds, loans and                                                         mortgages payable       2       2,035       (835)       -       -           1,202     Debt of consolidated investments(c)       4,987       364       (259)       15       78   (d)       5,185     Total debt not guaranteed by AIG       4,989       2,399       (1,094)       15       78           6,387     Total debt(e)   $   29,249   $   6,688   $   (2,983)   $   48   $   327       $   33,329    (a) AIG Parent guarantees all such debt, except for MIP notes payable and Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable, which are direct obligations of AIG Parent.

(c) Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.     184       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early. The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A.

Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock     On February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on March 28, 2016 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2016. On May 2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on June 27, 2016 to shareholders of record on June 13, 2016. On August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on September 29, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2016. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Report. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $3.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization on such date of approximately $4.0 billion. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us.  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately 113 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.2 billion pursuant to this authorization, and we repurchased 15 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $263 million pursuant to this authorization. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan, from July 1 to August 2, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $698 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.  Dividend Restrictions         Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Report for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries.      185       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT          ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT    Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview         We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring and reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2015 Annual Report. Credit Risk Management         Overview         Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.  See Investments – Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.      186       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Market Risk Management         Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Risk Identification         Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital. Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk: Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.  Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts. Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long‑term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit‑worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.     187       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.  Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio. Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels. Risk Measurement         Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis. In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.    We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:     Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities. Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets. Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses. Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.        188       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Market Risk Sensitivities         The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:        Balance Sheet Exposure               Balance Sheet Effect         June 30,       December 31,               June 30,       December 31,      (dollars in millions)       2016           2015                   2016           2015     Sensitivity factor                                    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves     Interest rate sensitive assets:                                                         Fixed maturity securities       273,754           260,689                   (16,273)           (14,549)     Mortgage and other loans receivable       23,802           18,878                   (1,333)           (1,092)     Preferred stock       19           20                   (2)           (1)     Total interest rate sensitive assets   $   297,575   (a)   $   279,587   (a)            $   (17,608)       $   (15,642)     Sensitivity factor                                    20% decline in stock prices and value of                                         alternative investments     Equity and alternative investments exposure:                                                         Hedge funds       8,293           10,917                   (1,659)           (2,183)     Private equity       6,680           7,233                   (1,336)           (1,447)     Real estate investments       7,340           6,579                   (1,468)           (1,316)     PICC Investment       600           2,239                   (120)           (448)     Common equity       1,680           1,574                   (336)           (315)     Aircraft asset investments       427           477                   (85)           (95)     Other investments       527           472                   (105)           (94)     Total equity and alternative investments                                                          exposure   $   25,547       $   29,491               $   (5,109)       $   (5,898)     Sensitivity factor                                    10% depreciation of all foreign currency                                          exchange rates against the U.S. dollar     Foreign currency-denominated net                                                           asset position:                                                          Japanese yen       2,274           1,745                   (227)           (174)      Euro       2,062           2,053                   (206)           (205)      Great Britain pound       1,991           2,158                   (199)           (216)      All other foreign currencies       3,579           4,703                   (359)           (471)     Total foreign currency-denominated net                                                          asset position(b)    $   9,906       $   10,659               $   (991)       $   (1,066)    (a) At June 30, 2016, the analysis covered $297.6 billion of $312.8 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $7.5 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $4.1 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2015, the analysis covered $279.6 billion of $298.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $10.7 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.  (b) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries.  Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at June 30, 2016, decreased by $753 million compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was mostly due to a $1.3 billion decrease in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the      189       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      sale of our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ PICC Investment, partially offset by a $529 million increase in our Japanese yen position, primarily resulting from unrealized appreciation of investments.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management         Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.  AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due. AIG liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow it to meet its obligations over a twelve month horizon consistent with its risk appetite. We maintain target levels for required liquidity and/or minimum coverage ratios expected to ensure that our short-term financial obligations are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements. Risk Identification         The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.  · Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs or cause us to realize losses exceeding our expectations.  · Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls. · Event Funding Risk: Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.  · Financing Risk: We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding. Risk Measurement         Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.     190       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT         We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:     Target Liquidity Range: Target Liquidity Range specifies the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a twelve month horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.  Coverage Ratios: Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of potential assets to be monetized is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.  Cash Flow Forecasts: Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon. Stress Testing: Coverage Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.    Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:     • income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset; • liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses; • reinsurance assets; • valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; • valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; • estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; • impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment; • liability for legal contingencies; and • fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.        191       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES      These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, you should read Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2015 Annual Report.      REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT    Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. On June 3, 2016, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) issued for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on enhanced prudential standards that would require insurer nonbank SIFIs, such as AIG, to comply with a corporate governance and risk-management standard and a liquidity risk management standard. These proposed standards build on the FRB’s current guidance for large financial institutions supervised by the FRB and have been tailored to insurance companies. We are reviewing the proposals and analyzing how our current practices compare to those required by the NPR. We anticipate that the NPR will attract industry comment. Under the NPR, after the FRB evaluates all comments and adopts a final rule, the insurer nonbank SIFIs would have at least twelve months to comply. On June 3, 2016, the FRB also released for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) outlining two conceptual insurance group capital frameworks that could apply to insurance groups supervised by the FRB—a building block approach, proposed for insurance institutions that are savings and loan holding companies or bank holding companies by virtue of owning depository institutions, and a consolidated approach for insurer nonbank SIFIs, such as AIG. In general, the consolidated approach would consolidate an insurance company’s assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments tailored to account for the liability structure and unique features of the insurance company, apply risk factors to each segment and then set minimum capital requirements. The ANPR does not provide details on specific risk weights, risk factors, capital adequacy ratios and other important elements that could be applied to AIG under the consolidated approach, and we cannot predict how such an approach, if applied to AIG, would affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or capital requirements. We are currently reviewing the ANPR and expect it to be subject to significant industry comment. On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which a majority voted for the UK to withdraw its membership in the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The referendum is advisory, and the terms of withdrawal are subject to a formal negotiation period that has not yet begun and could, by treaty, last up to two years. It is not clear at this stage (and may not be for some time) what form the UK’s future relationship with the remaining EU member states will take. We have significant operations and employees in the UK and other EU member states, including AIG Europe Ltd. (AEL), which enjoys certain benefits based on the UK’s membership in the EU. Depending on the final terms of the UK exit, we may be required to reorganize our operations and legal entity structure in the UK and the EU in a manner that could be less efficient and more expensive.  In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 2. MD&A – Regulatory Environment and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 and in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Report.       192       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY         GLOSSARY      Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting.  Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected. Book Value Per Common Share, Excluding AOCI and Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI and DTA are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book Value Per Common Share, Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. Book Value Per Common Share, Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA, by Total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels. CVA  Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in AIGFP's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only, without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk in the fair value measurement of all derivative net liability positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments An adjustment to DAC for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (also referred to as “shadow DAC”). Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. First-Lien Priority over all other liens or claims on a property in the event of default on a mortgage.      193       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      General operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned.

IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. Loss Ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. Loss adjustment expenses are directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees, and claims department personnel costs. Loss reserve development The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. LTV Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each. Catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. Net premiums written Represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period, while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. Nonbank SIFI Nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institutions Financial institutions are deemed nonbank systemically important (that is, the failure of the financial institution could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council based on a three-stage analytical process. Noncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. Operating revenue excludes Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Policy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses.     194       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      Pool  A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage.

RBC Risk-Based Capital  A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. Reinstatement premium Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. Rescission Denial of claims and termination of coverage on loans related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms. Retroactive Reinsurance See Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI and DTA.

In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.      197     TABLE OF CONTENTS           PART II – OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1 / Legal Proceedings         For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1A./ Risk Factors         In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the following risk factor as well as the other risk factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2015 Annual Report. Our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. We provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United States may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country. On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which a majority voted for the UK to withdraw its membership in the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The referendum is advisory, and the terms of withdrawal are subject to a formal negotiation period that has not yet begun and could, by treaty, last up to two years. It is not clear at this stage (and may not be for some time) what form the UK’s future relationship with the remaining EU member states will take. We have significant operations and employees in the UK and other EU member states, including AEL, which enjoys certain benefits based on the UK’s membership in the EU. Depending on the final terms of the UK exit, we may be required to reorganize our operations and legal entity structure in the UK and the EU in a manner that could be less efficient and more expensive. Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate, increased the volatility of exchange rates among the Major Currencies, and created volatility in the financial markets, which may continue for some time.        198     TABLE OF CONTENTS           ITEM 2 / UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS          The following table provides the information with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of AIG or any “affiliated purchaser” (as defined in Rule 10b‑18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of AIG Common Stock and warrants to purchase AIG Common Stock during the three months ended June 30, 2016:        Total Number       Average   Total Number of Shares   Approximate Dollar Value of Shares             of Shares       Price Paid   Purchased as Part of Publicly    that May Yet Be Purchased Under the         Period   Repurchased       per Share   Announced Plans or Programs   Plans or Programs (in millions)         April 1 - 30   15,118,335   $   54.51   15,118,335       $   3,826         May 1 - 31   17,199,663       56.09   17,199,663           2,772         June 1 - 30(a)   17,737,231       54.89   17,737,231           1,798   (b)     Total(c)   50,055,229   $   55.19   50,055,229       $   1,798   (b)    (a) During this period, we also repurchased 5 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, at an average purchase price per warrant of $18.00, for an aggregate purchase price of $90 million.  (b) Reflects the purchase of 5 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, which reduced the dollar value of AIG Common Stock that may yet be repurchased under the repurchase authorization. (c) On August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $3.0 billion, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization on such date of approximately $4.0 billion. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately 50 million shares of AIG Common Stock under this authorization for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 plan, from July 1 to August 2, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $698 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock. We also repurchased 5 million warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock during the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of $90 million.
