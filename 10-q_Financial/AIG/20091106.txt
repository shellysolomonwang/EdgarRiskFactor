Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   In addition to reviewing AIG's results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of AIG for the year ended December 31, 2008, including the Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1) filed on April 30, 2009 (the 2008 Form 10-K), and the revised financial information reflecting the adoption of the accounting standard related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, included in AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 29, 2009 (collectively, the 2008 Financial Statements), to reflect developments in or affecting AIG's business to date during 2009.   Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Statutory underwriting profit (loss) is presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. AIG also uses cross-references to additional information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the 2008 Form 10-K to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject.   Overview   AIG identifies its operating segments by product line, consistent with its management structure. These segments are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions.   AIG's subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG's Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals.  Consideration of AIG's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   In the 2008 Form 10-K, management disclosed the conditions and events that led management to conclude that AIG would have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG's businesses, execute its asset disposition plan and repay its obligations for at least the next twelve months. At that time, the United States government issued the following statement referring to the March 2009 agreements in principle and other transactions they expected to  88      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  undertake with AIG (many of which were subsequently undertaken) to strengthen its capital position, enhance its liquidity, reduce its borrowing costs and facilitate AIG's asset disposition program.    "The steps announced today provide tangible evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to the orderly restructuring of AIG over time in the face of continuing market dislocations and economic deterioration. Orderly restructuring is essential to AIG's repayment of the support it has received from U.S. taxpayers and to preserving financial stability. The U.S. government is committed to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due."     In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management assessed whether AIG had the ability to continue as a going concern. In making this assessment, AIG considered:    •The commitment of the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury to the orderly restructuring of AIG and their commitment to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due;   •AIG's liquidity-related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the facility (the FRBNY Facility) provided by the FRBNY under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Agreement), between AIG and the FRBNY;   •The level of AIG's realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders' equity and on the capital levels of AIG's insurance subsidiaries;   •The substantial resolution of the liquidity issues surrounding the multi-sector super senior credit default swap portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) and the U.S. securities lending program;   •The additional capital provided or committed through the AIG Series F Preferred Stock to AIG by the Department of the Treasury;   •The proposed transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2009, among AIG, American International Reinsurance Company, Limited (AIRCO) and the FRBNY (the AIA Purchase Agreement) and the Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2009, between AIG and the FRBNY (the ALICO Purchase Agreement);   •The planned sales of significant subsidiaries;   •The continuing liquidity issues in certain of AIG's businesses and AIG's actions to address such issues; and   •The substantial risks to which AIG is subject.    See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2008 Form 10-K, Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion below for further details on these items.   In considering these items, management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of AIG's risks and uncertainties. Management also assessed other items and risks arising in AIG's businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto. After consideration, management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG's businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.   It is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management's plans could be materially different or that one or more of management's significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of the risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect or that the proposed transactions discussed below are not consummated. If one or more of these possible outcomes is realized, AIG may need additional U.S. government support to meet its obligations as they come due. If additional support is not available in such circumstances, there could be substantial doubt about AIG's ability to operate as a going concern.  89      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Capital Resources and Liquidity  Liquidity   At October 28, 2009, AIG had outstanding net borrowings under the FRBNY Facility of $41.7 billion, with a remaining borrowing capacity of $18.3 billion, and accrued compounding interest and fees of $5.2 billion. Net borrowings increased $5.9 billion from September 30, 2009 primarily due to AIG's secured loan of $2 billion to International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) that permitted ILFC to repay a maturing bank facility, and the repayment of approximately $4.9 billion in commercial paper maturities under the CPFF, which had the effect of unencumbering certain assets securing such commercial paper. The remaining amount outstanding under the CPFF after the October 2009 repayments is approximately $5.8 billion, which includes $2.0 billion for AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), $2.7 billion for Curzon Funding LLC, and $1.1 billion for Nightingale Finance LLC. In January 2010, AIG will assess whether to borrow additional funds under the FRBNY Facility in order to repay the remaining amounts outstanding under the CPFF, taking into account availability of other sources of funding.   The net borrowing amounts shown at September 30, 2009 and October 28, 2009 were reduced by approximately $1.6 billion drawn under the Department of the Treasury Commitment, but which had not yet been utilized, and are more fully described in the summary of drawdown activity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment shown below. In addition, the net borrowings as of these dates were further reduced by $1.6 billion due to loans to AIG from AGF. AIG expects that these loans will be repaid to support AGF's liquidity as needed.  Net borrowings outstanding and remaining available amount that can be borrowed under the FRBNY Facility were as follows:                                Inception Through          (in millions)   December 31, 2008   September 30, 2009   Increase (Decrease)            Net borrowings:                          Loans to AIGFP for collateral postings, GIA and other debt maturities    $ 46,997    $ 49,347    $ 2,350        AIGFP repayments to AIG      (4,093 )    (8,441 )    (4,348 )      Capital contributions and loans to insurance companies(a)      20,850      23,245      2,395        Repayment of obligations to securities lending program      3,160      3,160      -        Repayment of intercompany loans      1,528      1,528      -        Contributions to AIGCFG subsidiaries(b)      1,672      1,242      (430 )      Loans to ILFC      -      1,700      1,700        Debt payments      2,109      3,760      1,651        Funding of equity interest in ML III      5,000      5,000      -        Repayment from the proceeds of the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock and common stock warrant      (40,000 )    (40,000 )    -        Other(c)      (423 )    (4,741 )    (4,318 )          Net borrowings      36,800      35,800      (1,000 )          Total FRBNY Facility      60,000      60,000      -            Remaining available amount      23,200      24,200      1,000            Net borrowings      36,800      35,800      (1,000 )    Accrued compounding interest and fees(d)      3,631      5,209      1,578            Total balance outstanding    $ 40,431    $ 41,009    $ 578               (a)Includes securities lending activities.

(d) Excludes interest payable of $8 million and $5 million at December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively, which was included in Other liabilities.   90      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries     On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Department of the Treasury will provide an amount up to $29.835 billion (the Department of the Treasury Commitment) in exchange for increases in the liquidation preference of AIG's Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the AIG Series F Preferred Stock), so long as (i) AIG is not a debtor in a pending case under Title 11 of the United States Code; and (ii) the AIG Credit Facility Trust, a trust established for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury (Trust) (or any successor entity established for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury) and the Department of the Treasury, in the aggregate, "beneficially own" more than 50 percent of the aggregate voting power of AIG's voting securities. Upon drawings under this commitment, the liquidation preference of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock increases proportionately.  A summary of drawdown activity and available amount under the Department of the Treasury Commitment were as follows:                      (in millions)   Inception Through September 30, 2009              Drawdown No.1 on May 13, 2009(a)   $ 1,150        Drawdown No.2 on August 13, 2009(b)     2,056            Total drawdowns     3,206            Original availability under commitment     29,835      Less: Total drawdowns     (3,206 )          Remaining available amount at September 30, 2009   $ 26,629               (a)Represents a capital contribution to Domestic Life & Retirement Services companies.  (b) Represents UGC related restructuring transactions and a pending intercompany purchase of ILFC common shares. As of October 28, 2009, approximately $1.6 billion of the $2.056 billion received by AIG was temporarily utilized to repay the FRBNY Facility.    On November 6, 2009, AIG delivered a notice of an additional drawdown of approximately $2.1 billion under the Department of the Treasury Commitment related primarily to the intercompany purchase of ILFC common shares. AIG expects to receive the funds on November 13, 2009.   Additional details regarding liquidity sources are included in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries below.   Transactions Proposed to be Completed with the FRBNY   AIA Purchase Agreement   On June 25, 2009, AIG and AIRCO entered into the AIA Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY pursuant to which the FRBNY will purchase preferred equity interests in a newly formed special purpose vehicle in exchange for a reduction in the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred equity, which will be $16 billion, provided the maximum amount available under the FRBNY Facility will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction.   ALICO Purchase Agreement   On June 25, 2009, AIG entered into the ALICO Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY pursuant to which the FRBNY will purchase preferred equity interests in a newly formed special purpose vehicle in exchange for a reduction in the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred equity, which will be $9 billion, provided the maximum amount available under the FRBNY Facility will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction.   Amortization of Prepaid Commitment Asset   Any permanent reduction in the FRBNY Facility will result in accelerated amortization of a portion of the prepaid commitment asset. Therefore, AIG anticipates that the consummation of each of the AIA Purchase Agreement and  91      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  the ALICO Purchase Agreement will result in accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset at the time that the senior interests are transferred to the FRBNY, currently expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2009. Acceleration of the amortization will result in a pre-tax charge to earnings which AIG expects to aggregate to approximately $5 billion.   Life Insurance Securitizations   On March 2, 2009, AIG and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced their intent to enter into transactions pursuant to which the FRBNY will purchase embedded value securitization notes issued by newly-formed SPVs to be repaid with the net cash flows from designated blocks of existing life insurance policies. The proceeds of the notes would be applied in settlement of a portion of the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and would reduce the maximum amount to be borrowed under the FRBNY Facility (provided the maximum amount available thereunder will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction). The amount of the FRBNY Facility reduction will be based on the proceeds received and will also result in accelerated amortization of a portion of the prepaid commitment asset. The SPVs are expected to be consolidated by AIG.   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on additional transactions completed in 2009.  AIG's Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due  Future Cash Requirements   AIG expects that the repayment of future debt maturities will represent its primary use of financing cash flows.  The following table shows the maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                 (in millions)   Fourth Quarter 2009   First Quarter 2010   Second Quarter 2010   Third Quarter 2010   Total            AIG   $ 1,000   $ 888   $ -   $ 500   $ 2,388      AIG MIP     -     500     -     933     1,433      AIGFP     1,580     915     385     275     3,155      ILFC     3,049     738     1,476     2,070     7,333      AGF(a)(b)     1,661     723     589     5,192     8,165      Other subsidiaries     353     56     224     78     711            Total   $ 7,643   $ 3,820   $ 2,674   $ 9,048   $ 23,185               (a)American General Finance, Inc.  (b) On July 9, 2009, AGF converted the $2.45 billion of loans that AGF had previously drawn on its 364-Day Syndicated Facility into one-year term loans. AIG has provided a capital support agreement for the benefit of the lenders of these termed-out loans, which must be repaid by July 9, 2010.   Debt maturities for the Matched Investment Program (MIP) are expected to be funded through cash flows generated from invested assets (principal and interest) as well as the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program. Approximately $2.3 billion of AIGFP's debt maturities through September 30, 2010 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities.   In addition to these cash requirements, at October 28, 2009, AIG affiliates had $5.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding under the CPFF, all of which matures in January 2010, including $2.0 billion issued by AIG Funding. AIG Funding intends to repay this maturing commercial paper in January 2010, which could lead to an increase in borrowings under the FRBNY Facility.   AIG expects to meet these obligations primarily through the cash flows from, and the disposition of, assets supporting these obligations as well as through borrowings from the FRBNY Facility. In addition, AIG also expects to  92      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  collect dividends, distributions and other payments from certain subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. Additional liquidity is also available under the Department of Treasury Commitment.   In the first nine months of 2009, AIG made capital contributions of $2.4 billion to certain of its Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies. Approximately $1.2 billion of this amount was funded through drawdowns under the Department of the Treasury Commitment. If a substantial portion of the Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services bond portfolio diminishes significantly in value or suffers adverse credit events, AIG may need to provide additional capital support for these operations.   AIG made capital contributions of $641 million to its Commercial Insurance companies in the first six months of 2009, all of which was returned as a dividend to AIG in July 2009. In addition, in connection with the sale by a Commercial Insurance subsidiary of a portion of its common stock of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), AIG made a capital contribution of $91 million in the second quarter of 2009 to that company.   AIG also made a $600 million capital contribution to AGF (through AIG Capital Corporation) during the first nine months of 2009, and AGF loaned $1.6 billion to AIG parent under demand notes.   AIG has developed certain plans (described below), some of which have already been implemented, to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the FRBNY Facility; other plans are still being formulated.   Asset Disposition Plan   Since September 2008, AIG has been working to execute an orderly asset disposition plan, protect and enhance the value of its key businesses, and position these franchises for the future. AIG continually reassesses this plan to maximize value while maintaining flexibility in its liquidity and capital, and expects to accomplish this over a longer time frame than originally contemplated.   Sales of Businesses and Specific Asset Dispositions   Sales of Businesses   Dispositions of certain businesses will be subject to regulatory approval. Proceeds from these dispositions, to the extent they do not represent capital of AIG's insurance subsidiaries required for regulatory or ratings purposes, are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the FRBNY Facility as mandatory prepayments.   During the first nine months of 2009 and through October 30, 2009, AIG entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets, excluding AIGFP assets, that had aggregate assets and liabilities with carrying values of $86.3 billion and $69.2 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2009 or the date of sale or in the case of Transatlantic, deconsolidation. These transactions are expected to generate approximately $5.6 billion of aggregate net cash proceeds that will be available to repay outstanding borrowings and reduce the amount of the FRBNY Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses, settlement of intercompany loan facilities, and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes. Gains and losses recorded in connection with the dispositions of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment. Based on the transactions thus far, AIG does not believe that such adjustments will be material to future results of operations or cash flows.   These transactions included the following:    •On May 28, 2009, AIG completed the sale of its headquarters building in Tokyo for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. Due to AIG's continued involvement as a lessee, primarily in the form of a lease deposit, through 2011, the sale is accounted for as a financing arrangement with any gain deferred until the expiration of AIG's lease in early 2011.   •On June 10, 2009, AIG closed a public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock owned by AIG for aggregate proceeds of $1.1 billion. At the close of the public offering, AIG retained 13.9 percent of Transatlantic's outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, AIG deconsolidated Transatlantic, which resulted in a $1.4 billion reduction in Noncontrolling interest, a component of Total equity.   93      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   •On July 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of its U.S. auto insurance business, 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century). This operation had total assets and liabilities with carrying values of $5.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2009. Aggregate proceeds from the sale of this business, including proceeds applied to repay intercompany loan facilities, were $1.9 billion.   •On July 28, 2009, AIG completed the sale of a majority of the U.S. life insurance premium finance business of AIG Credit Corp. and A.I. Credit Consumer Discount Company (A.I. Credit), with a carrying value of $941.3 million at that date, for $680 million in cash, including $230 million held in escrow, and an additional $61.2 million if future certain conditions are met.   •On September 5, 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its investment advisory and third party institutional asset management business for total consideration consisting of a cash payment determined at closing based on the net assets of the business being sold plus additional future contingent consideration and a continued share of carried interest.    Sale of Nan Shan   On October 12, 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent share of Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) for approximately $2.15 billion to a consortium. As a result of this transaction, AIG expects to meet the criteria in the fourth quarter of 2009 for "held-for-sale" accounting with respect to Nan Shan and recognize a loss presently estimated to be $1.4 billion net of taxes in that quarter. AIG analyzed its assets and liabilities, including its deferred acquisition costs and the adequacy of its insurance liabilities as of September 30, 2009, before Nan Shan met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and concluded that no impairment of assets or recognition of additional liabilities was necessary.   AGF Portfolio Sales and Securitization Transaction   During the first nine months of 2009, AGF received proceeds of $1.7 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales. In addition, on July 30, 2009, AGF issued mortgage-backed certificates in a private securitization transaction of certain AGF real estate loans and received initial cash proceeds of $967 million.   AIGFP Wind-down   AIGFP is engaged in a multi-step process of unwinding its businesses and portfolios. In connection with that process, certain assets have been sold, or are under contract to be sold. The proceeds from these sales will be used to fund AIGFP's wind-down and are not included in the amounts described above under Sales of Businesses. The FRBNY has waived the requirement under the FRBNY Credit Agreement that the proceeds of these specific pending sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the FRBNY Facility, which would result in a permanent reduction of the FRBNY's commitment to lend to AIG. Instead, the FRBNY has given AIGFP permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales, and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the FRBNY Facility, with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the FRBNY Facility. AIGFP is also opportunistically terminating contracts. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with AIG's affiliated businesses. Due to the long-term duration of AIGFP's derivative contracts and the complexity of AIGFP's portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down of AIGFP will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.   On August 11, 2009, AIGFP completed the sale of its energy and infrastructure investment assets, realizing aggregate net proceeds of $619 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009.   AIG continually evaluates overall market conditions, performance of businesses that are for sale, and market and business performance of competitors and likely bidders for these assets. This evaluation informs decision-making about the timing and process of putting businesses up for sale. Depending on market and business conditions, as  94      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  noted above, AIG can modify its sales approach to maximize value for AIG and the U.S. taxpayers in the disposition process. Such a modification could result in the sale of additional or other assets.   Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries   Since August 2009, AIG's liquidity position has remained relatively stable. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to liquidity.   AIG (Parent)   AIG Parent had the following sources of liquidity:                             As of      (In millions)   September 30, 2009   October 28, 2009            Available borrowing under the FRBNY Facility   $ 24,200   $ 18,300      Available commercial paper borrowings under the CPFF     3,492     4,872      Cash and short-term investments     936     359      Available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment     26,629     26,629            Total   $ 55,257   $ 50,160              AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls at AIGFP, a further downgrade of AIG's credit ratings or unexpected capital or liquidity needs of AIG's subsidiaries may result in significant additional cash needs or loss of some sources of liquidity or both.   Since the fourth quarter of 2008, AIG has not had access to its traditional sources of long-term or short-term financing through the public debt markets. While no assurance can be given that AIG will be able to access these markets again, AIG continually evaluates its ability to access the capital markets.   Historically AIG depended on dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. In light of AIG's current financial situation, certain of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG. As a result, AIG has been dependent on the FRBNY Facility, the CPFF and other transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury as its primary sources of liquidity. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, AIG parent collected $1.2 billion in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries (primarily from insurance company subsidiaries), and retired $381 million of debt, excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. Excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt, AIG parent made interest payments totaling $1.4 billion, and made $2.6 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, AIG parent made loans totaling $1.2 billion to wholly owned subsidiaries, which in turn principally were used to make capital contributions to insurance companies.   AIG parent traditionally funded a portion of its short-term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. Since October 2008, all commercial paper issuance for AIG Funding has been through the CPFF program. AIG Funding was accepted into the CPFF with a total borrowing limit of $6.9 billion, and had approximately $3.4 billion and $2.0 billion outstanding at September 30, 2009 and October 28, 2009, respectively. All commercial paper outstanding for AIG Funding as of these dates was issued under the CPFF. As of September 30, 2009 and October 28, 2009, AIG Funding's commercial paper program had average maturities of 23 days and 86 days, respectively. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has extended the CPFF program until February 1, 2010, with the maximum final maturity of 90 days from that date. If AIG's short-term ratings are downgraded, AIG may lose access to the CPFF before the final maturity. If AIG loses access to the CPFF, it would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper.   AIG expects to use proceeds from the repayment of intercompany debt received in connection with the sales of assets to fund maturing commercial paper.  95                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   The consolidated U.S. members deferred tax asset for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and valuation allowance are maintained at AIG Parent and are not allocated to its subsidiaries. As the consolidated net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards are utilized, the intercompany tax balance will be settled with the subsidiaries.   AIG's liquidity could also be further impaired by unforeseen significant outflows of cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may be unable to control, such as a further reduction in asset values, a ratings downgrade, a worsening of the current economic downturn or the requirements of subsidiaries to replace capital as a consequence of catastrophe claims. Regulatory and other legal restrictions would likely limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   General Insurance   AIG currently expects that its General Insurance subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. One or more large catastrophes, however, may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected General Insurance operations. In addition, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries. A downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect these companies' ability to meet their own obligations and require that AIG provide capital or liquidity support to them.   At September 30, 2009, General Insurance had liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments of $10.5 billion. These are consolidated cash and short-term investments for a number of legal entities within General Insurance. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, there are generally sufficient cash and short-term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs. In the event additional liquidity is required, management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities. Government and corporate bonds represented 95.3 percent of General Insurance total fixed income investments at September 30, 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's General Insurance investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. AIG's asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of AIG's General Insurance investments and the payment of claims.   Life Insurance & Retirement Services   At September 30, 2009, Life Insurance & Retirement Services had liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments of $35.4 billion, which management considers more than adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. This unusually high level of liquidity, although considered by management to be prudent given recent market disruptions and AIG-specific issues, has resulted in reduced investment income in 2009. These are consolidated cash and short-term investments for a number of legal entities within Life Insurance & Retirement Services. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, there are generally sufficient cash and short-term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs. In the event additional liquidity is required, management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities. Government and corporate bonds represented 86.7 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services total fixed income investments at September 30, 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG's Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. The Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries have been able to meet liquidity needs, even during the period of higher surrenders which was experienced from mid-September 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, and expect to be able to do so in the foreseeable future. A significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, which could be triggered by a variety of factors, including AIG specific concerns, could result in a substantial liquidity strain. Other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other economic or political upheaval.  96      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Foreign Life Insurance Companies   AIG's Foreign Life Insurance companies (including ALICO) had significant capital needs following publicity of AIG parent's liquidity issues, related credit ratings downgrades and the decline in the equity markets in 2008. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, AIG provided funding of $300 million to a subsidiary within the Foreign Life Insurance companies.   AIG believes that its Foreign Life Insurance subsidiaries currently have adequate capital to support their business plans. However, to the extent there are future declines in the investment portfolios of the Foreign Life Insurance companies AIG may need to lend or contribute additional capital to these companies.   Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services Companies   During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, AIG contributed capital totaling $2.4 billion to certain of its Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services subsidiaries (of which $165 million was retained in the Domestic Life Insurance holding company and not contributed to the operating companies) to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses (primarily resulting from other-than-temporary impairment charges) and other investment-related items. Of this amount, $1.2 billion was funded by drawdowns under the Department of the Treasury Commitment in May 2009. Further capital contributions may be required to maintain desired levels of capital to the extent there are future declines in the investment portfolios of the Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies.   The most significant potential liquidity needs of AIG's Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies are the funding of surrenders and withdrawals. A substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies. However, management believes that these companies have sufficient short-term liquidity to meet such demands.   Financial Services   AIG's major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of ILFC, AIGFP, AGF and AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). Traditional sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available. These sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), issuance of long- and short-term debt, issuance of commercial paper, bank loans and bank credit facilities. However, ILFC has been able to finance Airbus aircraft purchases under its 2004 Export Credit Agency (ECA) Facility, as further described below, and AIGCFG has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits, providing a measure of liquidity.   ILFC   Prior to September 2008, ILFC's traditional sources of liquidity had been collections of aircraft lease payments, borrowings in the public debt markets, borrowings under its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities to fund aircraft purchases, proceeds of aircraft sales and income from third parties for fleet management services.   During the first nine months of 2009, ILFC was unable to borrow in the public debt markets and, due to downgrades in its short-term credit rating, lost access to the CPFF and therefore borrowed $1.7 billion from AIG Funding to repay its maturing debt and other contractual obligations. In addition, ILFC borrowed approximately $161 million through secured financing arrangements. ILFC is currently pursuing additional secured financings from banks. ILFC had the capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing of approximately $5.0 billion (or more through subsidiaries that qualify as non-restricted subsidiaries under ILFC's indentures, subject to the receipt of any required consents under the FRBNY Facility and under its bank facilities and terms loans). If ILFC does not receive sufficient secured financing, AIG expects that ILFC's current borrowings and future cash flows from operations, which may include aircraft sales, may be inadequate to permit ILFC to meet its existing obligations. Should sales of aircraft be required, ILFC could incur losses on those sales and may incur impairment charges on its aircraft, depending on, among other things, the specific aircraft sold and market conditions at the time of sale. AIG intends to provide support to ILFC through November 15, 2010 to the extent that secured financing, aircraft sales and other sources of funds are not sufficient.  97      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Under its current long-term debt ratings, ILFC needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 ECA Facility before it can fund Airbus aircraft deliveries under the facility. As of October 30, 2009, ILFC had approximately $600 million available under the 2004 ECA Facility to finance its Airbus aircraft purchases through June 2010. ILFC financed 25 aircraft under the 2004 ECA Facility during the first nine months of 2009, 19 of which required written consent, which was obtained. ILFC's current credit ratings also require segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves for aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts. As a result of Moody's downgrade of ILFC's long-term debt ratings to Baa3 on July 31, 2009, in addition to segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves, under the 2004 ECA Facility, ILFC is required to (i) segregate subsequent rental payments received into the separate accounts; (ii) cede control of the segregated accounts to the security trustee of the 2004 ECA Facility; and (iii) file individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which its lessees operate. At September 30, 2009, ILFC had segregated security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments aggregating $290 million related to such aircraft, of which $229 million related to the 2004 ECA Facility. The segregated amounts will fluctuate with changes in deposits, maintenance reserves and debt maturities related to the aircraft funded under the facilities. Further downgrades by S&P and Moody's could impose additional restrictions under the 1999 ECA Facility, including the requirement to segregate rental payments and to receive prior consent to withdraw funds from the segregated accounts.   On October 13, 2009, ILFC entered into two term loan agreements (the Term Loans) with AIG Funding comprising a new $2.0 billion credit agreement and a $1.7 billion amended and restated credit agreement. The Term Loans are secured by a portfolio of aircraft and all related equipment and leases. ILFC used the proceeds from the $2.0 billion loan to repay in full its obligations under its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility that matured on October 15, 2009. The second credit agreement amended and restated the two demand note agreements aggregating $1.7 billion that ILFC entered into in March 2009 with AIG Funding, including extending the maturity date of such demand notes. Both Term Loans mature on September 13, 2013 and bear interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 3.025%. The Term Loans are due in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization. The funds for the Term Loans were provided to AIG Funding through the FRBNY Facility. As a condition of the FRBNY approving the Term Loans, ILFC entered into agreements to guarantee the repayment of AIG's obligations under the FRBNY Credit Agreement up to an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding balance of the Term Loans.   As a result of the Term Loans, ILFC's current capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing is approximately $1.3 billion.   AIGFP   Prior to September 2008, AIGFP had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds, GIA borrowings, other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements.   In the second half of 2008, AIGFP's access to its traditional sources of liquidity was significantly reduced and it relied on AIG parent to meet most of its liquidity needs. AIGFP's asset backed commercial paper conduit, Curzon Funding LLC, was accepted into the CPFF with a total borrowing limit of $7.2 billion, and had approximately $2.7 billion outstanding at October 28, 2009. Separately, a structured investment vehicle sponsored, but not consolidated, by AIGFP, Nightingale Finance LLC, was also accepted into the CPFF with a borrowing limit of $1.1 billion. As of October 28, 2009, this vehicle had issued approximately $1.1 billion under the CPFF. If AIG's short-term ratings are downgraded, these entities may lose access to the CPFF prior to the maturity of the commercial paper and they or AIGFP would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper.   The following table presents a roll forward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP:                              Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009 (in millions)   Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2008   Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty   Collateral Returned by Counterparties   Collateral Posted as of September 30, 2009            Collateralized GIAs and other borrowings   $ 9,401   $ 336   $ 2,748   $ 6,989      Derivatives (including super senior credit default swaps)     22,791     1,584     13,059     11,316            Total   $ 32,192   $ 1,920   $ 15,807   $ 18,305             98      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  AGF   Prior to September 2008, AGF's traditional source of liquidity had been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets.   With its continued inability to access traditional capital market sources, AGF anticipates that its primary source of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections. In order to improve cash flow from operations, AGF has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses. Since September 2008 and through October 30, 2009, AGF's alternative funding sources have included proceeds of $1.7 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales and initial cash proceeds of $967 million from a real estate loan securitization. AGF is considering additional sales and/or securitizations of its finance receivables. AIG intends to provide support to AGF through November 15, 2010 to the extent that asset sales, securitizations and/or other transactions are not sufficient. AIG made a $600 million capital contribution to AGF (through AIG Capital Corporation) during the first nine months of 2009, and AGF loaned $1.6 billion to AIG parent under demand notes. In July 2009, AGF converted the $2.45 billion of loans that AGF had previously drawn on its 364-day Syndicated Facility into one-year term loans. These termed-out loans must be repaid by July 9, 2010. AIG provides a capital support agreement to AGF in connection with these loans.   AIGCFG   AIG believes that the funding needs of AIGCFG have stabilized. It is possible that renewed customer and counterparty concerns could increase AIGCFG's liquidity needs in 2009. During the first nine months of 2009 and through October 30, 2009, AIG has completed the sale of certain AIGCFG businesses in China, Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico and Hong Kong.   Asset Management   Asset Management's principal cash requirements are to fund general working capital needs, investment commitments related to proprietary investments in private equity and real estate as well as any liquidity mismatches in the Spread-Based Investment business. Management continues to work closely with partners and counterparties to manage future funding requirements on proprietary investments through various strategies including through relinquishing rights in certain properties and funds, the restructuring of investment relationships and sales to third parties.   Cash requirements related to Institutional Asset Management are funded through general operating cash flows from management and performance fees, proceeds from events in underlying funds (capital calls to third parties, sales of portfolio companies, etc.) as well as intercompany funding provided by AIG. Consequently, Institutional Asset Management's ability to fund certain of its needs may depend on advances from AIG under various intercompany borrowing facilities. Restrictions on these facilities would have adverse consequences on the ability of the business to satisfy its obligations. With respect to the Global Real Estate investment management business, investing activities are also funded through third-party financing arrangements which are secured by the relevant properties.   With the announced sale of AIG's investment advisory and third party Institutional Asset Management business (excluding the Global Real Estate investment management business), AIG will no longer benefit from the management fee and carried interest cash flows from these businesses, but the sale will reduce operating costs related to AIG's asset management activities.   The Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) and MIP programs are in run-off. AIG expects to fund its obligations under these programs through cash flows generated from invested assets (principal and interest) as well as sales of investments, primarily fixed maturity securities. However, market illiquidity and diminished values within the investment portfolios may impair AIG's ability to sell the related program assets or sell such assets for a price adequate to settle the corresponding liabilities when they come due. In such a case, AIG parent would need to fund the obligations.  99                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Debt   Total debt was as follows:                          (in millions)   September 30, 2009   December 31, 2008              Debt issued by AIG:                    FRBNY Facility (secured)    $ 41,009    $ 40,431          Notes and bonds payable      11,457      11,756        Junior subordinated debt      12,026      11,685          Junior subordinated debt attributable to equity units      5,880      5,880        Loans and mortgages payable      391      416          MIP matched notes and bonds payable      13,596      14,446        Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable      4,019      4,660                Total AIG debt      88,378      89,274            Debt guaranteed by AIG:                    AIGFP, at fair value                    Commercial paper and other short-term debt(a)      6,233      6,802          GIAs      9,204      13,860        Notes and bonds payable      3,247      5,250          Loans and mortgages payable      997      2,175        Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      1,815      2,113                Total AIGFP debt      21,496      30,200            AIG Funding commercial paper(a)      3,374      6,856              AIGLH notes and bonds payable      798      798              Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock      1,339      1,415            Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG      115,385      128,543              Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                  ILFC                      Commercial paper and other short-term debt(a)      -      1,748        Junior subordinated debt      999      999          Notes and bonds payable, ECA Facilities, bank financings and other secured financings(b)      28,271      30,047              Total ILFC debt      29,270      32,794              AGF                    Commercial paper and other short-term debt      -      188          Junior subordinated debt      349      349        Notes and bonds payable      21,599      23,089                Total AGF debt      21,948      23,626            AIGCFG                      Commercial paper and other short-term debt      -      124        Loans and mortgages payable      908      1,596                Total AIGCFG debt      908      1,720            Other subsidiaries      285      670              Debt of consolidated investments held through:                    AIG Investments      519      1,300          AIG Global Real Estate Investment      4,389      4,545        ALICO      98      -          SunAmerica      11      5              Total debt of consolidated investments      5,017      5,850              Total debt not guaranteed by AIG      57,428      64,660            Total debt:                      Total commercial paper and other short-term debt      -      613        Federal Reserve Bank of New York commercial paper funding facility      9,607      15,105          Total long-term debt      163,206      177,485              Total debt    $ 172,813    $ 193,203             100      Table of Contents    (a)Includes borrowings of $6.2 billion and $3.4 billion for AIGFP (through Curzon Funding LLC, AIGFP's asset-backed commercial paper conduit) and AIG Funding, respectively, under the CPFF at September 30, 2009 and $6.8 billion, $6.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, for AIGFP (through Curzon Funding LLC), AIG Funding and ILFC, respectively, under the CPFF at December 31, 2008.

(b)Reflects future minimum payment for ILFC's borrowings under the 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities. (c)On July 9, 2009, AGF converted the $2.45 billion of loans that AGF had previously drawn on its 364-Day Syndicated Facility into one-year term loans. AIG has provided a capital support agreement for the benefit of the lenders of these termed-out loans, which must be repaid by July 9, 2010.   AIG (Parent Company)   AIG historically issued debt securities from time to time to meet its financing needs and those of certain of its subsidiaries, as well as to opportunistically fund the MIP. The maturities of the debt securities issued by AIG to fund the MIP are generally expected to be paid using the cash flows of assets held by AIG as part of the MIP portfolio. However, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows of the MIP, as well as shortfalls due to impairments of MIP assets, would need to be funded by AIG parent.   As of September 30, 2009, approximately $7.1 billion principal amount of senior notes were outstanding under AIG's medium-term note program, of which $3.2 billion was used for AIG's general corporate purposes, $558 million was used by AIGFP (included within "Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable" in the preceding tables) and $3.3 billion was used to fund the MIP. The maturity dates of these notes range from 2010 to 2052. To the extent considered appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.  102      Table of Contents  As of September 30, 2009, the equivalent of $11.8 billion of notes were outstanding under AIG's Euro medium-term note program, of which $9.8 billion were used to fund the MIP and the remainder was used for AIG's general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount outstanding includes a $1.1 billion loss resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars related to notes issued to fund the MIP. AIG has economically hedged the currency exposure arising from its foreign currency denominated notes.   AIGLH   In connection with its acquisition of AIGLH in 2001, AIG entered into arrangements with AIGLH with respect to outstanding AIGLH capital securities. In 1996, AIGLH through a trust issued capital securities to institutional investors and funded the trust with AIGLH junior subordinated debentures issued to the trust. AIGLH guaranteed payments to the holders of capital securities only to the extent (i) the trust received payments on the debentures and (ii) these payments were available for the trust to pay to holders of capital securities. In 2001, AIG guaranteed the same payments to the holders of capital securities. Like the AIGLH guarantee, the AIG guarantee only applies to any payments actually made to the trust in respect of the debentures. If no payments are made on the debentures, AIG is not required to make any payments to the trust. AIG also guaranteed the debentures pursuant to a guarantee that is expressly subordinated to certain AIGLH senior debt securities. Under AIG's guarantee, AIG is not required to make any payments in respect of the debentures if such payment would be prohibited by the subordination provisions of the debentures. As a result, AIG will never be required to make a payment under its guarantee of the debentures for so long as AIGLH is prohibited from making a payment on the debentures.   AIGFP   Approximately $2.3 billion of AIGFP's debt maturing through September 30, 2010 is fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities. However, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and AIGFP's ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG parent.   ILFC   ILFC has a $4.3 billion 1999 ECA Facility that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.78 percent to 5.86 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At September 30, 2009, ILFC had 35 loans with a remaining principal balance of $200 million outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility.   ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 ECA Facility, which was amended in May 2009 to allow ILFC to borrow up to a maximum of $4.6 billion to fund the purchase of Airbus aircraft delivered through June 30, 2010. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a forward-looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 2.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 4.20 percent to 4.71 percent. At September 30, 2009, ILFC had financed 66 aircraft using approximately $4.0 billion under this facility and approximately $2.9 billion was outstanding. At September 30, 2009, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 0.74 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC's notes and bonds payable in the preceding table of borrowings.   At September 30, 2009, the total funded amount of ILFC's bank financings was $7.1 billion, which includes $6.5 billion of revolving credit facilities (see Revolving Credit Facilities below). The fundings mature through February 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.40 percent. At September 30, 2009, the interest rates ranged from 0.59 percent to 1.23 percent. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC. On October 15, 2009, ILFC repaid a $2.0 billion tranche of the revolving credit facilities when it matured, using proceeds from the Term Loans described above.  103                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   In April 2009, ILFC entered into a $100 million 90-day promissory note agreement with a supplier in connection with the purchase of an aircraft. The interest rate was fixed at an annual rate of 5.00 percent. The note was paid in full in July 2009, when it matured.   AGF   As of September 30, 2009, notes and bonds aggregating $21.6 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from 0.40 percent to 9.00 percent. To the extent considered appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds.   AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF but has provided a capital support agreement for the benefit of AGF's lenders under the AGF 364-Day Syndicated Facility. Under this support agreement, AIG has agreed to cause AIG's wholly-owned subsidiary, American General Finance Corporation to maintain (1) consolidated net worth of $2.2 billion and (2) an adjusted tangible leverage ratio of less than or equal to 8 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter. This support agreement benefits only the lenders under the AGF 364-Day Syndicated Facility and does not benefit, and is not enforceable by, any of the other creditors of AGF. This support agreement continued for the benefit of AGF's lenders upon the conversion of the facility borrowings into one-year term loans in July 2009.   Revolving Credit Facilities   ILFC and AGF have maintained committed, unsecured revolving credit facilities listed on the table below. Both ILFC and AGF have drawn the full amount available under their revolving credit facilities. In July 2009, AIG's 364-Day Syndicated Facility expired and, in August 2009, AIG terminated its 5-Year Syndicated Facility. As a result, AIG no longer has access to any revolving credit facilities.   A summary of revolving credit facilities is as follows:                          At September 30, 2009 (in millions) Facility   Size   Borrower(s)   Available Amount   Expiration        ILFC:                        5-Year Syndicated Facility   $ 2,500   ILFC   $ -   October 2011      5-Year Syndicated Facility     2,000   ILFC   -   October 2010      5-Year Syndicated Facility     2,000   ILFC   -   October 2009(a)            Total ILFC   $ 6,500       $ -                AGF:                        1-Year Term Loans   $ 2,450   American General Finance Corporation   -   July 2010(b)             American General Finance, Inc.(c)   -          5-Year Syndicated Facility     2,125   American General Finance Corporation   -   July 2010            Total AGF   $ 4,575       $ -                   (a)On October 15, 2009, ILFC repaid the outstanding amount on this facility.

(c)American General Finance, Inc. was an eligible borrower for up to $400 million only.  104      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of October 30, 2009. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of AIGFP's GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require AIGFP, upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings, to post collateral or, with the consent of the counterparties, assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effect of a downgrade in AIG's credit ratings on AIGFP's outstanding municipal GIAs, secured funding arrangements and financial derivative transactions, see Item 1A.

(b)Represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. (c)Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of AIG's control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on inforce policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the balance sheet. (d)Represents guaranteed maturities under GICs. (e)Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (f)Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $3.8 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. (g)The majority of AIGFP's credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At September 30, 2009, the fair value derivative liability was $4.5 billion relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, net of amounts realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, AIGFP has posted collateral of $3.8 billion with respect to these swaps (prior to offsets for other transactions).  106      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity were as follows:                                     At September 30, 2009           Amount of Commitment Expiration      (in millions)   Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2009   2010 - 2011   2012 - 2013   2014   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 928   $ -   $ -   $ 827   $ -   $ 101        Standby letters of credit     1,284     1,100     34     19     -     131        Construction guarantees(b)     238     2     145     -     -     91        Guarantees of indebtedness     211     -     -     -     -     211        All other guarantees     2,173     11     46     188     49     1,879      Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(c)     7,589     1,627     2,738     1,638     542     1,044        Commitments to extend credit     237     68     117     35     15     2        Letters of credit     264     174     89     1     -     -        Other commercial commitments(d)     692     44     -     -     -     648            Total(e)   $ 13,616   $ 3,026   $ 3,169   $ 2,708   $ 606   $ 4,107               (a)Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.

The remaining pension contribution for 2009 is expected to be approximately $33 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (e)Does not include guarantees or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.   Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities   AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business. AIG's insurance companies are involved with VIEs primarily as passive investors in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. Through its Financial Services and Asset Management operations, AIG has participated in arrangements that included designing and structuring entities (including VIEs), warehousing and managing the collateral of the entities (including VIEs), and entering into insurance transactions with VIEs. Interest holders in the VIEs generally have recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to AIG, except, in limited circumstances, when AIG has provided a guarantee to the VIEs' interest holders.   AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the party that either (i) absorbs a majority of the VIE's expected losses; (ii) receives a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns; or (iii) both. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Outlook   Global financial markets continued their recovery in the third quarter of 2009, as investors returned to equity and bond markets. This optimism, not yet accompanied by a robust economic recovery, produced a strong rally in bond, equity and commodity markets. Cash accumulated by investors in 2008 and early 2009 continued to flow out of short-term money market accounts and into higher yielding assets, creating investment demand in excess of available new supply in many sectors. While securitized mortgage products participated to a degree in the rally, particularly in desirable tranches of well-collateralized transactions, the commercial mortgage and equity real estate sectors continue to lag.  107      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  As AIG implements the proposed transactions with the FRBNY described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and executes its plans for repaying the FRBNY Facility, AIG expects to incur significant additional restructuring-related charges, such as accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset and, potentially, the write-off of intangible assets. Further, if AIG continues to incur losses in its businesses, AIG may need to write off material amounts of goodwill and deferred tax assets.   On June 10, 2009, the Treasury Department issued regulations implementing the compensation limits of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These regulations restrict the amount of bonus and other incentive compensation that a company may pay to certain employees. For AIG these limits apply to the five executives named in AIG's proxy statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of AIG (the Top 25). The regulations also create the Office of Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation (Special Master), which is responsible for interpreting and applying the compensation regulations. AIG is required to obtain the Special Master's approval of the compensation of the Top 25, and the compensation structure of AIG's executive officers and AIG's next 26 to 100 most highly compensated employees. On October 22, 2009, the Special Master issued a Determination Memorandum to AIG with respect to the Top 25. The Determination Memorandum places significant new restrictions on the compensation of these employees (except for the Chief Executive Officer) and the restrictions in the Determination Memorandum may impair AIG's ability to retain and motivate them. See Item 1A., Risk Factors, of Part II of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion of this risk.   Almost all of AIG's businesses have been adversely affected since March 2009 by the criticism and negative publicity that surrounded the honoring of and payment of contracts to employees of AIGFP. For a discussion of the effect that continued or renewed criticism or additional negative publicity may have on AIG, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of AIG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  General Insurance   AIG's General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad and constitute Commercial Insurance and the Foreign General Insurance Group. On July 27, 2009, it was announced that AIG's General Insurance subsidiaries would undergo a rebranding and would do business as Chartis, which will consist of Commercial Insurance (operating as Chartis U.S.), Foreign General Insurance (operating as Chartis International), and Private Client Group (part of Chartis U.S.).   AIG's Commercial Insurance operations have been generally successful in retaining clients, however, some clients reduced the number of lines or limits of coverage due in part to the overall state of the economy as well as concerns over AIG's financial strength. This trend of de-risking is expected to slow for the remainder of 2009 as business retention at September 30, 2009 was at its highest level since September 2008. Net premiums written improved in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the three prior quarters. Commercial Insurance showed increases in submission counts and $1.1 billion in new business written for the second consecutive quarter. Net premiums written have been affected by the strategic decision to remain price disciplined, particularly in the workers' compensation line of business, and the overall effect of the weakened state of the economy. Rates in the third quarter of 2009, remained stable reflecting the upward pressure on premiums from the combination of investment and underwriting losses suffered by the commercial insurance industry, partially offset by the effects of the current recessionary environment, such as employment levels for workers' compensation coverages and shipments of goods for commercial automobile coverages, as well as aggressive pricing, including from new competitors in the marketplace.   Foreign General Insurance maintained solid client retention rates in the third quarter of 2009 in key regions. The trend of de-risking by some customers and the effect of the economic conditions is expected to slow and therefore Foreign General's net premiums written are anticipated to stabilize. Although Foreign General faces challenges in commercial lines, particularly in the U.K. and Europe regions due to continued competition, its traditional capabilities of servicing its customers, innovation and claims paying ability continue to attract new accounts.  108      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries Life Insurance & Retirement Services   AIG expects that negative publicity about AIG during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009, AIG's previously announced asset disposition plan and the uncertainties related to AIG will continue to adversely affect Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations for the remainder of 2009, especially in the domestic businesses. In addition, AIG's issues have affected certain operations through higher surrender activity, primarily in the U.S. domestic retirement fixed annuity business and foreign investment-oriented and retirement products. Surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid-September of 2008 and have begun to stabilize and return to pre-September 2008 levels for most products and countries.   These uncertainties, together with rating agency downgrades, have resulted in significantly reduced levels of new sales activity, particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical. Sales of investment-oriented and retirement services products have also declined due to the lingering effect of negative AIG events earlier in the year and the overall decline in industry sales of investment-oriented life and retirement services products. New sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels for certain markets until the uncertainties relating to AIG are resolved. AIA and ALICO have recently experienced improved operating conditions and are expected to continue to improve as the rebranding initiatives and revitalization of their distribution networks continues.   On June 25, 2009, AIG and AIRCO entered into the AIA Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY and AIG entered into the ALICO Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY. The transactions contemplated by the AIA Purchase Agreement and the ALICO Purchase Agreement are conditioned on one another and subject to certain other conditions, including regulatory approvals. It is expected that the transactions will result in a reduction in the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred equity, which will be $25 billion, provided the maximum amount available under the FRBNY Facility will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction.   With the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard in the second quarter of 2009, AIG expects future investment yields to decline compared to the same periods in 2008 due to lower accretion. In prior periods, AIG accreted into earnings over the expected period to recovery the discount or reduced premium resulting from the reduction in the cost basis of other-than-temporarily impaired securities, which consisted primarily of securities impaired for severity reasons. Upon the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard, approximately $1.8 billion of previously recognized other-than-temporarily impaired charges, primarily severity related, were reclassified from Accumulated deficit to Accumulated other comprehensive income. As a consequence, commencing in the second quarter of 2009, there will be no accretion attributable to the amounts reclassified into Accumulated other comprehensive income. This will be partially offset by lower deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization in future periods resulting from the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard. Additionally, higher liquidity and de-risking activities continue to negatively affect net investment income margins.  Financial Services   AIGFP began unwinding its businesses and portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2008, and these activities are expected to continue beyond 2009. In connection with these activities, AIGFP has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate "books," and has developed a plan for addressing each book, including assessing each book's risks, risk mitigation options, monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes. Each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of AIG. The plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve, and they contemplate, depending on the book in question, alternative strategies, including sales, assignments or other transfers of positions, terminations of positions, and/or run-offs of positions in accordance with existing terms. Execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving increasingly senior members of AIGFP's and AIG's respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences. Successful execution of these plans is subject, to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book, to market conditions and, in many circumstances, counterparty negotiation and agreement.  109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses. AIGFP has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio, including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs in connection with the Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) transaction, a sale of its commodity index business, termination and sale of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker, and sale and other disposition of its energy/infrastructure investment portfolio. Due to the long-term duration of many of AIGFP's derivative contracts and to the complexity of AIGFP's portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIGFP's control, including market conditions, AIGFP's access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades. In addition, the Determination Memorandum issued by the Special Master places significant new restrictions on the compensation of AIGFP employees included in the Top 25 and may impair AIGFP's ability to retain these employees and negatively impact the wind-down of AIGFP's business.  Asset Management   Continued difficult market conditions have caused a decline in the value of certain private equity and real estate assets held for investment purposes resulting in impairment charges. The persistence of the troubled global economy driven by tight credit markets and rising unemployment will likely continue to adversely affect operating income in future periods. Management continues to assess value declines and the permanence of such declines. These market conditions have also adversely affected the ability to pay or refinance maturing debt obligations in the private equity and real estate portfolios.   On September 5, 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its investment advisory and third party Institutional Asset Management businesses. This sale will exclude those asset management businesses providing traditional fixed income and shorter duration asset and liability management for AIG's insurance company subsidiaries and AIG's Global Real Estate investment management business as well as proprietary real estate and private equity investments of the Institutional Asset Management business. AIG will also retain its real estate asset management business. AIG expects to continue short-term relationships with the divested businesses for other investment management services used by its insurance company subsidiaries.   Results of Operations   AIG identifies its operating segments by product line, consistent with its management structure. These segments are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG's Other category consists of business and items not allocated to AIG's operating segments.   AIG's subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG's Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals.  110                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Consolidated Results   AIG's consolidated results of operations were as follows:                                           Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase (Decrease)   Percentage Increase (Decrease)     (in millions)   2009   2008   2009   2008            Revenues:                                            Premiums and other considerations    $ 16,041    $ 21,082      (24 )%  $ 52,630    $ 63,489      (17 )%      Net investment income      8,656      2,946      194      19,724      14,628      35        Net realized capital losses      (2,937 )    (18,312 )    -      (7,338 )    (30,482 )    -        Unrealized market valuation gains (losses) on AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio      959      (7,054 )    -      1,143      (21,726 )    -        Other income      3,330      2,236      49      9,873      8,953      10              Total revenues      26,049      898      -      76,032      34,862      118            Benefits, claims and expenses:                                            Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      15,882      17,189      (8 )    49,198      51,521      (5 )      Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses      4,812      6,782      (29 )    15,569      18,166      (14 )      Interest expense      2,510      2,297      9      7,955      4,902      62        Restructuring expenses and related asset impairment and other expenses      371      -      -      1,076      -      -        Other expenses      2,681      2,815      (5 )    7,490      8,478      (12 )            Total benefits, claims and expenses      26,256      29,083      (10 )    81,288      83,067      (2 )          Loss before income tax benefit      (207 )    (28,185 )    -      (5,256 )    (48,205 )    -      Income tax benefit      (192 )    (3,480 )    -      (1,953 )    (10,374 )    -            Net income (loss)      (15 )    (24,705 )    -      (3,303 )    (37,831 )    -      Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest      (470 )    (237 )    -      (1,227 )    (201 )    -            Net income (loss) attributable to AIG    $ 455    $ (24,468 )    - %  $ (2,076 )  $ (37,630 )    - %            Premiums and Other Considerations   Premiums and other considerations decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:    •a reduction of $2.6 billion and $4.5 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, respectively, from dispositions, including the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008, sales of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) and 21st Century in 2009 and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic in 2009;   •a decline in Commercial Insurance reflecting the economy's continued effect on the construction, environmental and transportation lines of businesses, which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects and a decline in the workers' compensation line of business due to lower payrolls and AIG's strategy to remain price disciplined in this business;   •a decrease in Foreign General Insurance due to negative effect of foreign exchange, the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008 noted above and lower premiums in Europe, the U.K. and Far East regions;   •a decrease in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services primarily due to lower sales and deposits, the sale of the Brazilian operations, the effect of foreign exchange translation, the effect of equity markets on investment-linked and annuity products globally; and   111      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   •a decrease in Domestic Life Insurance premiums, primarily due to lower payout annuities and the sale of AIG Life Canada.

Policyholder trading losses are offset by a change in policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets, principally in Japan and Asia;   •gains of $224 million and $1.2 billion for the third quarter of 2009 associated with the changes in fair value of AIG's interests in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and ML III, respectively;   •a small trading account gain for the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services business in the U.K. associated with certain investment-linked products compared to a large loss in the same period of 2008; and   •gains from partnership investments and mutual funds reflecting stronger market conditions in 2009 than in 2008.    These increases were partially offset by:    •lower levels of invested assets in 2009 compared to 2008; and   •lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments that were held for liquidity purposes.     Net investment income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:    •increased policyholder investment income and trading gains and losses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services as noted above;   •gains associated with the change in fair value of AIG's investment in ML III of $223 million in 2009; and   •gains from mutual fund investments reflecting stronger market conditions in 2009 than in 2008.   112      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  These increases were partially offset by:    •losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG's interests in ML II of $116 million in 2009;   •lower levels of invested assets in 2009 compared to 2008; and   •lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments that were held for liquidity purposes.

The 2008 periods included non-credit impairments (i.e. severity losses) that are no longer required for fixed maturity securities due to the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard. Additionally, other-than-temporary impairments declined from the 2008 periods due to improved market conditions, principally in the second and third quarters of 2009. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Investments — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. See also out of period adjustments discussion in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Unrealized Market Valuation Gains (Losses) on AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio   AIGFP reported unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $959 million and $1.1 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, respectively, and unrealized market valuation losses of $7.1 billion and $21.7 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008, respectively. The change in the unrealized market valuation gains (losses) related to AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio was due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 associated with the ML III transaction, the improvement in market conditions in 2009 as well as the narrowing of corporate credit spreads. See Financial Services Operations — Capital Markets Results; Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities; Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2008 Financial Statements.   Other Income (Loss)   Other income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $730 million in 2009 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $1.1 billion in 2008 on AIGFP's assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value, partially  113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries offset by a decline in Institutional Asset Management revenues due to impairments on proprietary real estate and private equity investments of $674 million as well as lower base management fees on lower base assets under management in 2009.   Other income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to:    •a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $2.4 billion in 2009 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $1.6 billion in 2008 on AIGFP's assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value; and   •an improvement of $1.1 billion reflecting the positive effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting, which was driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies during 2009.    This increase was partially offset by:    •a $2.1 billion decline in Institutional Asset Management revenues due to impairments on proprietary real estate and private equity investments and lower base management fees noted above;   •a decline of $1.1 billion in income from consolidated managed partnerships and funds, which is offset in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest;   •lower finance charges and other revenues in AGF reflecting the sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF's liquidity management efforts; and   •a decline in spread-based revenue due to runoff of the GIC business.    Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred   Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to:    •a reduction of $1.9 billion from dispositions, primarily the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008, sales of HSB and 21st Century in 2009 and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic in 2009; and   •catastrophe-related losses of $55 million in 2009 compared to $1.4 billion in 2008. Losses in 2008 primarily related to hurricanes Ike and Gustav.    These decreases were partially offset by an increase in incurred policy losses and benefits expenses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services due to policyholder trading gains of $1.4 billion in 2009 compared to policyholder trading losses of $1.5 billion in 2008 as discussed above in Net Investment Income.   Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to:    •a reduction of $3.6 billion from dispositions, primarily the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008, sales of HSB and 21st Century in 2009 and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic in 2009;   •catastrophe-related losses of $55 million in 2009 compared to $1.5 billion in 2008; and    These decreases were partially offset by:    •an increase in incurred policy losses and benefits expenses for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services due to policyholder trading gains of $3.3 billion in 2009 compared to policyholder trading losses of $1.6 billion in 2008 as discussed above in Net Investment Income; and   •adverse development from prior years in Commercial Insurance and increased current year losses in Foreign General Insurance from exposure to financial lines claims.   114      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Policy Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses   Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:    •a reduction of $780 million from dispositions, primarily the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008, sales of HSB and 21st Century in 2009 and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic in 2009;   •the decline in production levels for General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services; and   •a premium deficiency reserve of $453 million established in the third quarter of 2008 related to UGC's second-lien business.    Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:    •a reduction of $1.3 billion from dispositions noted above;   •the decline in production levels for General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services; and   •a premium deficiency reserve of $453 million in 2008 noted above.    Interest Expense   Interest expense increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to interest expense on the FRBNY Facility. Interest expense on the FRBNY Facility was $1.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and included $822 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, of amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset and $430 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, of accrued compounding interest. During 2009, interest expense benefited from a reduced interest rate on the FRBNY Facility; however, because the facility was outstanding for the full quarter in 2009 compared to only 15 days in 2008, the interest expense in the 2009 period was higher than in the 2008 period. These amounts are reflected in the Other category in AIG's segment results.   Restructuring Expenses and Related Asset Impairment and Other Expenses   In the fourth quarter of 2008, AIG commenced an organization-wide restructuring plan under which some of its businesses are being divested, some will be held for later divestiture, some are being prepared for potential offerings to the public and some will be retained. In connection with activities under this plan, AIG recorded restructuring and separation expenses of $371 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, consisting of severance expenses of $57 million, contract termination expenses of $1 million, asset write-downs of $97 million, other exit expenses of $78 million and separation expenses of $138 million. AIG recorded restructuring and separation expenses of $1.1 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, consisting of severance expenses of $138 million, contract termination expenses of $40 million, asset write-downs of $118 million, other exit expenses of $359 million, and separation expenses of $421 million.   Other exit expenses primarily include professional fees related to (i) disposition activities, (ii) AIG's capital restructuring program with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury and (iii) unwinding of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios.   Severance and separation expenses described above include retention awards of $126 million and $407 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, respectively, to key employees to maintain ongoing business operations and facilitate the successful execution of the restructuring and asset disposition plan. The awards under these retention plans were granted in 2008 and are accrued ratably over the future service periods, which range from 2008 to 2011. The total amount expected to be incurred related to these 2008 retention plans is approximately $1.1 billion. AIG made payments to the employees under these plans in 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 and expects to make further payments for the remainder of 2009 through 2011. The ultimate amount paid could be less primarily due to the effect of forfeitures.  115      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries Amounts charged to expense, and expected to be charged to expense, and the total amounts expected to be incurred under the 2008 retention plans, by operating segment, are as follows:                                     (In millions)   General Insurance   Life Insurance & Retirement Services   Financial Services   Asset Management   Other   Total            Amounts charged to expense:                                            Three months ended September 30, 2009   $ 30   $ 33   $ 48   $ 8   $ 7   $ 126        Nine months ended September 30, 2009     99     111     139     23     35     407      Cumulative incurred since inception of restructuring plan(a)     182     164     426     70     108     950      Amounts expected to be incurred in future periods:                                            Remainder of 2009     18     28     31     5     8     90        2010     7     16     -     -     2     25        2011     -     1     -     -     -     1            Total amounts expected to be incurred in future periods     25     45     31     5     10     116            Total amounts expected to be incurred   $ 207   $ 209   $ 457   $ 75   $ 118   $ 1,066 (b)             (a)Includes an adjustment of $51 million in Financial Services to increase the cumulative amount incurred since inception for retention amounts paid in 2008. (b)At September 30, 2009, remaining amounts payable totaled $515 million.   Total restructuring and separation expenses could have a material effect on future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.   See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses.   Other Expenses   Other expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 was essentially unchanged compared to the same period in 2008. Other expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in compensation-related costs resulting from the deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of Private Bank in the Asset Management segment and lower interest expense on GICs, partially offset by increased goodwill impairments in the Asset Management segment.   Income Taxes (Benefits)   The effective tax rates on pre-tax losses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 were 92.8 percent and 37.1 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates were higher than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to tax exempt interest and the change in estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance and reserve for uncertain tax positions.   At September 30, 2009, AIG reported a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $6.8 billion. This asset was net of $3.9 billion of net deferred tax liabilities related to foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns and $0.5 billion of deferred tax liabilities on available for sale securities which are evaluated separately. Management determined, based on its assessments of future earnings, principally related to AIG's divestiture plan, that it is more likely than not that the remaining $11.2 billion net deferred tax asset is realizable.   Realization of AIG's net deferred tax asset depends on AIG's ability to consummate the proposed AIA and ALICO transactions and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred.  116      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG's consolidated financial condition or its results of operations.   When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at September 30, 2009, AIG considered all available evidence, including (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed to date and additional actions expected to be completed, (iii) the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (iv) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving greater weight to discrete sources and to earlier years in the forecast period, and (v) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate taxable amounts. Management has also considered the period during which it expects to receive support from the FRBNY.   The effective tax rates on the pre-tax losses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 were 12.3 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to $3.6 billion of deferred tax expense attributable to the potential sale of foreign businesses and a $3.3 billion valuation allowance to reduce tax benefits on capital losses to the amount that AIG believes is more likely than not to be realized.   See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance.

For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, the effect was $121 million and $18 million, respectively, in both revenues and operating income (loss). These amounts result primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives that are effective economic hedges of investments and borrowings. (e)Includes unrealized market valuation gains of $959 million and losses of $7.1 billion for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and gains of $1.1 billion and losses of $21.7 billion for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.   General Insurance Operations   AIG's General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad.   Commercial Insurance writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Commercial Insurance the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Commercial Insurance without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit Commercial Insurance to accept a risk.   AIG's Foreign General insurance group writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of branches and foreign based insurance subsidiaries. Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. Foreign General insurance group operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, the U.K., Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.   In order to better align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers manage their businesses, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the results for Transatlantic, Personal Lines (excluding the results of the Private Client Group), and Mortgage Guaranty, previously reported as part of the General Insurance operating segment, are now included in AIG's Other operations. In addition, the historical results of HSB (which was sold on March 31, 2009), which were previously included in Commercial Insurance, are also now included in AIG's Other operations.

Quarterly General Insurance Results   General Insurance reported operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss in the same period in 2008 due to a significant increase in net investment income and the absence of realized capital losses in 2009, which more than offset an increased underwriting loss.   General Insurance net premiums written decreased 13 percent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Net premiums written were affected by foreign exchange rates and a decline in U.S. workers' compensation premiums due to lower payrolls and a strategy to remain price disciplined. General Insurance net premiums written also declined due to the previous sale of the Brazilian operations.  120      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  The combined ratio for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 was 6.4 points lower than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2008 due to lower catastrophe losses in the current year, partially offset by premium rate decreases and changes in loss trends. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $246 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 and decreased incurred losses by $189 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2008. Catastrophes increased incurred losses by $55 million and $1.2 billion in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Year-to-Date General Insurance Results   General Insurance operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to lower net realized capital losses from other-than-temporary impairments on investments, which more than offset a significant deterioration in underwriting results.   General Insurance net premiums written decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Net premiums written were affected by foreign exchange rates, the U.S. construction, real estate and transportation lines of business, which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects, and a decline in U.S. workers' compensation premiums due to lower payrolls and a strategy to remain price disciplined. General Insurance net premiums written also declined due to the previous sale of the Brazilian operations.   The combined ratio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 was 0.8 points lower than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 due to lower catastrophe losses in the current year, partially offset by premium rate decreases and changes in loss trends. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $478 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 and decreased incurred losses by $341 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008. The net adverse development for 2009 includes $172 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies compared to $339 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies in the same period in 2008. The favorable development related to loss sensitive policies had no effect on underwriting profit as it was entirely offset by a decline in earned premiums. For the first nine months of 2009 the current accident year combined ratio was 97.5 percent.   See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results for further discussion on Net investment income and Realized capital gains (losses).   Quarterly Commercial Insurance Results   Commercial Insurance operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 mainly due to an increase in net investment income and lower net realized capital losses.   Commercial Insurance net premiums written decreased 11 percent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The decline can be attributed to the construction, real estate and transportation lines of businesses, which were negatively affected more than other AIG lines by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects, and a decline in the workers' compensation line of business due to lower payrolls and a strategy to remain price disciplined, as well as to the overall state of the weakened economy.   The loss ratio recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 decreased compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 was 10.4 points lower than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2008 due to lower catastrophe losses in the current year, partially offset by premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends. Net prior year development increased incurred losses by $256 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 and decreased incurred losses by $140 million in the three-month period  121      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  ended September 30, 2008. Catastrophes increased incurred losses by $55 million and $1.1 billion in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   The expense ratio decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Overall expenses were down $107 million, or 9 percent from prior year due to continued focus on variable expenses, partially offset by higher pension costs and other restructuring charges.   Year-to-Date Commercial Insurance Results   Commercial Insurance operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses from other-than-temporary impairments on investments, which more than offset an underwriting loss.   Net premiums written decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to declines in workers' compensation premiums and the construction, real estate and transportation lines of businesses as described above. Net premiums written were also adversely affected by AIG's negative publicity in the current year.   The loss ratio recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 was 2.4 points lower than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 due to lower catastrophe losses in the current year, partially offset by premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $482 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 and reduced incurred losses by $276 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008. The net adverse development includes favorable development related to loss sensitive policies of $172 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 and $339 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008. For the first nine months of 2009, the current accident year combined ratio was 98.0.   The expense ratio remained flat in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Overall expenses were down $442 million, or 12 percent from prior year due to lower variable expenses, partially offset by higher pension costs and other restructuring costs.   Foreign General Insurance Results  AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Foreign General Insurance net premiums written:                                  Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          2009   2008   2009   2008            Increase (decrease) in original currency*      (13.2 )%    4.2 %    (12.2 )%    6.8 %    Foreign exchange effect      (2.5 )    7.3      (6.0 )    8.8            Increase (decrease) as reported in U.S. dollars      (15.7 )%    11.5 %    (18.2 )%    15.6 %             *Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.    Quarterly Foreign General Insurance Results   Foreign General Insurance operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to an increase in net investment income related to improving equity mutual fund income as a result of the stronger performance in the equity markets offset by an underwriting loss.   Net premiums written decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The effect of foreign exchange contributed to 2.5 percent of this decline and the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008 contributed to 9.3 percent of the decline. Net premiums written for the Lloyd's syndicate Ascot  122      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  exhibited strong growth in the third quarter due to an improved rate environment and contributed to the highest levels of core production growth in Foreign General Insurance since September 2008. However, the negative effect of the economic downturn and customer de-risking continues to have a negative effect on net premium growth. The consumer lines business was affected by the continued global recessionary pressure reducing the number of overseas travelers and auto sales, particularly in the Far East region.   The loss ratio in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased by 2.0 points compared to the same period in 2008. The third quarter 2009 loss ratio was primarily negatively affected by the increased loss activity arising from the recent disruption in the financial markets as well as financial frauds (6.4 points), while the same period in 2008 was affected by natural catastrophes Hurricane Ike and Gustav (3.6 points). The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the third quarter of 2009 was higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the third quarter of 2008 reflecting an increased actuarial adjustment to the loss estimates made in the current quarter including adjustments to the first and second quarters of 2009.   The expense ratio increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to increased separation costs, restructuring charges, certain bad debt-related expenses, pension costs, as well as lower earned premiums.   Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Results   Foreign General Insurance operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in underwriting profit offset by an increase in net investment income reflecting higher equity mutual fund income related to stronger performance in the equity markets.   Net premiums written decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The effect of foreign exchange contributed to 6.0 percent of this decline and the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008 contributed to 7.2 percent of the decline. The Europe region maintained strong client and policy retention in the third quarter and continues to return to historical levels. In the Far East operations, the economic downturn continued to negatively affect new business in the consumer lines portfolio.   The loss ratio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased by 2.3 points compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting claim increases in the financial institutions professional indemnity book as a result of the credit crisis, continued exposure to credit and fraud claims along with higher claims frequency in major markets. For the first nine months of 2009 the current accident year combined ratio was 96.4 percent.   The expense ratio increased in the nine- month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to increased separation costs, restructuring charges, certain costs associated with bad debt-related expenses, pension costs, as well as lower earned premiums.   Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense   The following discussion on the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for the Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance reporting units in the General Insurance operating segment and loss reserves pertaining to divested and/or noncore businesses, comprising the Transatlantic, Personal Lines and Mortgage Guaranty reporting units reported in AIG's Other category.  123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table presents the components of the loss reserves by major lines of business on a statutory annual statement basis(a):                         (in millions)   September 30, 2009   December 31, 2008            Other liability occurrence    $ 19,086    $ 19,773      Workers' compensation      14,537      15,170      Other liability claims made      12,249      13,189      International      12,058      11,786      Auto liability      3,939      5,593      Property      3,958      5,201      Mortgage Guaranty/Credit      5,059      3,137      Reinsurance      133      3,102      Products liability      2,338      2,400      Medical malpractice      1,620      2,210      Aircraft      1,381      1,693      Accident and health      1,590      1,451      Commercial multiple peril      1,060      1,163      Fidelity/surety      867      1,028      Other      1,724      2,362            Total(b)    $ 81,599    $ 89,258               (a)Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. (b)The decrease from the December 31, 2008 loss reserve amount was primarily due to the deconsolidation of Transatlantic.   AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves (IBNR) and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are currently reflected in operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   Estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based upon historical reporting trends. Mortgage Guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability (for each delinquent loan reported) that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency, cure rates, dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan. Because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events, such as changes in home price appreciation or depreciation, interest rates and unemployment, the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans. Consistent with industry practice, AIG does not establish a reserve for insured loans that are not currently delinquent, but that may become delinquent in future periods.   At September 30, 2009, net loss reserves decreased $7.58 billion from the prior year-end to $64.87 billion primarily due to dispositions. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table classifies the components of the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense by business unit:                         (in millions)   September 30, 2009   December 31, 2008            General Insurance segment:                    Commercial Insurance(a)    $ 48,535    $ 48,896        Foreign General Insurance      11,904      10,853            Total General Insurance      60,439      59,749            Noncore businesses:                    Transatlantic(b)      -      7,349        21st Century(a)(b)      -      2,065        Mortgage Guaranty      4,434      3,004        HSB(b)      -      288            Total noncore businesses      4,434      12,706            Total net loss reserves    $ 64,873    $ 72,455             (a)December 31, 2008 balances have been revised to reclassify Private Client Group into Commercial Insurance.

Discounting of Reserves   At September 30, 2009, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.57 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in AIRCO that was written by Commercial Insurance is discounted based on the yield of Department of the Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the Commercial Insurance payout pattern for this business. The discount is comprised of the following: $733 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance; $1.7 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in Commercial Insurance; $140 million — non-tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO for Commercial Insurance business. Since 1998, AIRCO has assumed on a quota share basis certain general liability and products liability business written by Commercial Insurance, and the reserves for this business are carried on a discounted basis by AIRCO.   Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that the net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of September 30, 2009. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of September 30, 2009. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  125                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves:                                    Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,      (in millions)   2009   2008   2009   2008            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of period    $ 65,770    $ 72,331    $ 72,455    $ 69,288      Foreign exchange effect      245      (765 )    1,035      (502 )    Dispositions*      (1,819 )    -      (9,657 )    -            Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                Current year      6,407      9,723      21,206      26,364        Prior years, other than accretion of discount      191      (144 )    526      (215 )      Prior years, accretion of discount      98      79      294      255            Losses and loss expenses incurred      6,696      9,658      22,026      26,404            Losses and loss expenses paid      6,019      7,471      20,986      21,437            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 64,873    $ 73,753    $ 64,873    $ 73,753             *Transatlantic was deconsolidated during the second quarter of 2009, 21st Century was sold in the third quarter of 2009; and HSB was sold during the first quarter of 2009.

For example, if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years, AIG's actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the profit center's reserves for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   2009 Net Loss Development  Quarterly Development   In the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years, excluding $98 million from accretion of loss reserve discount, was adverse by approximately $246 million due to adverse development of:    •$115 million relating to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance, primarily from accident years 2005 and prior;   •$68 million pertaining to certain reinsurance commutations within Commercial Insurance relating to accident years 2002 and prior;   •$39 million pertaining to excess workers compensation business within Commercial Insurance relating to accident years 2002 and prior; and   •$29 million pertaining to asbestos within Commercial Insurance and Foreign General, largely attributable to one defendant.    AIG's total net loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, including noncore businesses, was adverse by approximately $191 million. The noncore businesses prior year development includes $55 million of favorable development from Mortgage Guaranty.  127      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Year-to-date Development   In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years, excluding $294 million from accretion of loss reserve discount, was adverse by approximately $478 million due to adverse development of:    •$420 million relating to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance, related to accident years 2006 and prior, which was attributable to loss emergence significantly in excess of the historical loss emergence pattern for this class of business;   •$115 million pertaining to certain reinsurance commutations within Commercial insurance, relating to accident years 2002 and prior;   •$80 million pertaining to a surety claim within Commercial Insurance from accident year 2007;   •$75 million pertaining to asbestos claims from accident years 2002 and prior, primarily relating to Commercial Insurance; and   •$50 million pertaining to excess workers compensation within Commercial Insurance, relating to accident years 2002 and prior.    The adverse development was partially offset by favorable development of:   •$150 million from Lexington within Commercial Insurance, pertaining to $270 million favorable development from Lexington's healthcare, CAT excess, and casualty businesses related primarily to accident years 2002 through 2007, offset by approximately $120 million of adverse development in Lexington's property businesses relating primarily to accident year 2008; and   •$170 million relating to loss sensitive business within Commercial Insurance; however, Commercial Insurance underwriting result did not benefit due to a corresponding reduction to net earned premiums.   AIG's total net loss development from prior accident years for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, including noncore businesses, was adverse by approximately $526 million. Mortgage Guaranty accounted for approximately $73 million of adverse development, relating primarily to accident year 2008.   2008 Net Loss Development  Quarterly Development   In the three-month period ended September 30, 2008, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years, excluding $79 million from accretion of loss reserve discount, was favorable by approximately $189 million due to favorable development of:    •$140 million from business written within Commercial Insurance by Lexington, including casualty, catastrophic casualty, healthcare and program business;   •$120 million from accident years 2001 and prior as the result of the commutation of one large account within Commercial Insurance; and   •$105 million as a result of an update in the third quarter of 2008 of AIG's ground up projections of claims exposure for the D&O and related management liability classes of business within AIG Executive Liability. AIG utilized the ultimate loss estimates resulting from these claims projections as a benchmark in determining the appropriate loss reserves for this business. The third quarter results reflected approximately $185 million of favorable development from accident years 2004 through 2006, partially offset by approximately $80 million of adverse development from accident years 2000 through 2002.    The favorable development was partially offset by adverse development of $170 million from excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance, primarily from accident years 2003 and prior. This adverse development relating to excess casualty reflected continued emergence of latent claims such as construction defect, product  128      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  aggregate, and pharmaceutical related exposures, as well as higher than expected large loss activity from these accident years.   AIG's total net loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended September 30, 2008, including noncore businesses, was favorable by approximately $144 million. The noncore business prior year development included $69 million of adverse development from Mortgage Guaranty in the three-month period ended September 30, 2008, reflecting the adverse claims environment, including $77 million of adverse development from accident year 2007.  Year-to-date Development   In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years was favorable by approximately $341 million, including $339 million of favorable development relating to loss sensitive business in the first three months of 2008 (which was offset by an equal amount of negative earned premium development), and excluding $255 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. Excluding both the favorable development relating to loss sensitive business and accretion of loss reserve discount, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, was favorable by $2 million. The overall favorable development of $341 million consisted of favorable development of:    •$339 million from loss sensitive business written by commercial casualty within Commercial Insurance;   •$400 million from business written by Lexington, including healthcare, catastrophic casualty, casualty and program businesses; and   •$250 million from accident years 2004 and 2005 from executive liability business within Commercial Insurance, partially offset by adverse development from earlier accident years.    The favorable development was partially offset by adverse development of approximately $485 million from excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance, reflecting a variety of other latent claims and large losses. AIG's exposure to these latent exposures was reduced after 2002 due to significant changes in policy terms and conditions as well as underwriting guidelines. The excess casualty developments included approximately $175 million from claims related to MTBE, a gasoline additive, on claims from accident years 2000 and prior.   AIG's total net loss development from prior accident years for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, including noncore businesses, was favorable by approximately $215 million. The noncore business prior year development included adverse development from 21st Century and Mortgage Guaranty. Mortgage Guaranty contributed $126 million of overall adverse development in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, with $119 million relating to accident year 2007.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.   As described more fully in the 2008 Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, a moderate amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the table that follows. This development was primarily attributable to several large defendants.  129      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined appears in the table below. The vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years. The current environmental policies that AIG underwrites on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the table below.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The September 30, 2009 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at September 30, 2008 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at September 30, 2009 by approximately 0.8 years and 1.9 years, respectively, and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at September 30, 2008 by approximately 1.2 years and 2.7 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.   AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three-year average payment and were as follows:                          Nine Months Ended September 30,   Gross   Net              2009                  Survival ratios:                      Asbestos     4.5     3.6        Environmental     4.3     3.3          Combined     4.4     3.6            2008                    Survival ratios:                    Asbestos     5.3     4.1          Environmental     4.6     3.7        Combined     5.2     4.0              Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations   AIG's Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad.

Quarterly Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Total revenues increased significantly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, due to lower net realized capital losses and higher net investment income. Net investment income benefited from higher policyholder trading gains; income from partnerships, mutual funds and AIG's investment in ML II; and lower U.K. trading losses compared to the same period in 2008. See Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations, Net Investment Income and Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) for further discussion.   Operating income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the lower net realized capital losses and higher net investment income. Other items positively affecting the three-month periods were:    •Losses of $38 million in 2009 compared to losses of $501 million in 2008 related to trading gains (losses) and change in benefit reserves associated with investment-oriented products in the U.K.;   •partnership and mutual fund income, net of policyholder trading gains and participating policyholder share, of $174 million in 2009 compared to losses of $916 million in 2008, partially offset by lower equity dividends in Taiwan of $104 million in 2009 due to de-risking of the investment portfolio;   •an increase of $224 million in the fair value of the investment in ML II; and   •DAC and SIA charges and related reserve strengthening of $728 million in 2008 for Domestic Retirement Services.    These increases were partially offset by:    •actuarial charges for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services related to unlocking of assumptions and changes in estimates of $202 million in 2009 compared to $38 million in 2008, including DAC charges in Korea due to higher than anticipated surrenders related to a specific product and charges of $91 million related to the continued project to increase standardization of AIG's actuarial systems and processes throughout the world;   •DAC and SIA benefit related to net realized capital gains of $32 million in 2009 compared to a DAC and SIA benefit of $478 million in 2008;   •lower assets under management in the investment-oriented and retirement services portfolios; and   •higher expenses related to restructuring activities, including a $91 million impairment charge in 2009 for capitalized costs in Japan related to the decision to terminate the previously scheduled merger of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life.    Year-to-Date Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Total revenues increased significantly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to lower net realized capital losses and higher net investment income. Net investment income benefited from higher policyholder trading gains, lower partnership and mutual fund losses and lower U.K. trading losses. See Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations, Net Investment Income and Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) for further discussion.  134      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Life Insurance & Retirement Services reported a lower operating loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to considerably lower net realized capital losses and:    •Losses of $60 million in 2009 compared to trading losses of $722 million in 2008 related to trading gains (losses) and change in benefit reserves associated with investment-oriented products in the U.K.;   •partnership and mutual fund losses, net of policyholder trading gains and participating policyholder share, of $23 million in 2009 compared to losses of $777 million in 2008; partially offset by lower equity dividends in Taiwan of $105 million in 2009 due to de-risking of the investment portfolio; and   •DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $601 million in the first nine months of 2009 in the Domestic Retirement Services operations resulting from a reduction in the long-term growth rates assumptions used to determine DAC amortization and related to expected higher surrenders; the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 included DAC and SIA charges and related reserve strengthening of $728 million.    These improvements were partially offset by:    •actuarial charges for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services related to unlocking of assumptions and changes in estimates of $215 million in 2009 compared to $30 million in 2008, including DAC charges in Korea due to higher than anticipated surrenders related to a certain product and charges of $91 million related to the continued project to increase standardization of AIG's actuarial systems and processes throughout the world;   •DAC and SIA benefits related to net realized capital losses of $537 million in 2009 compared to $957 million in 2008;   •a $134 million loss recognition charge for the Philippine operations;   •decrease of $116 million in the fair value of the economic interest in ML II;   •lower investment margins due to de-risking activities and higher short-term liquidity; and   •higher expenses related to restructuring activities including a $91 million impairment charge in 2009 for capitalized costs in Japan related to the decision to terminate the previously scheduled merger of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life.   135      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services results on a sub-product basis were as follows:                                    (in millions)   Premiums and Other Considerations   Net Investment Income   Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)   Total Revenues   Operating Income (Loss)              Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                                      Life insurance   $ 3,874   $ 2,257   $ 156   $ 6,287   $ 790          Personal accident     1,792     108     4     1,904     348        Group products     768     114     (51 )   831     48          Individual fixed annuities     119     637     (91 )   665     (17 )      Individual variable annuities     69     707     -     776     (15 )                Total   $ 6,622   $ 3,823   $ 18   $ 10,463   $ 1,154            Three Months Ended September 30, 2008                                        Life insurance   $ 4,282   $ 164   $ (3,078 ) $ 1,368   $ (2,490 )      Personal accident     1,788     124     (71 )   1,841     323          Group products     962     124     (47 )   1,039     83        Individual fixed annuities     221     621     (258 )   584     (33 )        Individual variable annuities     106     (559 )   (1 )   (454 )   (376 )              Total   $ 7,359   $ 474   $ (3,455 ) $ 4,378   $ (2,493 )            Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                      Life insurance      (10 )%   - %   - %   360 %   - %        Personal accident     -     (13 )   -     3     8        Group products     (20 )   (8 )   -     (20 )   (42 )        Individual fixed annuities     (46 )   3     -     14     -        Individual variable annuities     (35 )   -     -     -     -                  Total      (10 )%   - %   - %   139 %   - %          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                                        Life insurance   $ 12,436   $ 6,495   $ (24 ) $ 18,907   $ 1,851        Personal accident     5,266     317     (44 )   5,539     1,042          Group products     2,208     284     (58 )   2,434     211        Individual fixed annuities     307     1,840     (780 )   1,367     (281 )        Individual variable annuities     182     1,128     3     1,313     26                Total   $ 20,399   $ 10,064   $ (903 ) $ 29,560   $ 2,849              Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008                                      Life insurance   $ 13,428   $ 2,896   $ (4,395 ) $ 11,929   $ (2,007 )        Personal accident     5,334     325     (137 )   5,522     1,086        Group products     2,960     521     (88 )   3,393     289          Individual fixed annuities     429     1,850     (486 )   1,793     69        Individual variable annuities     346     (508 )   20     (142 )   (422 )                Total   $ 22,497   $ 5,084   $ (5,086 ) $ 22,495   $ (985 )          Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                        Life insurance      (7 )%   124 %   - %   58 %   - %      Personal accident     (1 )   (2 )   -     -     (4 )        Group products     (25 )   (45 )   -     (28 )   (27 )      Individual fixed annuities     (28 )   (1 )   -     (24 )   -          Individual variable annuities     (47 )   -     -     -     -                Total      (9 )%   98 %   - %   31 %   - %           136      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies and therefore premiums and other considerations reported in U.S. dollars vary by volume and changes in foreign currency translation rates.

Quarterly Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Total revenues for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to net realized capital gains of $18 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to net realized capital losses of $3.5 billion in the same period of 2008, along with higher policyholder trading gains, partially offset by lower premiums and other considerations and the effect of the sale of the Brazil operations. See Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).   Operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the change to net realized capital gains from losses shown above and:    •Losses of $38 million in 2009 compared to trading losses of $501 million in 2008 related to trading gains (losses) and change in benefit reserves associated with investment-oriented products in the U.K.; and   •partnership and mutual fund income, net of policyholder trading gains and policyholder participating share, of $74 million in 2009 compared to losses of $380 million in 2008 partially offset by lower equity dividends of $104 million in Taiwan in 2009 due to de-risking of the investment portfolio.    These increases were partially offset by:    •actuarial charges related to unlocking of assumptions and changes in estimates of $202 million in 2009 compared to $38 million for 2008, including DAC charges in Korea in 2009 due to higher than anticipated surrenders related to a certain product and the actuarial charges of $91 million discussed above;   •lower assets under management in investment-linked and retirement services portfolios in the U.K. and Japan;   •the sale of the Brazil operations on November 30, 2008; and   •higher expenses due to restructuring activities, including the $91 million impairment of capitalized costs in Japan discussed above.   137                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Year-to-Date Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results   Total revenues for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses along with higher policyholder trading gains, partially offset by lower premiums and other considerations and the effect of the sale of the Brazil operations.

The sequential increases stemmed primarily from Asia where sales of investment-linked life insurance products have improved. First year premium sales for Japan have declined compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the phase-out of sales incentives and uncertainty related to restructuring activities. First year premium sales were also negatively affected by foreign exchange translation.   Similar to first year premium sales, single premium sales in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the first and second quarters of 2009 but declined significantly compared to the same period in 2008. The sequential increases reflected improvements in Japan's life insurance and personal accident sales and Singapore's life insurance sales. The single premium sales decline compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2008 was primarily due to lower guaranteed income bond deposits in the U.K. resulting from poor market conditions and the effect of the adverse publicity surrounding AIG. This decline was partially offset by higher single premium sales in Asia, which increased compared to the same period in 2008, reflecting strong new business growth, particularly in Singapore.   Annuity deposits decreased significantly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the decline in individual variable annuity deposits. Variable annuity deposits in the U.K. decreased significantly compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2008 resulting from declines in the U.K. Premier Access Bond product following significant surrender activity as a result of AIG events. Adverse publicity surrounding AIG and the uncertainty of AIG's Japan life operations restructuring continued to negatively affect deposits in Japan during the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 due to the suspension of sales by banks. While some banks in Japan have resumed sales of annuity products, most have not. AIG has, therefore, focused its efforts to sell annuity deposit products through agents.   Year-to-Date Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Sales and Deposits   First year premium sales in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 declined compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to decreases in life insurance and personal accident sales which were partially offset by higher group products sales. Life insurance sales of investment-linked products in Asia were adversely affected by equity market performance and the negative effect of foreign exchange translation. Life insurance sales in Japan increased as a result of sales incentives and the positive effect of foreign exchange translation while personal accident sales declined. Group product sales increased primarily due to large group cases in Australia.   Single premium sales in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 declined significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower guaranteed income bond deposits in the U.K. resulting from poor market conditions and the effect of the adverse publicity surrounding AIG. In Japan, single premium sales declined primarily due to the temporary suspension of sales by banks. Single premium sales also decreased in Asia reflecting customers concerns about equity markets performance earlier in the year.   Annuity deposits decreased significantly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the decline in individual variable annuity deposits in the U.K. and individual fixed annuity deposits in Japan. Investment-linked deposits in the U.K. decreased significantly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 resulting from declines in the U.K. Premier Access Bond product following significant surrender activity as a result of AIG events. Adverse publicity surrounding AIG and the uncertainty of AIG's Japan life operations restructuring continued to negatively affect deposits in Japan during the first nine months of 2009 due to the suspension of sales by banks.  139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Domestic Life Insurance Results  Domestic Life Insurance results, presented on a sub-product basis were as follows:                                   (in millions)   Premiums and Other Considerations   Net Investment Income   Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)   Total Revenues   Operating Income (Loss)            Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                                      Life insurance   $ 551   $ 420   $ (306 ) $ 665   $ (60 )      Home service     181     164     12     357     92        Group life/health     180     48     (9 )   219     8        Payout annuities*     94     292     (1 )   385     28        Individual fixed and runoff annuities     6     88     (25 )   69     3                Total   $ 1,012   $ 1,012   $ (329 ) $ 1,695   $ 71            Three Months Ended September 30, 2008                                      Life insurance   $ 667   $ 331   $ (3,471 ) $ (2,473 ) $ (3,176 )      Home service     189     161     (577 )   (227 )   (486 )      Group life/health     211     49     (64 )   196     (70 )      Payout annuities*     639     327     (211 )   755     (154 )      Individual fixed and runoff annuities     8     105     (68 )   45     (25 )              Total   $ 1,714   $ 973   $ (4,391 ) $ (1,704 ) $ (3,911 )          Percentage Increase (Decrease) from Prior Year:                                      Life insurance      (17 )%   27 %   - %   - %   - %      Home service     (4 )   2     -     -     -        Group life/health     (15 )   (2 )   -     12     -        Payout annuities     (85 )   (11 )   -     (49 )   -        Individual fixed and runoff annuities     (25 )   (16 )   -     53     -                Total      (41 )%   4 %   - %   - %   - %          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                                      Life insurance   $ 1,775   $ 930   $ (356 ) $ 2,349   $ 82        Home service     546     459     (82 )   923     125        Group life/health     573     148     (36 )   685     26        Payout annuities*     324     934     (88 )   1,170     50        Individual fixed and runoff annuities     35     294     (54 )   275     27                Total   $ 3,253   $ 2,765   $ (616 ) $ 5,402   $ 310            Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008                                      Life insurance   $ 1,877   $ 1,069   $ (5,636 ) $ (2,690 ) $ (4,933 )      Home service     563     477     (915 )   125     (660 )      Group life/health     633     144     (91 )   686     (64 )      Payout annuities*     1,797     950     (266 )   2,481     (99 )      Individual fixed and runoff annuities     35     323     (147 )   211     (30 )              Total   $ 4,905   $ 2,963   $ (7,055 ) $ 813   $ (5,786 )          Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                      Life insurance      (5 )%    (13 )%   - %   - %   - %      Home service     (3 )   (4 )   -     -     -        Group life/health     (9 )   3     -     -     -        Payout annuities     (82 )   (2 )   -     (53 )   -        Individual fixed and runoff annuities     -     (9 )   -     30     -                Total      (34 )%    (7 )%   - %   - %   - %             *Premiums and other considerations include structured settlements, single premium immediate annuities and terminal funding annuities.   140      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries     Quarterly Domestic Life Insurance Results   Total revenues for Domestic Life Insurance increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses of $329 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to losses of $4.4 billion in 2008 and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower premiums and other considerations. See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Losses and Investments.   Domestic Life Insurance reported operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 of $71 million compared to an operating loss of $3.9 billion in the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments and higher net investment income partially offset by lower premiums and other considerations due to lower payout annuities, the sale of AIG Life Canada and higher DAC amortization due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges. Higher net investment income was primarily due to a $78 million increase in the fair value of the investment in ML II, partially offset by reduced overall investment yields from increased levels of short-term investments and lower partnership income.   Year-to-Date Domestic Life Insurance Results   Total revenues for Domestic Life Insurance increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to considerably lower net realized capital losses. See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Losses and Investments.   Domestic Life Insurance reported operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 of $310 million compared to an operating loss of $5.8 billion in the same period in 2008 due principally to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments. Operating income was adversely affected by lower net investment income due to reduced overall investment yields from increased levels of short-term investments, a current period decline of $40 million in the fair value of the investment in ML II and decreases in premiums and other considerations due to lower payout annuities and the sale of AIG Life Canada.  141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Domestic Life Insurance Sales and Deposits   Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits by product* were as follows:                                           Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2009   2008   2009   2008            Life insurance                                          Periodic premium by product:                                            Universal life    $ 9    $ 42      (79 )%  $ 39    $ 135      (71 )%      Variable universal life      1      5      (80 )    9      38      (76 )      Term life      16      55      (71 )    57      162      (65 )      Whole life/other      1      -      -      2      2      -                Total periodic premiums by product      27      102      (74 )    107      337      (68 )    Unscheduled and single deposits      5      47      (89 )    55      207      (73 )              Total life insurance      32      149      (79 )    162      544      (70 )          Home service                                            Life insurance and accident and health      23      25      (8 )    61      69      (12 )      Fixed annuities      27      54      (50 )    124      123      1        Unscheduled and single deposits      4      7      (43 )    13      17      (24 )              Total home service      54      86      (37 )    198      209      (5 )          Group life/health      10      25      (60 )    55      88      (38 )    Payout annuities      224      774      (71 )    659      1,896      (65 )    Individual fixed and runoff annuities      191      361      (47 )    585      698      (16 )          Total sales and deposits    $ 511    $ 1,395      (63 )%  $ 1,659    $ 3,435      (52 )%             *Excludes divested operations.

Total Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to lower payout annuities and life insurance premiums. Payout annuities sales and life insurance premiums decreased primarily due to lower financial strength ratings and the lingering effects of negative publicity.  142      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Domestic Retirement Services Results  Domestic Retirement Services results, presented on a sub-product basis were as follows:                                   (in millions)   Premiums and Other Considerations   Net Investment Income   Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)   Total Revenues   Operating Income (Loss)            Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                                      Group retirement products   $ 83   $ 550   $ (215 ) $ 418   $ 58        Individual fixed annuities     10     790     (272 )   528     (28 )      Individual variable annuities     119     37     (104 )   52     56        Individual annuities — runoff*     6     60     (30 )   36     (30 )              Total   $ 218   $ 1,437   $ (621 ) $ 1,034   $ 56            Three Months Ended September 30, 2008                                      Group retirement products   $ 102   $ 307   $ (2,533 ) $ (2,124 ) $ (2,487 )      Individual fixed annuities     26     499     (5,209 )   (4,684 )   (5,239 )      Individual variable annuities     150     14     (375 )   (211 )   (830 )      Individual annuities — runoff*     3     78     (378 )   (297 )   (369 )              Total   $ 281   $ 898   $ (8,495 ) $ (7,316 ) $ (8,925 )          Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                      Group retirement products      (19 )%   79 %   - %   - %   - %      Individual fixed annuities     (62 )   58     -     -     -        Individual variable annuities     (21 )   164     -     -     -        Individual annuities — runoff     100     (23 )   -     -     -                Total      (22 )%   60 %   - %   - %   - %          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                                      Group retirement products   $ 237   $ 1,381   $ (866 ) $ 752   $ (374 )      Individual fixed annuities     69     1,995     (1,271 )   793     (967 )      Individual variable annuities     335     98     55     488     (451 )      Individual annuities — runoff*     13     180     (154 )   39     (153 )              Total   $ 654   $ 3,654   $ (2,236 ) $ 2,072   $ (1,945 )          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008                                      Group retirement products   $ 320   $ 1,289   $ (4,213 ) $ (2,604 ) $ (3,679 )      Individual fixed annuities     66     2,075     (8,046 )   (5,905 )   (7,469 )      Individual variable annuities     459     83     (670 )   (128 )   (1,017 )      Individual annuities — runoff*     10     240     (650 )   (400 )   (625 )              Total   $ 855   $ 3,687   $ (13,579 ) $ (9,037 ) $ (12,790 )          Percentage Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year:                                      Group retirement products      (26 )%   7 %   - %   - %   - %      Individual fixed annuities     5     (4 )   -     -     -        Individual variable annuities     (27 )   18     -     -     -        Individual annuities — runoff     30     (25 )   -     -     -                Total      (24 )%    (1 )%   - %   - %   - %             *Primarily represents runoff annuity business sold through discontinued distribution relationships.    Quarterly Domestic Retirement Services Results   Domestic Retirement Services reported operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss in the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses principally due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges, higher partnership income of $652 million, a $141 million increase in the fair value of the investment in ML II and favorable DAC amortization and reserve adjustments  143      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  recorded for individual variable annuities due to positive markets returns in the quarter. In addition, the third quarter of 2008 results included DAC and SIA unlockings and related reserve strengthening of $728 million and impairments of $6.2 billion related to AIG's U.S. securities lending program which was terminated in December 2008.   These increases were partially offset by $376 million lower DAC and SIA benefits relating to net realized capital losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Current period results were also negatively affected by increased levels of low yielding short-term investments, decreases in fee income and lower assets under management. See Consolidated Results — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Losses for further discussion.   Year-to-Date Domestic Retirement Services Results   Domestic Retirement Services reported lower operating losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to considerably lower net realized capital losses arising principally from lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and a $479 million decrease in the fair value of embedded policy derivative liabilities, net of related economic hedges, driven by improved bond and equity market conditions. The results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 included impairments of $9.5 billion related to AIG's U.S. securities lending program which was terminated in December 2008. Income from partnership investments increased to $57 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to losses of $434 million for the same period in 2008. Results also improved due to negative DAC and SIA unlockings and related reserve strengthening being $126 million lower for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The 2009 unlockings primarily were the result of reductions in the long-term growth assumptions for group retirement products and individual variable annuities, deteriorating equity market conditions early in the year and projected increases in surrenders for individual fixed annuities. The 2008 unlockings primarily related to deteriorating equity market conditions for individual variable annuities and projected increases in surrenders for all three product lines.   The improvement in operating income was partially offset by reduced DAC and SIA benefits of $649 million from lower net realized capital losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Current year results were also negatively affected by a $73 million decline in the fair value of the economic interest in ML II, increased levels of low yielding short-term investments, decreases in fee income and lower assets under management.

Deposits in all three product lines have been negatively affected by lower AIG ratings and the lingering effects of negative AIG publicity. For individual variable annuities, the decrease is also attributable to a general decline in industry sales volumes. Individual fixed and variable annuity sales have decreased due to the temporary suspension of product sales at certain selling organizations due to the effect of the AIG events. Deposits for individual fixed annuities and group retirement products increased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, compared to the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 by 41 percent and 7 percent, respectively, primarily due to reinstatement of sales at certain financial institutions and a reduction in publicity regarding AIG events.   Surrender rates and other withdrawals increased for group retirement products and individual variable and fixed annuities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to the AIG ratings downgrades (and related downgrades at the Domestic Retirements Services operating life insurance companies) and negative publicity about AIG. However, surrender rates and net flows have continued to improve in all three product lines from the fourth quarter of 2008. Surrenders and other withdrawals declined for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, compared with the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 for individual fixed annuities and group retirement products by 48 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Surrender rates for group retirement products are expected to increase in the reminder of 2009 as certain large group surrenders are anticipated.

Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment-type products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet with DAC and amortized over the life of the business similar to DAC. AIG offers sales inducements to contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contracts. Sales inducements are recognized as an asset (SIA) with a corresponding increase to the liability for policyholder contract deposits on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the life of the contract similar to DAC. The deferral of acquisition and sales inducement costs decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to declines in new business production.   AIG adopted a new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard on April 1, 2009 resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to the cost basis of affected securities and DAC and SIA charges related to other-than-temporary impairments previously taken. There was no material effect to DAC and SIA assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, because realized capital gains and losses are included in the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC for investment-oriented products, DAC amortization is expected to be lower in future periods.  The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC/VOBA and SIA:                                     Nine Months Ended September 30,   2009   2008      (in millions)   DAC/VOBA   SIA   Total   DAC/VOBA   SIA   Total            Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services                                          Balance at beginning of year    $ 26,166    $ 317    $ 26,483    $ 26,175    $ 681    $ 26,856        Acquisition costs deferred      3,785      23      3,808      4,250      67      4,317        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income      (2,956 )    (17 )    (2,973 )    (2,783 )    (49 )    (2,832 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities(a)      (237 )    —      (237 )    2,216      7      2,223        Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange      975      12      987      (70 )    (11 )    (81 )      Other(b)(c)      (211 )    (4 )    (215 )    (1,088 )    (298 )    (1,386 )          Balance at end of period    $ 27,522    $ 331    $ 27,853    $ 28,700    $ 397    $ 29,097            Domestic Life Insurance                                          Balance at beginning of year    $ 7,236    $ 66    $ 7,302    $ 6,432    $ 53    $ 6,485        Acquisition costs deferred      396      11      407      656      11      667        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income      (510 )    (11 )    (521 )    (400 )    (5 )    (405 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities(a)      (284 )    (1 )    (285 )    415      —      415        Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange      (14 )    —      (14 )    (40 )    —      (40 )      Other(b)      (760 )    (6 )    (766 )    —      —      —            Balance at end of period    $ 6,064    $ 59    $ 6,123    $ 7,063    $ 59    $ 7,122            Domestic Retirement Services                                          Balance at beginning of year    $ 7,211    $ 1,415    $ 8,626    $ 5,838    $ 991    $ 6,829        Acquisition costs deferred      344      116      460      654      163      817        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income      (721 )    (186 )    (907 )    (530 )    (39 )    (569 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities(a)      (547 )    (127 )    (674 )    817      146      963        Increase (decrease) due to foreign exchange      —      —      —      —      —      —        Other(b)      (1,078 )    (262 )    (1,340 )    —      —      —            Balance at end of period    $ 5,209    $ 956    $ 6,165    $ 6,779    $ 1,261    $ 8,040             147      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries                                     Nine Months Ended September 30,   2009   2008      (in millions)   DAC/VOBA   SIA   Total   DAC/VOBA   SIA   Total            Total Life Insurance & Retirement Services                                          Balance at beginning of year    $ 40,613    $ 1,798    $ 42,411    $ 38,445    $ 1,725    $ 40,170        Acquisition costs deferred      4,525      150      4,675      5,560      241      5,801        Amortization (charged) or credited to operating income      (4,187 )    (214 )    (4,401 )    (3,713 )    (93 )    (3,806 )      Change in unrealized gains (losses) on securities(a)      (1,068 )    (128 )    (1,196 )    3,448      153      3,601        Increase due to foreign exchange      961      12      973      (110 )    (11 )    (121 )      Other(b)(c)      (2,049 )    (272 )    (2,321 )    (1,088 )    (298 )    (1,386 )          Balance at end of period    $ 38,795    $ 1,346    $ 40,141    $ 42,542    $ 1,717    $ 44,259               (a)In 2009, includes increases of $191 million, $286 million and $1.3 billion for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services, respectively, related to the cumulative effect of adopting a new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard.

(c) In 2008, primarily represents the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard addressing the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities.    As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC, VOBA and SIA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.   DAC, VOBA and SIA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG's DAC, VOBA and SIA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG's results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.   Financial Services Operations   AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital markets, and consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations.   Aircraft Leasing   AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.   Capital Markets   Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and engaged in borrowing activities that involve issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into GIAs. Given the extreme market conditions experienced in 2008, downgrades of AIG's credit ratings by the rating agencies and AIG's intent to refocus on its core businesses, in late 2008 AIGFP began to unwind its businesses and portfolios, including  148      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities.   Historically, AIG's Capital Markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. AIGFP has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. Revenues and operating income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of AIGFP's assets and liabilities and by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the comparative period.   Consumer Finance   AIG's Consumer Finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives most of its revenues from finance charges assessed on real estate loans, secured and unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables.   AIG's foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. At September 30, 2009, AIGCFG had operations in Argentina, China, Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, India and Colombia.

The operating results in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 also included gains of $645 million and $2.4 billion, respectively, representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including a loss of $85 million and a   149      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   gain of $4 million, respectively, reflected in the unrealized market valuations on the super senior credit default swaps. Interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios in 2009 partially offset the unrealized market valuation gains related to AIGFP's credit default swap portfolios and the gains related to the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities.    •AGF's operating loss decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in finance charge revenues. AGF's operating loss increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower finance charges and other revenues reflecting the sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF's liquidity management efforts and higher provision for finance receivable losses resulting from increases to the allowance for finance receivable losses in response to the higher levels of delinquencies on AGF's finance receivable portfolio and higher net charge-offs. This increase in operating loss was partially offset by lower operating expenses and interest expense. AGF's operating expenses declined in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to the write-down of AGF's goodwill of $341 million during the third quarter of 2008, the decision to cease its wholesale originations in 2008 and the closing of over 400 AGF branch offices in 2008 and 2009 combined.   •For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, Consumer Finance results include net losses on the sale of various international consumer finance operations of $241 million and $446 million, respectively.   •ILFC reported an increase in rental revenues of $86 million and an interest expense decrease of $62 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The rental revenues increase was driven to a large extent by a larger aircraft fleet and the interest expense decrease resulted from lower composite borrowing rates. However, ILFC's operating income decreased due to an out of period charge of $80 million in the third quarter of 2009 related to a credit value adjustment, which had no effect on AIG's consolidated operating income. Operating income increased 12 percent or $112 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 driven to a large extent by a larger aircraft fleet and lower composite borrowing rates.   •For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 the other segment reflects a loss of $287 million on the sale of the U.S. life premium finance business of AIG Credit Corp. and A.I. Credit.    Quarterly Capital Markets Results   AIGFP's operating gain in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss for the same period in 2008 was primarily related to a market valuation gain in 2009 compared to a loss in 2008 on its super senior credit default swap portfolio. AIGFP's results also reflect the effects of its wind-down activities.   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $959 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $7.1 billion in 2008, representing the change in fair value of its super senior credit default swap portfolio. The principal components of the valuation gains and losses recognized were as follows:    •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $332 million in the third quarter of 2009 with respect to credit default swaps (CDS) transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to a $6.3 billion unrealized market valuation loss for the same period in 2008. The change from an unrealized market valuation loss to an unrealized market valuation gain on this portfolio was largely due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of CDS contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 in connection with the ML III transaction as well as improvement in market conditions in the third quarter of 2009.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $566 million in the third quarter of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to a $538 million market valuation loss for the same period in 2008. During the third quarter of 2009, the valuation of these contracts benefited from the narrowing of corporate credit spreads, while these spreads widened during the same period in 2008.   150                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.   During the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, AIGFP recognized a gain of $370 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio, compared to a net loss of $248 million in the same period of 2008.   The following table presents AIGFP's credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) (excluding intercompany transactions):                           (in millions)                         Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities                  Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                      Bond trading securities   $ 1,627    Notes and bonds payable   $ (281 )      Loans and other assets     19    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     (252 )    Derivative assets     (6 )  GIAs     (105 )                 Other liabilities     (45 )              Derivative liabilities*     (312 )                Increase in assets   $ 1,640    Increase in liabilities   $ (995 )              Net pre-tax increase to other income   $ 645                        Three Months Ended September 30, 2008                      Bond trading securities   $ (2,032 )  Notes and bonds payable   $ 1,003        Loans and other assets     (7 )  Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     729      Derivative assets     (240 )  GIAs     (1,272 )                 Other liabilities     81                Derivative liabilities*     751                  Decrease in assets   $ (2,279 )  Decrease in liabilities   $ 1,292                Net pre-tax decrease to other income   $ (987 )                       *Includes super senior credit default swap portfolio.    AIGFP's operating gain in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a net gain of $645 million representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $85 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The gain in the third quarter of 2009 was primarily the result of the narrowing in credit spreads since June 30, 2009. This gain was partially offset by losses from the narrowing of AIG's credit spreads.   The operating loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2008 included a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $987 million, and reflected $98 million of gains included in unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. Credit valuation adjustment losses of $2.3 billion on AIGFP assets were primarily due to the widening of credit spreads on CDOs and ABS products, which represented a significant portion of AIGFP's investment portfolio. Credit spreads on the ABS and CDO investments widened significantly more than the widening in AIG's credit spreads. Furthermore, while AIG's credit spreads widened during the third quarter of 2008, the credit valuation adjustment on its liabilities decreased due to a decline in AIGFP's outstanding debt obligations and the shortened maturity of its liabilities.   Included in AIGFP's financial results for the third quarter of 2009 is $569 million of interest charges on intercompany borrowings with AIG that is eliminated in consolidation.   Historically, the most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses was compensation. Due to the significant losses recognized by AIGFP during 2008, the entire amount of $563 million accrued under AIGFP's  151      Table of Contents  various deferred compensation plans and special incentive plan was reversed in the third quarter of 2008. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, compensation expense was approximately $25 million, or only 17 percent of operating expenses. In addition, AIGFP recognized $34 million in expenses related to pre-existing retention plans that were reported as part of restructuring expenses.   Year-to-Date Capital Markets Results   AIGFP's operating gain in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss for the same period in 2008 was primarily related to a market valuation gain in 2009 compared to a loss in 2008 on its super senior credit default swap portfolio. AIGFP's results also reflect the effects of its wind-down activities.   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.1 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $21.7 billion in 2008, representing the change in fair value of its super senior credit default swap portfolio. The principal components of the valuation gains and losses recognized were as follows:   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $761 million in the first nine months of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to $19.9 billion for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the unrealized market valuation loss on this portfolio was largely due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of CDS contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 in connection with the ML III transaction.   •AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $1.3 billion for the same period in 2008. During the first nine months of 2009, the valuation of these contracts benefited from the narrowing of corporate credit spreads, while these spreads widened during the same period in 2008.   See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio.   During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, AIGFP recognized a gain of $251 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio, compared to a net loss of $331 million in the same period of 2008.   During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, AIGFP incurred an additional charge of $198 million related to a transaction entered into in 2002 whereby AIGFP guaranteed obligations under leases of office space from a counterparty.  152      Table of Contents  The following table presents AIGFP's credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) (excluding intercompany transactions):                           (in millions)                         Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities                  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                      Bond trading securities   $ 1,365    Notes and bonds payable   $ (34 )      Loans and other assets     (43 )  Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     59      Derivative assets     796    GIAs     214                   Other liabilities     12                Derivative liabilities*     26                  Increase in assets   $ 2,118    Decrease in liabilities   $ 277                Net pre-tax increase to other income   $ 2,395                        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008                      Bond trading securities   $ (4,683 )  Notes and bonds payable   $ 1,185        Loans and other assets     (35 )  Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     1,344      Derivative assets     (543 )  GIAs     (200 )                 Other liabilities     109                Derivative liabilities*     1,390                  Decrease in assets   $ (5,261 )  Decrease in liabilities   $ 3,828                Net pre-tax decrease to other income   $ (1,433 )                       *Includes super senior credit default swap portfolio.    AIGFP's operating gain in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a net gain of $2.4 billion representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $4 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The gain in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 was primarily the result of tightening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant segment of AIGFP's investment portfolio.   For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 AIGFP's operating loss included a credit valuation adjustment loss of $1.4 billion representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP's assets and liabilities, including $207 million of credit valuation adjustment gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. Included in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 net operating loss is the transition amount of $291 million related to the adoption of new accounting standards for measuring fair value and electing to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, as well as a credit valuation adjustment gain of $193 million for derivatives AIGFP entered into with other AIG entities, which is eliminated in consolidation.   Included in AIGFP's financial results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 is $2.2 billion of interest charges on intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation.   Historically, the most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses was compensation. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, compensation expense was approximately $75 million, or only 18 percent of operating expenses. In addition, AIGFP recognized $121 million in expenses related to pre-existing retention plans that were reported as part of restructuring expenses. Year to date results for 2008 also reflect the reversal of amounts accrued under AIGFP's various deferred compensation plans in the third quarter of 2008 as discussed above.  153                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   Asset Management Operations   AIG's Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products. These services and products are offered to individuals, pension funds and institutions (including AIG subsidiaries) globally through AIG's Spread-Based Investment business, Institutional Asset Management, and Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds businesses. Also included in Asset Management operations are the results of certain SunAmerica sponsored partnership investments.   The revenues and operating income (loss) for this segment are affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets. In addition, net realized gains and carried interest are contingent upon investment maturity levels and market conditions. In the Institutional Asset Management business, carried interest, computed in accordance with each fund's governing agreement, is based on the investment's performance over the life of each fund. Unrealized carried interest is recognized based on each fund's performance as of the balance sheet date. Future fund performance may negatively affect previously recognized carried interest.   On September 5, 2009, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its investment advisory and third party Institutional Asset Management businesses. This sale will exclude those asset management businesses providing traditional fixed income and shorter duration asset and liability management for AIG's insurance company subsidiaries and AIG's Global Real Estate investment management business as well as proprietary real estate and private equity investments. AIG will retain its real estate asset management business. AIG expects to continue short-term relationships with the divested businesses for other investment management services used by its insurance company subsidiaries.   See the 2008 Form 10-K for a further description of the Asset Management businesses.

Substantially all of the operating unit's goodwill was impaired in the third quarter. The third quarter assessment of the segment was negatively affected by a significant decline in certain consolidated warehoused investments as well as the consideration of recent transaction activity. A total of $697 million in goodwill impairments was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2009, with $287 million offset in non-controlling interest, which is not part of operating income (loss).  154      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Restructuring-related expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 for the Asset Management segment were $9 million and $34 million, respectively.   Quarterly Spread-Based Investment Business Results   The Spread-Based Investment business reported a lower operating loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments due primarily to the improved credit environment and the adoption of the new accounting standard on other-than-temporary impairments offset by increased net fair value losses on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment.   AIG enters into derivative arrangements to hedge the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs. Some of these hedging relationships do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore create volatility in operating results despite being effective economic hedges.   Year-to-Date Spread-Based Investment Business Results   The Spread-Based Investment business reported a lower operating loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments due primarily to the improved credit environment and the adoption of the new accounting standard on other-than-temporary impairments offset by increased net fair value losses on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment.  The GIC program is in runoff with no new GICs issued subsequent to 2005. The anticipated runoff of the domestic GIC portfolio was as follows:                                 At September 30, 2009 (in billions)   Remainder of 2009   2010 - 2012   2013 - 2014   Thereafter   Total            Domestic GICs    $ 1.4   $ 2.7   $ 2.4   $ 3.6   $ 10.1              Contractual maturities of debt issued under the MIP was as follows:                                  At September 30, 2009 (in billions)   Remainder of 2009   2010 - 2012   2013 - 2014   Thereafter   Total            MIP liabilities    $ -   $ 7.7   $ 1.3   $ 4.6   $ 13.6              The GIC and MIP both invest in various fixed income asset classes which include corporate debt, both public and private, and structured fixed income products consisting of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and CDOs. The majority of these investments are currently rated investment grade. In addition, the GIC and the MIP invest in bank loans, commercial mortgage loans and single name credit default swaps. The GIC invests in limited partnership (or equivalent) interests in private equity and hedge funds, while the MIP does not.   Quarterly Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management recognized an operating loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to operating income in the same period in 2008, primarily resulting from goodwill impairments and impairments on proprietary real estate and private equity investments. Also contributing to the decline were lower base management fees. Goodwill impairments totalling $625 million were recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2009, with $287 million offset in non-controlling interest, which is not part of operating income (loss).   Real estate impairments of $506 million during the third quarter of 2009 were incurred in the direct investment portfolio as well as through real estate joint ventures as the global credit crisis has continued to put pressure on real  155      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  estate values, occupancy rates and leasing activity. Approximately $67 million was included in non-controlling interest, which is not part of operating income (loss). This downward pressure has caused impairments across the portfolio. In addition, the availability of refinancing and required capital has caused management to reduce the estimated time period before sale for certain investments resulting in impairments.   Impairments of private equity investments originally acquired for warehouse purposes were driven by asset specific valuation considerations which were deemed to be other-than-temporary.   Base management fees have declined from prior year periods due to lower average assets under management. The lower average asset base is a function of reduced asset values and client loss, which primarily occurred in the second half of 2008 and has since abated.   Year-to-Date Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management recognized an increased operating loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily from the impairments discussed above. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, unrealized carried interest revenues have declined as compared to the prior year period due to a decline in portfolio asset valuations as well as lower management fees on lower base assets under management. Unrealized carried interest revenues are impacted by asset valuation changes within the managed portfolio and typically move in tandem with the level of assets under management and related base management fees. The operating loss was partially offset by a $111 million gain on the sale of AIG Private Bank.   Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds   Revenues and operating income related to Brokerage Services and Mutual Fund activities decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 due to a goodwill impairments of approximately $72 million and $81 million in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, respectively.   Other Asset Management Results   Revenues and operating income related to Other Asset Management activities increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 from the same period in 2008, due to higher partnership income as the third quarter of 2009 showed signs of improvement. Revenues and operating income related to Other Asset Management activities decreased marginally in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 from the same period in 2008, due to lower partnership income driven by weaker market conditions in 2009.   Other Operations   AIG's Other operations include interest expense, restructuring costs, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments, expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls, corporate initiatives and certain compensation plan expenses.   Additionally, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, in order to better align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers manage their businesses, the results for Mortgage Guaranty, Transatlantic, Personal Lines (excluding Private Client Group) and HSB are now included in AIG's Other operations. These amounts were previously reported as part of General Insurance operations. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation.  156      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Other Results   The operating income of AIG's Other category was as follows:                                           Three Months Ended September 30,         Nine Months Ended September 30,              Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)   Percentage Increase/ (Decrease)     (in millions)   2009   2008   2009   2008            Parent company:                                            Income from equity method investments, net of dividends or distributions   $ (2 ) $ (13 )   - % $ (34 ) $ 3     - %      Interest income     614     167     268     2,338     257     -        Interest expense on Federal Reserve Bank of New York credit facility     (1,252 )   (802 )   -     (4,156 )   (802 )   -        Other interest expense     (556 )   (571 )   -     (1,649 )   (1,391 )   -        Unallocated corporate expenses     (128 )   (321 )   -     (547 )   (786 )   -        Restructuring expenses     (95 )   -     -     (343 )   -     -        Change in fair value of ML III*     -     -     -     (1,401 )   -     -        Net realized capital gains (losses)     (597 )   139     -     11     (96 )   -        Other miscellaneous, net     139     (15 )   -     393     (84 )   -            Total Parent company   $ (1,877 ) $ (1,416 )   - % $ (5,388 ) $ (2,899 )   - %          Noncore businesses:                                            Mortgage Guaranty   $ (465 ) $ (1,118 )   - % $ (1,433 ) $ (1,990 )   - %      Change in fair value of ML III*     1,162     -     -     1,624     -     -        Other     (158 )   (178 )   -     62     131     (53 )          Total noncore businesses   $ 539   $ (1,296 )   - % $ 253   $ (1,859 )   - %          Total Other operations   $ (1,338 ) $ (2,712 )   - % $ (5,135 ) $ (4,758 )   - %             *Parent company contributed its equity interest in ML III to an AIG subsidiary, reported above in Noncore businesses, during the second quarter of 2009.   Parent Company   Parent company operating loss in the three months ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to interest expense on the FRBNY Facility, net realized capital losses primarily arising from asset dispositions, and restructuring expenses. These were partially offset by interest income on intercompany loans, which are eliminated in consolidation, and lower unallocated corporate expenses related to share-based compensation and corporate operating expenses.   Parent company operating loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to interest expense on the FRBNY Facility, losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG's equity interest in ML III, and restructuring expenses. These were partially offset by interest income on intercompany loans.   Noncore businesses   Mortgage Guaranty   The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, that covers the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to four-family residences.   During 2008, UGC tightened underwriting guidelines and increased premium rates for its first-lien business, ceased insuring second-lien business as of September 30, 2008 and during the fourth quarter of 2008 ceased insuring new private student loan business and suspended insuring new business throughout its European operations. All of these  157      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  actions were in response to the worsening conditions in the global housing markets and resulted in a significant decline in new business written during the second half of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009.   Mortgage Guaranty, in common with other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties.   UGC's domestic mortgage risk in force totaled $29.3 billion as of September 30, 2009 and the 60+ — day delinquency ratio was 11.8 percent (based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice) compared to domestic mortgage risk in force of $31.0 billion and a delinquency ratio of 6.0 percent at September 30, 2008. Approximately 85 percent of the domestic mortgage risk is secured by first-lien, owner-occupied properties.   The second-lien risk in force at September 30, 2009 totaled $2.7 billion compared to $3.2 billion of risk in force at September 30, 2008. Risk in force represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions. UGC's loss projections include expected losses of $232 million related to reinstatement layers with approximately $1.2 billion of risk in force exposure for pools that have already or are expected to reach the stop loss.   Mortgage Guaranty operating loss decreased for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to lower loss and loss adjustment expenses in domestic first- and second-liens business. The domestic first-lien operating loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 decreased $101 million from the same period in 2008 to $237 million while the second-lien three month September 30, 2009 operating loss of $105 million decreased $650 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decline in first-lien operating loss reflects the recognition of a $38 million benefit due to stop loss limits on certain first-lien pool business. The decline in the second-lien operating loss is due primarily to the recognition of a $453 million premium deficiency reserve during the three-month period ended September 30, 2008. These results were partially offset by the increased operating loss in international for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 of $105 million which is $84 million higher than the same period in 2008.   Mortgage Guaranty operating loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 decreased compared to the same period in 2008. The decreased operating loss reflects a $675 million reduction in operating expenses reflecting the recognition of a premium deficiency reserve of $453 million in 2008 and the release of $222 million premium deficiency reserve in the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by increased loss and loss adjustment expenses in 2009. Domestic second-lien business reported an operating loss of $308 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 which was $908 million lower than the same period in 2008 reflecting the release of the premium deficiency reserve in the first quarter of 2009. Domestic first-lien and international business operating losses of $880 million and $199 million, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 were $126 million and $166 million higher, respectively, during the same period in 2008.   Change in fair value of ML III   Gains in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 resulted from improvements in projected cash flows and narrowing of credit spreads.   Other noncore businesses consist of the following:   Transatlantic   Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis both in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk.   On June 10, 2009, AIG closed the previously announced public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock owned directly and indirectly by AIG for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. At the close of the public offering, AIG indirectly retained 13.9 percent of the Transatlantic common stock issued and outstanding. As a result, AIG deconsolidated Transatlantic, which resulted in a $1.4 billion reduction in Noncontrolling interest, a component of Total equity. Operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a loss of $497 million related to the deconsolidation of Transatlantic.  158                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   21st Century   On July 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of 21st Century Insurance Group and the Agency Auto Division (excluding AIG Private Client Group). Operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a loss of $407 million related to the sale of 21st Century.   HSB   On March 31, 2009, AIG closed the sale of HSB, the parent company of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, to Munich Re Group. Operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 includes a gain of $163 million related to the sale of HSB.   Critical Accounting Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers that its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of   •AIG's ability to continue as a going concern,   •liability for general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses,   •future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts,   •recoverability of DAC,   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products,   •the allowance for finance receivable losses,   •flight equipment recoverability,   •other-than-temporary impairments,   •goodwill impairment,   •liability for legal contingencies,   •estimates with respect to income taxes, and   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps and AIG's investments in ML II and ML III (Maiden Lane Interests).   These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected.   The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below.  AIG's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   When assessing AIG's ability to continue as a going concern, management must make judgments and estimates about the following:    •the marketability of assets to be disposed of and the timing and amount of related cash proceeds to be used to repay indebtedness;   •the planned sales of significant subsidiaries;   •plans to raise new funds or refinance debt;   •projections of future profitability and the timing and amount of cash flows from operating activities;   •the funding needs of regulated subsidiaries;   159      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   •AIG's ability to comply with debt covenants;   •plans to reduce expenditures;   •the effects of ratings agency actions on collateral requirements and other contractual conditions; and   •the future regulatory, business, credit, and competitive environments in which AIG operates around the world.    These factors, individually and collectively, will have a significant effect on AIG's ability to generate sufficient cash to repay indebtedness as it becomes due and profitably operate its businesses as it executes its restructuring initiatives.  Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses (General Insurance):    •Loss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years.   •Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2009 for the year-end 2009 loss reserve analysis. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years.   •Loss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount.   •Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses: the expected recoveries from reinsurers on losses that have not yet been reported and/or settled.    For discussion of sensitivity analysis on the reserve for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, see Results of Operations — Segment Results — General Insurance Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense in the 2008 Form 10-K.  Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):    •Interest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products.   •Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form, risk classification and distribution channel.    Periodically, the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) established for Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies are tested to ensure that, including consideration of future expected premium payments, they are adequate to provide for future policyholder benefit obligations. The assumptions used to perform the tests are current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, morbidity, terminations, company maintenance expenses and invested asset returns. For long duration traditional business, a "lock-in" principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. For business in force outside of North America, 52 percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at September 30, 2009 resulted from traditional business where the lock-in principle applies. In most foreign locations, various guarantees are embedded in policies in force that may remain applicable for many decades into the future.   As experience changes over time, the best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes. Because of the long-term nature of many of AIG's liabilities subject to the lock-in principle, small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy.  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):    •Recoverability: based on current and future expected profitability, which is affected by interest rates, foreign exchange rates, mortality/morbidity experience, expenses, investment returns and policy persistency.   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General Insurance):    •Recoverability: based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.   160      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries     Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):    •Estimated gross profits: to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (investment-oriented products), which affect the carrying value of DAC, unearned revenue liability, SIAs and associated amortization patterns. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality and other expenses.   Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses (Financial Services):    •Historical defaults and delinquency experience: utilizing factors, such as delinquency ratio, allowance ratio, charge-off ratio and charge-off coverage.   •Portfolio characteristics: portfolio composition and consideration of the recent changes to underwriting criteria and portfolio seasoning.   •External factors: consideration of current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.   •Migration analysis: empirical technique measuring historical movement of similar finance receivables through various levels of repayment, delinquency, and loss categories to existing finance receivable pools.   Flight Equipment Recoverability (Financial Services):    •Expected undiscounted future net cash flows: based upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and lease periods and estimated terminal values of each aircraft based on expectations of market participants.   Other-Than-Temporary Impairments:   At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses. Prior to April 1, 2009, these reviews were conducted pursuant to accounting standards that were amended on April 1, 2009. See AIG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 for a discussion of AIG's process for evaluating other-than-temporary impairments under these prior accounting standards.   In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard addressing recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, which amended the other-than-temporary impairment model for fixed maturity securities and requires additional disclosures. The impairment model for equity securities was not affected. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard.   In connection with AIG's adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard on April 1, 2009, AIG changed its process for determining other-than-temporary impairments with respect to available for sale fixed maturity securities. If AIG intends to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings.   For all other fixed maturity securities for which a credit impairment has occurred, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to earnings. Additional fair value decline below recovery value, if any, is charged to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity investments on which other-than-temporary credit impairments were taken (a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) because this is considered a non-credit impairment.   When assessing AIG's intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or if it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition AIG's investment portfolio, sale of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing.   See the discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by security type, which AIG uses to determine the amount of a credit loss.  161      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  AIG continues to evaluate its available for sale equity securities, equity method and cost method investments for impairment such that a security is considered a candidate for other-than-temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:    •Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to cost for an extended period of time (nine consecutive months or longer);   •The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or   •AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.    The determination that an equity security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. The above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline for which AIG could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary (severity losses).   For further discussion, see Note 5 Investments — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security.  Goodwill Impairment:   Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. AIG performed goodwill impairment testing at September 30, 2009.   The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.   Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG's reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit's fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit's peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. As part of the impairment test, management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all AIG's reporting units with AIG's fully diluted common stock market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values.   If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess.   Management observed a narrowing of the fair values over the carrying values of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Japan and Other and the Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Asia reporting units during the first nine months of 2009. AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other  162      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  events or circumstances that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on goodwill impairments.  Liability for Legal Contingencies   AIG estimates and records a liability for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings related to AIG's activities as a global diversified financial services institution, to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many such proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, AIG often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters.  Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets:   At September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, AIG recorded net deferred tax asset after valuation allowances of $6.8 billion and $11 billion, respectively. A valuation allowance is established if necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of AIG's net deferred tax asset depends on AIG's ability to consummate the proposed AIA and ALICO transactions and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred. Estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG's consolidated financial condition or its results of operations. Because the realization of the deferred tax asset relies on the completion of the proposed transactions and a projection of future taxable income, AIG views this as a critical accounting estimate.   AIG is also relying to a lesser extent upon producing taxable operating profits from the businesses to be retained, principally Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance. AIG has evaluated its forecasts of future operating income and determined that there will be sufficient operating income, inclusive of gains on the divestiture of businesses to realize the recorded net deferred tax asset.   When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at September 30, 2009, AIG considered all available evidence, including (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed through October 30, 2009 and additional actions expected to be completed during the remainder of 2009, (iii) the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (iv) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving greater weight to discrete sources and to earlier future years in the forecast period, and (v) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate taxable amounts.   In assessing future GAAP taxable income, AIG considered its strong earnings history exclusive of the recent losses on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and from the securities lending program. AIG also considered the completed transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury, including (i) the execution of the ALICO and AIA purchase agreements, (ii) reduction of the interest rate payable on outstanding borrowing and undrawn amounts under the FRBNY Facility; (iii) the transfer of RMBS related to AIG's U.S. securities lending program to ML II; (iv) the termination of substantially all multi-sector credit default swap transactions and sale of underlying CDO securities to ML III; (v) the issuance of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for the AIG Series D Preferred Stock; and (vi) the issuance of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock and the establishment of the Department of the Treasury Commitment.   AIG's profitability in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic conditions, catastrophes and other events around the world and, currently, AIG-specific events. Further, the results of operations in the first nine months of 2009 may not be indicative of the results expected for the full year because certain transactions proposed to be entered into with the Department of the Treasury and the FRBNY are not expected to be in place. However, AIG believes its forecasts are achievable.  163                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries   There are many important factors that could significantly affect the attainment of AIG's forecasted results. For a discussion of some of these factors, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in AIG's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009 and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Form 10-K.  U.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries:   Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes incurred on potential dispositions, as well as AIG's reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.  Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:   Overview   AIG measures at fair value on a recurring basis financial instruments in its trading and available for sale securities portfolios, certain mortgage and other loans receivable, certain spot commodities, derivative assets and liabilities, securities purchased/sold under agreements to resell/repurchase, securities lending invested collateral, non-traded equity investments and certain private limited partnerships and certain hedge funds included in other invested assets, certain short-term investments, separate and variable account assets, certain policyholder contract deposits, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors, certain CPFF and other commercial paper, certain long-term debt, and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing, able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date.   The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other-than-active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. An other-than-active market is one in which there are few transactions, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions.   AIG management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. With respect to securities, AIG employs independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments. When AIG's valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models.   Valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads,  164      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  currency rates, and other market-observable information, as applicable. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other security or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.   AIG employs specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of AIG's financial assets and financial liabilities. AIG's processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate, consistently applied, and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. AIG assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques. In addition, AIG may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from AIG's valuation service providers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. AIG also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.  The fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination was as follows:                        At September 30, 2009 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total              Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 407      93%      Fair value based on internal sources     30      7               Total fixed income and equity securities(b)   $ 437      100%               (a)Includes $28.1 billion whose primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale, trading and securities lending invested collateral securities.   See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.   Level 3 Assets and Liabilities   Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about fair value measurements.   At September 30, 2009, AIG classified $39.8 billion and $18.5 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.7 percent and 2.4 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2009. At December 31, 2008, AIG classified $42.1 billion and $21.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.9 percent and 2.6 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  165      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities   AIG values its assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3.   Private equity and real estate fund investments: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price, i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset. Subsequently, they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. AIG considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement.   Corporate bonds and private placement debt: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued using market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads), comparisons to benchmark derivative indices or movements in underlying credit spreads. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name credit default swap spreads and estimated recovery rates.   Certain RMBS and CMBS: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles, remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations, discounted cash flow techniques, and/or for RMBS option adjusted spread analyses.   Certain Asset-Backed Securities — non-mortgage: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued based on external price/spread data. When position-specific external price data are not observable, the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities.   CDOs: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued based on external price/spread data from independent third parties, dealer quotations, matrix pricing, the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model or a combination thereof.   Interests in the Maiden Lane Interests: At their inception, ML II and ML III were valued at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. Subsequently, Maiden Lane Interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the Maiden Lane Interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool. The implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with AIG's interests in the capital structure of the respective entities. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.   The fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the Maiden Lane Interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of the Maiden Lane Interests. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.   As of September 30, 2009, AIG expected to receive cash flows (undiscounted) in excess of AIG's initial investment, and any accrued interest, in the Maiden Lane interests over the remaining life of the investments after repayment of the first priority obligations owed to the FRBNY. AIG's cash flow methodology considers the capital structure of the collateral securities and their expected credit losses from the underlying assets pools.   See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a sensitivity analysis and further discussion on the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests.   AIGFP's Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime  166      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  The net notional amount, fair value of derivative liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class were as follows:                                                               Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss)                  Fair Value of Derivative Liability at          Net Notional Amount    Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          September 30, 2009(a)(b)   December 31, 2008(a)   September 30, 2009(b)(c)   December 31, 2008(c)     (in millions)   2009(d)   2008(d)   2009(d)   2008(d)              Regulatory Capital:                                                        Corporate loans    $ 71,749    $ 125,628    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -          Prime residential mortgages      98,002      107,246      -      -      -      -      -      -        Other(e)      1,953      1,575      31      379      16      (272 )    25      (397 )              Total      171,704      234,449      31      379      16      (272 )    25      (397 )          Arbitrage:                                                          Multi-sector CDOs(f)(g)      8,174      12,556      4,510      5,906      332      (6,262 )    (761 )    (19,868 )      Corporate debt/CLOs(h)      22,577      50,495      456      2,554      566      (538 )    1,716      (1,308 )              Total      30,751      63,051      4,966      8,460      898      (6,800 )    955      (21,176 )          Mezzanine tranches(i)      3,504      4,701      32      195      45      18      163      (153 )            Total    $ 205,959    $ 302,201    $ 5,029    $ 9,034    $ 959    $ (7,054 )  $ 1,143    $ (21,726 )             (a)Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches. (b)During the third quarter of 2009, AIGFP terminated certain super senior CDS transactions with its counterparties with a net notional amount of $2.6 billion, comprised of $247 million in Multi-sector CDO and $2.4 billion in Corporate debt/CLOs. These transactions were terminated at approximately their fair value at the time of the termination. As a result, a $277 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. AIGFP also extinguished its obligation with respect to a Multi-sector CDO by purchasing the protected CDO security for $496 million, its principal amount outstanding related to this obligation. Upon purchase, the CDO security was included in the available for sale portfolio at fair value. (c)Fair value amounts are shown before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral. (d)Includes credit valuation adjustment loss of $85 million and gain of $98 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and credit valuation adjustment gains of $4 million and $207 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing the effect of changes in AIG's credit spreads on the valuation of the derivatives liabilities. (e)During the first nine months of 2009, AIGFP reclassified one regulatory capital CDS transaction from Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans to Regulatory Capital — Other, given the higher likelihood that it will not be terminated when the regulatory capital benefit expires for the counterparty. (f)Includes $6.4 billion and $9.7 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. (g)During the fourth quarter of 2008, AIGFP terminated the majority of the CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs in connection with the ML III transaction. (h)Includes $1.5 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs as of both September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. (i)Net of offsetting purchased CDS of $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion in net notional amount at September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.  167                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  The changes in the net notional amount of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions were as follows:                                  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009  (in millions)   Net Notional Amount December 31, 2008   Terminations and Maturities(a)   Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates(b)   Amortization/ Reclassification, net of Replenishments(c)(d)   Net Notional Amount September 30, 2009            Regulatory Capital:                                      Corporate loans   $ 125,628   $ (41,707 ) $ 2,836   $ (15,008 ) $ 71,749        Prime residential mortgages     107,246     (11,728 )   4,562     (2,078 )   98,002        Other     1,575     (1,464 )   101     1,741     1,953              Total     234,449     (54,899 )   7,499     (15,345 )   171,704            Arbitrage:                                      Multi-sector CDOs     12,556     (3,537 )   153     (998 )   8,174        Corporate debt/CLOs     50,495     (28,075 )   256     (99 )   22,577              Total     63,051     (31,612 )   409     (1,097 )   30,751            Mezzanine tranches     4,701     (703 )   208     (702 )   3,504            Total   $ 302,201   $ (87,214 ) $ 8,116   $  (17,144 ) $ 205,959               (a)During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, AIGFP terminated certain CDS transactions with its counterparties in net notional amount of $62.5 billion, comprised of $35.7 billion in Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans, $11.7 billion in Regulatory Capital — Prime residential mortgages, $1.5 billion in Regulatory Capital — Other, $3.5 billion in Multi-sector CDOs, $9.5 billion in Corporate debt/CLOs and $653 million in Mezzanine tranches. (b)Relates to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, primarily against the Euro and the British Pound. (c)During the first nine months of 2009, AIGFP reclassified one regulatory capital CDS transaction from Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans to Regulatory Capital — other. (d)During the second quarter of 2009, AIGFP reclassified two mezzanine trades having net notional amounts of $462 million and $240 million, respectively, into Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans and Regulatory Capital — Other, respectively, after determining that the trades were not stand-alone but rather part of the related regulatory capital trades. The effect on unrealized market valuation gain (loss) was not significant.

Through October 30, 2009, AIGFP had also received a formal termination notice with respect to an additional $9.5 billion in net notional amount with an effective termination date in 2009. AIG expects that the counterparties in the remaining regulatory capital CDS transactions will terminate the majority of these transactions with AIGFP within the next six months during the transition period of the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I) that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by Basel II. It is expected that financial institution counterparties will have transitioned from Basel I to Basel II by the end of the two-year adoption period on December 31, 2009, after which they will receive little or no additional regulatory benefit from these CDS transactions, except in a small number of specific instances. However, the Basel Committee recently announced that it has agreed to keep in place the Basel I capital floors beyond the end of 2009, although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various European Central Banking districts. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   During the first nine months of 2009, AIGFP reclassified one regulatory capital CDS transaction from Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans to Regulatory Capital — Other given the higher likelihood that it will not be terminated when the regulatory capital benefit expires for the counterparty. AIG does not believe that at this time the CDS provides significant risk transfer benefit to the counterparty; however, AIGFP will continue to monitor this transaction closely.   During April 2009, AIGFP effected the early termination of a CDS transaction written on a European RMBS security of $1.5 billion in net notional amount that was reported as part of Regulatory Capital — Other at March 31, 2009 at a level approximating its fair value at that time. Given its unique structure and concentrated exposure to high loan-to-value Spanish residential mortgages, this transaction had exposed AIGFP to a relatively higher level of liquidity and credit risk than any other regulatory capital CDS exposure, and AIG felt it prudent to terminate the transaction to avoid further deterioration.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 other than for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.  169      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries The following table presents, for each of the regulatory capital CDS transactions in the corporate loan portfolio, the gross transaction notional amount at September 30, 2009, net notional amount at September 30, 2009, attachment point at inception and at September 30, 2009, inception to date realized losses through September 30, 2009 and percent non-investment grade at September 30, 2009:                                    (dollars in millions)    CDS   Gross Transaction Notional Amount at September 30, 2009   Net Notional Amount at September 30, 2009   Attachment Point at Inception(a)   Attachment Point at September 30, 2009(a)   Realized Losses through September 30, 2009(b)   Percent Non-investment Grade at September 30, 2009(c)            1   $ 832   $ 727     10.03 %   12.58 %   0.52 %   19.71%      2     14,630     8,193     44.00 %   44.00 %   0.00 %   1.06%      3     2,419     2,159     10.00 %   10.75 %   0.15 %   55.64%      4(d)      9,585     8,143     15.02 %   15.04 %   0.00 %   18.60%      5     8,772     7,790     11.00 %   11.19 %   0.00 %   11.06%      6     549     286     18.00 %   47.92 %   0.00 %   64.50%      7     11,223     9,958     10.80 %   11.27 %   0.00 %   5.91%      8     8,275     6,758     11.30 %   18.33 %   0.16 %   23.09%      9     5,543     4,904     11.00 %   11.52 %   0.09 %   11.99%      10     4,849     4,177     13.26 %   13.86 %   0.00 %   72.65%      11     10,241     3,138     12.00 %   12.00 %   0.00 %   5.47%      12     2,419     2,023     15.85 %   16.38 %   0.00 %   9.75%      13     4,069     3,265     14.50 %   19.75 %   0.00 %   74.75%      14     1,615     1,195     14.00 %   25.98 %   0.00 %   34.07%      15     1,042     772     14.00 %   25.98 %   0.00 %   34.07%      16     2,237     1,656     14.00 %   25.98 %   0.00 %   34.07%      17     9,085     6,605     17.00 %   27.30 %   0.05 %   15.56%                Total   $ 97,385   $ 71,749                                                               (a)Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

(c)Terminated effective October 28, 2009. (d)Delinquency information is not provided to AIGFP for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of these transactions. However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to AIGFP for such referenced pools.   All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report  171      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In virtually all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for a significant majority of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIG receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower, notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. For example, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values, and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. The four pools containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 35.00 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The average number of loans in each pool is over 5,000. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. Three of the four transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at September 30, 2009 and the fourth was rated A-. Three other pools, with a total net notional amount of $3.6 billion, have non-investment grade percentages greater than 25 percent, each with a remaining life to maturity of 16.5 years. These pools have no realized losses from inception through September 30, 2009 and have current attachment points of 25.98 percent. Approximately 0.26 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 0.00 percent to 1.80 percent.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.   Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on approximately 76 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.08 percent to 3.59 percent, averaging 0.78 percent. For all but three transactions, which comprised less than 1.50 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.31 percent and ranged from 0.00 percent to 2.28 percent. The default rate  172      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  on the remaining three transactions ranged from 4.47 percent to 14.51 percent. The subordination on these three transactions ranged from 32.03 percent to 41.58 percent.   Where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses, and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers, and information available from rating agencies, governments, and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans with similar characteristics that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.

In certain cases, simultaneously with the exercise of the 2a-7 Puts by AIGFP's counterparties, AIGFP accessed financing arrangements previously entered into with such counterparties, pursuant to which the counterparties remained the legal owners of the underlying CDO securities. However, these securities were reported as part of AIGFP's investment portfolio as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Most of these underlying CDO securities were later acquired by ML III from AIGFP's counterparties. In a separate case, AIGFP extinguished its obligations with respect to one CDS by purchasing the protected CDO security. (b)The CDS in respect of the ML III transaction were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 based on the fair value of the underlying multi-sector CDOs at October 31, 2008, as mutually agreed between the FRBNY and AIG.

In a number of instances, the level of subordination with respect to individual CDOs has increased since inception relative to the overall size of the CDO. While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.   Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of September 30, 2009, 73.2 percent of AIGFP's regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to a Credit Support Annex (CSA) and 26.8 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone Master Agreement or similar agreement, under which the aggregate Exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty, and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans, or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.  Market Value of Reference Obligation—Under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the difference between the net notional amount of a referenced RMBS security and the security's market value.  Expected Loss Models—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.  Negotiated Amount—Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   The amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than AIGFP's super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended were as follows (there were no collateral postings on this portfolio prior to March 31, 2008):                                          (in millions)   March 31, 2008   June 30, 2008   September 30, 2008   December 31, 2008   March 31, 2009   June 30, 2009   September 30, 2009   October 30, 2009              Reference to market indices   $ 212   $ 177   $ 157   $ 667   $ 598   $ 293   $ 114   $ 73      Market value of referenced obligation     -     142     286     380     317     -     -     -        Expected loss models     -     -     -     5     24     26     27     27      Negotiated amount     -     -     -     235     225     220     236     235              Total   $ 212   $ 319   $ 443   $ 1,287   $ 1,164   $ 539   $ 377   $ 335              Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in  178      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.  The amount of collateral postings with respect to AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended were as follows:                                          (in millions)   March 31, 2008   June 30, 2008   September 30, 2008   December 31, 2008   March 31, 2009   June 30, 2009   September 30, 2009   October 30, 2009              Regulatory capital   $ 212   $ 319   $ 443   $ 1,287   $ 1,164   $ 539   $ 377   $ 335      Arbitrage — multi-sector CDO     7,590     13,241     31,469     5,129     6,208     4,586     3,801     3,864        Arbitrage — corporate     368     259     902     2,349     1,995     1,165     858     688            Total   $ 8,170   $ 13,819   $ 32,814   $ 8,765   $ 9,367   $ 6,290   $ 5,036   $ 4,887              The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the severe market disruption, lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future.   Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio   Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs declined 9.96 percent and 5.57 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first and second quarters of 2009, respectively. However, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, prices for CDOs increased by an average of 5.13 percent of the notional amount outstanding. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current dislocated market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $8.2 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at September 30, 2009, a BET value is available for $5.0 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $3.2 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $5.0 billion.   As mentioned above, the most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities given their significantly depressed valuations.  179      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Given the current difficult market conditions, AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at September 30, 2009 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                          Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at September 30, 2009         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS PRIME   RMBS ALT-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices   37 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (330 ) $ (13 ) $ (31 ) $ (155 ) $ (84 ) $ (29 ) $ (18 )              Decrease of 5 points     295     14     32     118     84     28     19            Weighted       Increase of 1 year     107     6     8     94     (4 )   1     2        average life   4.89 years   Decrease of 1 year     (228 )   (8 )   (11 )   (207 )   1     2     (5 )            Recovery rates   22%   Increase of 10%     (37 )   (3 )   (3 )   (9 )   (12 )   (3 )   (7 )              Decrease of 10%     53     3     5     20     18     3     4            Diversity score(a)   17   Increase of 5     (4 )                                               Decrease of 5     12                                                  Discount curve(b)   N/A   Increase of 100bps     28                                                   (a)The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

This new methodology uses a mathematical model that produces results that are more closely aligned with prices received from third-parties. This methodology is widely used by other market participants and uses the current market credit spreads of the names in the portfolios along with the base correlations implied by the current market prices of comparable tranches of the relevant market traded credit indices  180      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  as inputs. Two transactions, representing two percent of the total notional amount of the corporate arbitrage transactions, are valued using third party quotes given their unique attributes.   These results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption. No assurance can be given that the actual levels of the indices and maturity will not exceed, perhaps significantly, the ranges assumed by AIGFP for purposes of the above analysis. No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these indices and maturity can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above.   Other derivatives. Valuation models that incorporate unobservable inputs initially are calibrated to the transaction price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by observable market data.   Transfers into Level 3   During the three-month period ended September 30, 2009, AIG transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 approximately $3.4 billion of assets, primarily representing downgraded fixed maturity securities for which the observable market prices were not indicative of fair value.

(b)At September 30, 2009, approximately 57 percent and 43 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities, respectively, compared to approximately 54 percent and 46 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2008. 182      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Retirement Services and Asset Management.   Spread-Based Investment business. The primary objectives are liquidity, preservation of capital, growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products. Difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered AIG's ability to achieve these objectives, and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies, as well as in the GIC and MIP portfolios of the Asset Management segment, the fundamental investment strategy is to match, as nearly as is practicable, the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Commercial Insurance historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In light of AIG's net operating losses in the third quarter of 2008, AIG changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax-exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries. Fixed maturity securities held by Foreign General Insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk, and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG records at fair value the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on AIG's balance sheet), AIG does not adjust the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the fair value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At September 30, 2009, approximately 50 percent of the fixed maturity securities were in domestic entities. Approximately 32 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspectives for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2009, approximately 14 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated.

AIG has recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges (severity losses) of $54 million and $7.3 billion in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.8 billion and $16.3 billion in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. With the adoption of the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard on April 1, 2009, such charges in the three months ended September 30, 2009, exclusively related to equity securities and partnership investments. In all prior periods, such charges primarily related to mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized securities, corporate debt securities of financial institutions and other equity securities. Notwithstanding AIG's intent and ability to hold such securities until they had recovered their cost or amortized cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.  192      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  Pricing of CMBS had been adversely affected by concerns that underlying mortgage defaults will increase. As a result, AIG recognized $55 million of other-than-temporary impairment severity charges in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, all in the first quarter prior to adopting the new other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard, on CMBS valued at a severe discount to cost, despite the absence of any meaningful deterioration in performance of the underlying credits, because AIG concluded that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment period was temporary.   In addition to the above severity losses, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 related to:    •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments and private equity investments.    AIG recognized $1.6 billion and $3.3 billion in other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, respectively, due to issuer-specific credit events, and $51 million and $1.0 billion in other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009, respectively, due to changes in intent.   No other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.2 percent of Total equity in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amount of accretion recognized in earnings for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 were $54 million and $519 million, respectively.

(d)The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC. (e)Includes securities lending invested collateral.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased $13.3 billion ($8.6 billion after tax) reflecting an increase in fair value primarily due to the narrowing of credit spreads, partially offset by the reversal of prior other-than-temporary impairment charges in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard which changed the recognition criteria for other-than-temporary impairment charges.

Overview   AIG continues to reassess its risk management control environment and its enterprise risk management functions, both in its individual businesses as well as at the corporate level, in light of AIG's current situation. AIG continues to focus on enhancing its risk management processes and de-risking certain exposures, both at the corporate and business levels in an effort to minimize the capital and liquidity needs of AIG's local legal entities. Continued market  194      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  turmoil and associated price volatility, limited liquidity in the markets and a limitation in the number of counterparties willing to transact with AIG continue to constrain AIG's ability to utilize techniques for mitigating its exposure to credit, market and liquidity risks.  Credit Risk Management   AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives, deposits and letters of credit (both in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity:                         At September 30, 2009  Category   Risk Rating(a)   Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity            Investment Grade:                    10 largest combined     A- (b)   132.3 %(c)      Single largest non-sovereign (financial institution)     BBB-     12.3        Single largest corporate     AA     4.6        Single largest sovereign     AAA     28.3      Non-Investment Grade:                    Single largest sovereign     BB-     2.4        Single largest non-sovereign     BB     0.8               (a)Reflects AIG's internal risk ratings. (b)Three of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions, five are to investment-grade rated sovereigns and two are to government-sponsored entities. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB- or its equivalent. (c)Exposure to the ten largest combined as a percentage of Total equity was 150.7 percent at December 31, 2008.   AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG defines its cross-border exposure to include both cross-border credit exposures and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Seven countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 20 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2009. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at that date, five were rated AAA, one was rated AA and one was rated A.   In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG's single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, insurance and reinsurance companies, and government-sponsored entities.  The following table presents AIG's largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity:                      At September 30, 2009     Credit Exposure as a Percentage of Total Equity            Industry Category:              Money Center / Global Bank Groups     112.2 %*      Government-Sponsored Entities     25.9        Global Life Insurance Companies     18.5        European Regional Financial Institutions     17.5        Global Reinsurance Companies     15.3        Asian Regional Financial Institutions     11.2        North American Based Regional Financial Institutions     10.4               *Exposure to Money Center/Global Bank Groups as a percentage of Total equity was 138.7 percent at December 31, 2008.  195      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries     AIG's exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 45.1 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2009.   Credit exposure to Global Reinsurance Companies was 15.3 percent of Total equity compared to 18.4 percent at December 31, 2008. Credit exposure to Transatlantic, previously a consolidated subsidiary, was added to this category. Transatlantic is now AIG's largest third-party reinsurer with overall credit exposure of just over $2 billion. Transatlantic's core operating subsidiaries have financial strength ratings of A1 by Moody's and A+ by S&P.   AIG also has a risk concentration through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG holds approximately $48.4 billion of tax-exempt and taxable securities issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories. A majority of these securities are held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property-casualty insurance companies. These securities are comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The average credit quality of these issuers is AA-.   Currently, several states, local governments and other issuers are facing pressures on their budget revenues from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG's portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers is the State of California, of which AIG holds approximately $1.1 billion of general obligation bonds and which at September 30, 2009 was also the largest single issuer in AIG's municipal finance portfolio. Nevertheless, despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does not expect any significant defaults in portfolio holdings of municipal issuers.  Insurance Risk Management   Catastrophe Exposures   The nature of AIG's business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year. In order to control this exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting aggregate limits in key business units, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections.   Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIG's operating results. Other risks, such as a pandemic disease, like the Swine Flu Influenza A Virus (H1N1), could adversely affect AIG's business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs.   Pandemic Influenza   On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its alert level to 6 and declared that the new variant influenza A/H1N1 had reached pandemic alert status. Although AIG continues to monitor the developing facts, current evidence suggests that a resulting pandemic will be of moderate severity with some chance that it could be severe. To date, the virus has been mostly mild. The virus is occurring disproportionately in younger people and there is some evidence that individuals over 60 may have some resistance to the virus due to pre-existing immunity. Individuals infected generally recover fully after a few days and hospitalization rates have been low. However, it should be noted that instances have been identified in which the H1N1 virus demonstrated a resistance to Tamiflu, the preferred treatment for the virus. The emergence of this resistant virus, or the emergence of a more virulent virus during the on-coming Northern Hemisphere flu season could result in a more severe pandemic.   A significant global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates.   Utilizing a scenario-based approach and an industry standard model, AIG has analyzed its insurance risk associated with pandemic influenza. For a severe event, considered to be a recurrence of the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the analysis indicates AIG could incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $6.3 billion if this event were to recur. For a mild event,  196      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  considered to be a recurrence of the influenza epidemic of 1968, the analysis indicates AIG could incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $0.6 billion if such an event were to recur. These analyses were based on 2008 policy data representing approximately 95 percent of AIG's individual life, group life and credit life books of business, net of reinsurance at that point in time. These estimates do not include claims that could be made under other policies, such as business interruption or general liability policies, and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of AIG's own business operations or asset valuation losses that may arise consequent to such a pandemic. These related losses may be significant and in some scenarios exceed the losses incurred from AIG's life insurance coverages.       ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2009, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  197                  Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries       Part II – OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings  Included in Note 10(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  The following supplements the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of the 2008 Form 10-K and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part II of AIG's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009.   A deterioration in the credit markets may cause AIG to recognize unrealized market valuation losses in AIGFP's regulatory capital super senior credit default swap portfolio in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Moreover, depending on how the extension of the Basel I capital floors is implemented, the period of time that AIGFP remains at risk for such deterioration could be significantly longer than anticipated by AIGFP.  A total of $171.7 billion in net notional amount of the super senior credit default swap CDS portfolio of AIGFP as of September 30, 2009, represented derivatives written for financial institutions, principally in Europe, for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief rather than for arbitrage purposes. The fair value of the derivative liability for these CDS transactions was $31million at September 30, 2009.   The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of Basel I that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by Basel II. It is expected that financial institution counterparties will have transitioned from Basel I to Basel II by the end of the two-year adoption period on December 31, 2009, after which they will receive little or no additional regulatory benefit from these CDS transactions, except in a small number of specific instances, and therefore AIGFP expects that the counterparties will terminate the majority of these transactions within the next six months. However, the Basel Committee recently announced that it has agreed to keep in place the Basel I capital floors beyond the end of 2009, although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various European Central Banking districts. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets required to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality of the underlying portfolio, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory capital relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will terminate these transactions prior to their maturity. AIGFP will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace. Given the potential for further significant deterioration in the credit markets, there  198      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc., and Subsidiaries  can be no assurance that AIG will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods. Depending on how the extension of the Basel I capital floors is implemented, AIG could also remain at risk for a significantly longer period of time than anticipated. Moreover, given the size of the credit exposure, a decline in the fair value of this portfolio could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition.   The limitations on incentive compensation contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the restrictions placed on compensation by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, may adversely affect AIG's ability to retain and motivate its highest performing employees. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) was signed into law. The Recovery Act contains restrictions on bonus and other incentive compensation payable to the five executives named in a company's proxy statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of companies receiving TARP funds. Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation (Special Master) issued an initial Determination Memorandum on October 22, 2009 with respect to AIG's named executive officers (except for the Chief Executive Officer) and twenty highest paid employees. Although the Determination Memorandum is not yet final, it appears likely to set significant new restrictions on the compensation of these employees. Historically, AIG has embraced a pay-for-performance philosophy. Depending upon the limitations placed on incentive compensation by the final Determination Memorandum issued by the Special Master, it is possible that AIG may be unable to create a compensation structure that permits AIG to retain and motivate its highest performing employees. The Special Master is also reviewing AIG's compensation arrangements for its next 75 most highly compensated employees. Depending on the actions of the Special Master, AIG's ability to retain and motivate these employees may be adversely affected as well. An inability of AIG to retain and motivate its highest performing employees may affect its ability to stabilize its businesses, execute on its asset disposition plan and prepare and make required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal, state and foreign regulators.
