Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of AIG for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2011   99      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   (AIG's 2011 First Quarter Form 10-Q), and in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of AIG for the year ended December 31, 2010 (AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K).     AIG is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "AIG" means AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries.   Use of Non-GAAP Measures   Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of ongoing operations as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations.   AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis using underwriting profit (loss). Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization and goodwill impairment charges, is utilized to report results for SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) operations. Management believes that these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable measurement derived from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), pre-tax income, are included in Results of Operations.   Executive Overview   This executive overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of AIG's financial statements. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety, together with AIG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2011, AIG's 2011 First Quarter Form 10-Q and AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  In order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess performance, changes were made to AIG's segment information. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. AIG now reports the results of its operations as follows:    •Chartis — AIG's property and casualty operations are conducted through multiple-line companies writing substantially all commercial and consumer lines both domestically and abroad. Chartis offers its products through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes agents, wholesalers, global and local brokers, and direct-to-consumer platforms. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, reporting includes the results of Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji), which writes primarily consumer lines in Japan.   •SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) — SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life insurance, universal life insurance, accident and health (A&H) insurance, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms.   •Aircraft Leasing — AIG's commercial aircraft leasing business is conducted through ILFC.   100      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •Other Operations — AIG's Other operations include results from:      •Mortgage Guaranty operations;   •Global Capital Markets operations;   •Direct Investment book results;   •Retained Interests, which represents the fair value gains or losses on the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities that were received as consideration from the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) prior to their sale on March 8, 2011, the AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering, and the retained interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III);   •Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments); and   •those divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting.      Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for the segment changes.  Financial Overview   AIG's loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $4.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2011 compared to income of $0.3 billion for the same period in 2010 primarily driven by the following:    •lower underwriting income for Chartis reflecting significant catastrophe losses of $574 million in the current year period, including losses from Hurricane Irene of $372 million, compared to losses of $72 million in the same period in 2010;   •lower operating income for SunAmerica reflecting a decline in net investment income resulting from fair value losses on Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II, and together with ML III, the Maiden Lane Interests), lower partnership income and losses on an equity method investment, as well as higher DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses due to weaker equity market conditions;   •increased losses for Aircraft Leasing due to impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft of $1.5 billion in 2011 compared to $465 million in 2010;   •a decline in the fair value of AIA ordinary shares of $2.3 billion that offset the majority of the $2.6 billion gain recorded for the first six months of 2011;   •income in 2010 from divested businesses prior to their sale totaling $637 million, primarily representing AIA; and   •a $931 million reduction in the fair value of ML III due to significant spread widening, reduced interest rates and changes in the timing of future estimated cash flows compared to an increase in the fair value of $301 million in the same period in 2010.    Partially offsetting these declines was lower interest expense of $1.4 billion primarily resulting from the January 2011 repayment of the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) Credit Facility) and net realized capital gains in the 2011 period compared to net realized capital losses in 2010.   In the first nine months of 2011, income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $7.4 billion compared to the same period in 2010 and reflected the following:    •a $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the first quarter of 2011, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011;   101      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •significant catastrophe losses for Chartis totaling $2.8 billion, including losses from Hurricane Irene mentioned above, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011 and the Tohoku catastrophe in the first quarter of 2011, compared to catastrophe losses of $873 million in the first nine months of 2010;   •$2.7 billion in unfavorable fair value adjustments on the Maiden Lane Interests;   •an increase in impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft of $711 million; and   •income in 2010 from divested businesses prior to their sale totaling $2.0 billion, primarily representing AIA.    Partially offsetting these declines were lower interest expense of $2.8 billion and a reduction in realized capital losses in 2011 compared to 2010.   In the first nine months of 2011, AIG recorded income from discontinued operations net of taxes, of $1.4 billion, which included a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2011 on the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) compared to a net loss of $4.1 billion in the same period in 2010, which included a goodwill impairment charge of $3.3 billion associated with the sale of ALICO.   See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results and Segment Results for further discussion.  Restructuring Activity Overview   AIG substantially completed its recapitalization plan (the Recapitalization) and its asset disposition plan with the following significant milestones in 2011:    •On January 14, 2011 (the Closing), AIG completed the Recapitalization, which included:      •repaying the $20.7 billion outstanding balance and terminating the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •applying proceeds from the AIA initial public offering and the ALICO sale to partially pay down the SPV Preferred Interests in special purpose vehicles that held AIA and ALICO (the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV, respectively, and collectively, the SPVs). As part of the Recapitalization, AIG used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests. The SPV Preferred Interests were further reduced during 2011 by approximately $11.5 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison, Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) and the MetLife securities received in the sale of ALICO, in each case, discussed below; and   •exchanging preferred stock held by the Department of the Treasury and the AIG Credit Facility Trust (the Trust) for AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock).     •On January 31, 2011, ILFC entered into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility. On March 30, 2011, ILFC entered into a secured $1.3 billion term loan with the right to add an additional $200 million of lender commitments. On April 21, 2011, ILFC increased this loan for a total commitment of $1.5 billion. On May 24, 2011, ILFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent senior Notes Due in 2016 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.25 percent senior Notes Due in 2019. On June 17, 2011, ILFC completed tender offers for the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with maturity dates in 2012 and 2013 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded losses of $61 million on the extinguishment of debt during 2011.   •On February 1, 2011, AIG completed the sale of its Japan-based life insurance subsidiaries, AIG Star and AIG Edison, to Prudential Financial, Inc., for $4.8 billion, consisting of $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in the assumption of third-party debt.   •On March 8, 2011, AIG completed the disposition of the MetLife securities received in the sale of ALICO to MetLife and used $6.6 billion of the proceeds to pay down all of the liquidation preference of the   102      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   Department of the Treasury's ALICO SPV Preferred Interests and pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.    •On August 18, 2011, AIG completed the sale of its 97.57 percent interest in Nan Shan to a Taiwan-based consortium for $2.15 billion in cash. The net proceeds of the transaction were used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.   •On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc. (ILFC Holdings), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding terms or that an offering will be completed. All proceeds from any offering will go to the selling shareholder and are required to be used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.    See Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Other Developments   On May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. A portion of the net proceeds AIG received from this offering, $550 million, is being used to fund a litigation settlement, and AIG intends to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.   On June 17, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. At the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis ceded the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into the Chartis results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims.   On September 13, 2011, AIG received approximately $2.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. AIG expects to use the proceeds from the sale of these notes to pay maturing notes that were issued by AIG to fund the Matched Investment Program (MIP).   On October 12, 2011, the previously outstanding AIG 364-Day Syndicated Facility, AIG 3-Year Syndicated Facility and Chartis letter of credit facility were terminated upon AIG entering into a $1.5 billion 364-Day Syndicated Facility and a $3.0 billion 4-Year Syndicated Facility. The new 4-Year Syndicated Facility provides for $1.5 billion of revolving loans and includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. The $1.3 billion of previously issued letters of credit under the Chartis letter of credit facility were rolled into the letter of credit sublimit within the 4-Year Syndicated Facility, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on these facilities from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.   See Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.  103      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       Outlook   Priorities for 2011 and Beyond   AIG is focused on the following priorities for the remainder of 2011 and beyond:    •continuing to strengthen and grow AIG's businesses;   •developing and implementing plans to maximize the value of resources available for repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury;   •implementing a strategic alternative for ILFC through an initial public offering or sale;   •continuing to build, strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources;   •restructuring AIG's operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness;   •managing its capital more efficiently;   •investing its available cash in order to increase its net investment income; and   •continuing to work towards achieving the long-term aspirational goals with respect to return on equity and earnings per share as discussed in AIG's 2011 First Quarter Form 10-Q.    Chartis   Given the recent global economic environment and current property and casualty market conditions, the remainder of 2011 and the first part of 2012 are expected to remain challenging, but improving trends in certain key indicators may offset some of the challenges. The weakness of ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls, and sales) experienced in 2009 and 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base, as well as continued weakness in commercial insurance rates, were initially expected to continue through 2011. However, in the first nine months of 2011, Chartis has observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the United States is beginning to abate. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2011 and continuing through the third quarter of 2011, Chartis has observed continuing positive pricing trends, particularly in its U.S. commercial business, for the first time since 2009. In certain growth economies such as Brazil, Turkey, India, and Asia Pacific countries, Chartis continues to expect improved growth.   Strategy   Chartis continues to execute its strategy to grow its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business, and to implement corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management continues to review its underlying businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures, while seeking to reduce overall volatility.   In 2011, Chartis determined that it would no longer write Excess Workers' Compensation business as an unsupported, stand-alone product. However, given its commitments to certain insureds to allow them to move their business to other insurance providers in an orderly manner, Chartis will continue to report modest net premium written activity over the next 12 months. Excess Workers' Compensation is also subject to premium audits (upon the expiration of underlying policies), and as a result premium audit activity is expected to continue through subsequent years.   Additionally, during the third quarter of 2011, Chartis began to restructure renewals of certain Commercial Casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure. The deductible structure reduces net premiums written and limits the variability around individual insured premium and claim adjustments when compared to retrospectively rated programs. This overall reduction in the premium and claims adjustment variability creates a corresponding reduction in the required capital needed to support this business. Management expects similar levels of declining net premium written trends in this class of business to continue through the second quarter of 2012.  104      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  The effect of these initiatives decreased net written premiums in the third quarter of 2011 by approximately $323 million. However, given the capital-intensive nature of these classes of business, Chartis expects that over time, these actions will improve its overall return on equity and cost of capital efficiency metrics.   As discussed above, in 2011 Commercial Insurance has continued to experience a decrease in its net premiums written as it executes strategies to restructure certain loss-sensitive programs. To meet its profitability objectives, Commercial Insurance is focused on growing higher margin classes of business, including Financial Lines and Specialty coverages, such as Aerospace, and it is growing its business in regions of opportunity. Commercial Insurance is leveraging its significant geographic footprint and multinational capabilities to serve large and mid-sized businesses with cross-border operations. Chartis is also expanding its presence in the Growth Economies region (which primarily includes Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America) to increase Financial, Casualty and Specialty lines of business, and given its new global organizational design, more effectively leverage underwriting and product best practices to enhance customer and channel management. In the U.S./Canada and Europe regions, Commercial Insurance expects to improve the quality of its portfolio. In the Far East region, management expects to leverage the additional distribution and customer base acquired in connection with the purchase of Fuji.   Consumer Insurance expects continued growth in net premiums written in 2011 and 2012 as a result of its well-established franchises and operations, existing growth strategies in multiple distribution channels and its focus on countries in the Growth Economies region. By implementing selective pricing, underwriting and distribution strategies, net premiums written are expected to grow without increasing Chartis' overall catastrophe exposure. In the U.S. and Canada region, management has focused on expanding the Personal Lines business, such as coverages for the Private Client Group, which target high net worth and affluent customers. In the Far East region, management will continue to integrate Fuji operationally and benefit from the full-year effect of rate increases. In the Europe region, management has focused on maintaining pricing discipline and has observed modest growth. Consumer Insurance continues to grow steadily in the Growth Economies region across all lines of business as a result of growth in the gross domestic product of countries within this region and management's focused execution.   Consumer Insurance generally carries higher acquisition costs than Commercial Insurance, and as a result, Chartis expects an overall increase in its expense ratio in 2011 and 2012 due to the change in the mix of business between Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance. Further, investment in the Growth Economies region is also expected to increase expenses in 2012. However, increases in these expenses are expected to generate business with favorable combined ratios and return on equity measures.   Catastrophes   Thailand has suffered catastrophic flooding at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011 for which Chartis expects claims to be reported in the coming quarter. Chartis is currently analyzing its exposures and as of October 31, 2011 cannot yet quantify liabilities that may result from these events.   Asbestos Liabilities   As part of Chartis' ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk, on June 17, 2011, but with retroactive effect to January 1, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., under which the bulk of Chartis' domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. The transaction with NICO covers potentially volatile U.S.-related asbestos exposures. The transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that Chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by Chartis subsidiaries. The transfer was effected under a reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net asbestos liabilities. In connection with this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into the Chartis results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims.  105      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Under GAAP, any future loss development on this retroactive reinsurance agreement will be reported in the period recognized through the results of operations. The corresponding recovery from NICO will be deferred, and consistent with the original deferred gain, amortized into the results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims.   Investments   Consistent with AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy, Chartis places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies, and to a lesser extent, common stocks, real estate hedge funds and other alternative investments.   Domestically, fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Chartis historically have consisted primarily of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to better optimize its overall investment portfolio, including risk-return and tax objectives of Chartis, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   Chartis makes determinations of other-than-temporary impairments based on the fundamental credit analyses of individual securities. For the Chartis other invested asset classes, more specifically life settlements contracts, impairments are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis. During the second quarter of 2011, Chartis implemented an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individual's health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. Chartis also revised its valuation table, which it is using in estimating future net cash flows. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts. These changes resulted in an increase in the number of life settlement contracts identified as potentially impaired compared to previous analyses. As the overall book of business continues to mature and new medical information continues to become available regarding insureds, updated life expectancy assumptions may result in an increase in impairments relating to these assets. At September 30, 2011, Chartis held 5,998 life settlement contracts, included in Other invested assets, with a carrying value of $4.1 billion and a face value of $19.1 billion.   Recently, a number of courts have addressed various life settlement related issues in their decisions. Chartis does not expect that the rulings in those cases will have a significant effect on its investment in life settlement contracts.   In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The accounting standard update will result in a decrease in the amount of capitalized costs in connection with the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts because AIG will only defer costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business. AIG is currently assessing the effect of adoption of this new standard on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   SunAmerica   SunAmerica continues to pursue its goals of expanding the breadth and depth of its distribution relationships, introducing competitive new products and product riders, repositioning its excess cash and liquidity, maintaining a strong statutory surplus, pro-actively managing expenses and, subject to regulatory approval, increasing dividends paid to AIG Parent. SunAmerica made progress on all of these efforts during the first nine months of 2011, and expects this progress to continue for the remainder of the year.  106      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Annuities   SunAmerica experienced an increase in its variable annuity sales as various distribution partners have resumed sales of SunAmerica's products during 2010 and 2011. SunAmerica's largest pre-financial-crisis variable annuity distribution partner resumed distribution of SunAmerica's products in mid-2011. As a result of broader distribution opportunities, SunAmerica expects variable annuity sales to continue to improve over 2010 levels.   After a period of historic lows, interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first three months of 2011 before declining significantly in the third quarter of 2011. Changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. As a result, SunAmerica's fixed annuity sales declined sequentially from the second quarter of 2011. If the low interest rate environment continues, SunAmerica expects fixed annuities sales to decline from the levels experienced in the first six months of 2011.   Life Insurance   SunAmerica's life insurance business continues to deepen its relationships with its retail independent distributors and expects new life insurance sales to continue to grow at or above industry averages. Additionally, the direct-to-consumer channel has proven to be a highly effective method for consumers to acquire certain types of less complex products. The direct platform provides opportunities to bring innovative product solutions to the market that take advantage of underwriting technologies. Career distribution is focused on agent retention and improving productivity.   Investments   SunAmerica built up a large cash and short-term investment position in the first quarter of 2011 with the intention of purchasing all the assets in the ML II portfolio. With the FRBNY's decision in early 2011 to sell the MLII assets through a competitive sales process, SunAmerica began acquiring other fixed maturity investments, including certain securities from ML II. Beginning late in the first quarter of 2011, SunAmerica started investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer-term higher-yielding securities to improve spreads, while actively managing credit and liquidity risks. SunAmerica made substantial progress commencing in the latter part of the first quarter of 2011 in reducing its cash and short-term investment position from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2010 to $3.8 billion at September 30, 2011.   During 2011, SunAmerica sold approximately $9.6 billion of investments in order to support statutory capital and to generate capital gains to partially preserve the recoverability of the deferred tax assets relating to capital losses and reinvested the proceeds at generally lower rates. Additionally, during prolonged periods of low or declining interest rates, SunAmerica has to re-invest interest and principal payments from its investment portfolios in lower yielding securities. SunAmerica's annuity and universal life products have minimum guaranteed interest rates and other contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals. As a result, continuation of the current low interest rate environment will put pressure on SunAmerica's interest spreads which may reduce future profitability. SunAmerica mitigates this risk through its asset-liability management process, product design elements, and crediting rate strategies. As indicated in the table below, approximately 41 percent of SunAmerica's annuity and universal life account values are currently at their minimum crediting rates as of September 30, 2011. Currently, these products have minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent with the higher rates representing older product designs.  107                Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   The following table presents account values and current crediting rates for SunAmerica's universal life product and fixed annuities:                               September 30, 2011   Current Crediting Rates      (in millions)   At Contractual Minimum Guarantee   1-50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   More than 50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   Total            Universal life insurance   $ 4,004   $ 2,850   $ 3,475   $ 10,329      Fixed annuities     38,484     17,815     36,087     92,386            Total   $ 42,488   $ 20,665   $ 39,562   $ 102,715            Percentage of total     41 %   20 %   39 %   100 %            In applying the equity method of accounting for SunAmerica's partnership investments, AIG consistently uses the most recently available financial information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, which reports have historically been received one to three months prior to the end of AIG's reporting period. The equity markets in general incurred significant negative returns in the third quarter of 2011. Due to this lag in reporting, actual partnership results from the third quarter of 2011 for certain partnerships will be reported in AIG's fourth quarter 2011 operating results as financial data becomes available and are generally expected to reflect such negative returns.   AIG is currently assessing the effect of adoption of the new standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Aircraft Leasing   ILFC continues to execute on its strategy to manage its fleet of aircraft by ordering new aircraft with high customer demand and through potential sales or part-outs of its older aircraft which cannot be economically leased to customers. As new and more fuel efficient aircraft enter the marketplace and negatively affect the demand for older aircraft, lease rates on older aircraft may deteriorate and ILFC may incur additional losses on sales or record impairment charges and fair value adjustments.   On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding terms or that any offering will be completed.   On October 7, 2011, ILFC completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of AeroTurbine, Inc. (AeroTurbine) from AerCap, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of $228 million. AeroTurbine is one of the world's largest providers of certified aircraft engines, aircraft and engine parts and supply chain solutions. In connection with the acquisition, ILFC also agreed to guarantee AeroTurbine's $425 million secured revolving credit facility, which had $269 million outstanding as of November 1, 2011 and matures on December 14, 2011.   Other Operations   Mortgage Guaranty   UGC has continued to improve its new book of business through differentiated pricing and improved underwriting practices. In older books of business, primarily the 2005 to 2008 books, newly reported delinquencies continued to decline while increased claims severity and overturns on previously denied claims unfavorably affected results. UGC continued to deny claims and rescind coverage on loans (collectively referred to as rescissions) related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations  108      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  from contractual terms, mostly with respect to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations resulted in loan rescissions totaling $584 million of claims on first-lien business during the first nine months of 2011 compared to $515 million during the same period in 2010. Although rescissions will continue to have a positive effect on UGC's financial results, higher levels of appeals and overturns resulting from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues have unfavorably affected results. While these items may increase volatility in the future, AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans after consideration of rescissions and overturns, consistent with industry practice.   Foreclosure moratoriums as a result of state attorneys general investigations into lenders' foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 have slowed the reporting of claims from foreclosures. UGC's assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend. UGC expects that this trend may continue and may negatively affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is uncertain and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution, individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition.   In March 2011, federal regulators, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) whereby a maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80 percent would be required for a home purchase transaction. The LTV is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan. The final regulations could adversely impact UGC's volume of domestic first-lien new insurance written, depending on the final definition of a QRM, the maximum LTV allowed and the benefit, if any, ascribed to private mortgage insurance.   Global Capital Markets   The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis, although the portfolio may experience periodic mark-to-market volatility.   Direct Investment Book   MIP assets and liabilities and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (AIGFP) (collectively the Direct Investment book or DIB) are currently managed on a collective program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent. Liquidity requirements for the DIB are satisfied by transferring cash between AIG Parent and AIGFP as needed. Program management is focused on reducing and managing liquidity requirements, including contingent liquidity requirements arising from collateral posting requirements, for both derivative and debt positions of the DIB. As part of this program management, AIG may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions.   Retained Interests   Retained Interests may continue to experience volatility due to fair value gains or losses on the AIA ordinary shares and the retained interest in ML III.   Corporate & Other   In 2011, AIG completed the Recapitalization, executed transactions in the debt and equity capital markets and substantially completed its asset disposition plan. It is expected that declines in interest expense and disposition activity costs will be at least partially offset in the short term by increases in other corporate expenses, primarily attributable to corporate initiatives and efforts to continue improving internal controls and financial and operating technology platforms.  109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  On October 11, 2011, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) published a second notice of proposed rulemaking and related interpretive guidance under the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the designation of non-bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The new proposal sets forth a three-stage determination process for designating non-bank SIFIs. In Stage 1, FSOC would apply a set of uniform quantitative thresholds to identify the nonbank financial companies that will be subject to further evaluation. Based on its financial condition as of September 30, 2011, AIG would meet the criteria in Stage 1 and would be subject to further evaluation by FSOC in the SIFI determination process. Because Stages 2 and 3 as proposed would involve qualitative judgment by FSOC, AIG cannot predict whether it would be designated as a non-bank SIFI under the proposed rule.   The remainder of this MD&A is organized as follows:                             Index   Page            Results of Operations     111        Consolidated Results     111        Segment Results     116          Chartis Operations     117            Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense     130          SunAmerica Operations     135          Aircraft Leasing Operations     142          Other Operations     144      Capital Resources and Liquidity     150      Investments     163        Investment Strategy     163        Other-Than-Temporary Impairments     175      Enterprise Risk Management     180      Critical Accounting Estimates     185               AIG has incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.  110                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

Premiums   Premiums decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 reflecting declines of $2.5 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, as a result of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in premiums for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was partially offset by growth in Chartis premiums, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010 and foreign exchange rates.  111      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Policy Fees   Policy fees decreased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to lower variable annuity fees on the separate account assets. This decrease is consistent with the decline in variable account assets as a result of declines in equity markets in the three month period ended September 30, 2011.   Policy fees increased slightly for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher variable annuity fees on the separate account assets consistent with the growth in variable accounts assets as a result of positive equity market conditions in late 2010 and early 2011.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, Net investment income decreased due to the following:    •a decline in fair values of the Maiden Lane Interests;   •lower income from fixed maturity securities reflecting a lower level of invested assets, primarily due to the effect of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010; and   •fair value losses on the MetLife securities prior to their sale in March 2011.   112      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  These were partially offset by fair value gains on the AIA ordinary shares and higher income from partnership investments, particularly in the first six months of 2011.

These gains were partially offset by losses from derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting compared to gains in the year-ago period resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British pound, as well as a decrease in interest rates.   AIG recorded a decline in Net realized capital losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to the following:    •gains on sales of fixed maturity securities as part of AIG's portfolio repositioning strategy;   •gains from derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting compared to losses in the year-ago period which resulted from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc; and   •lower other-than-temporary impairment charges from issuer-specific credit events and changes in intent.    These gains were partially offset by foreign exchange transaction losses incurred compared to gains in the same period last year primarily from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc.   Aircraft Leasing Revenue   Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 due to a reduction in ILFC's average fleet size resulting from sales of aircraft and the impact of lower lease rates on used aircraft. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC had an average of 934 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 943 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC had an average of 933 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 968 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010.  113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Other Income   The decline in Other income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was driven by unrealized market valuation adjustments on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits.   The decline in Other income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was driven by credit valuation adjustments on Direct Investment book assets and liabilities as well as unrealized market valuation adjustments on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits. This decline was partially offset by credit valuation adjustments on AIGFP's derivative assets and liabilities as well as lower levels of real estate investment impairment charges and gains on real estate asset divestments.   For the first nine months of 2011, Other income was also impacted by the effect of deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of AIG's third party asset management business in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, the first nine months of 2010 also reflected a bargain purchase gain of $332 million recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   See Segment Results — Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Global Capital Markets Results and Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred   The declines in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 reflected declines of $2.6 billion and $6.6 billion related to the deconsolidation of AIA. These declines were partially offset in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 by the effect of Chartis' consolidation of Fuji and increased catastrophe losses, including Hurricane Irene in the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011, and the Tohoku Catastrophe in the first quarter of 2011.   Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs   The increase in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 resulted primarily from increases in amortization for SunAmerica related to weaker equity market conditions. Amortization also increased as a result of the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010, which was partially offset by the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010.   Other Acquisition and Insurance Expenses   Other acquisition and insurance expenses decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 as a result of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010.   Interest Expense   Interest expense decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 primarily as a result of the repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.   Aircraft Leasing Expenses   During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $1.5 billion compared to charges of $465 million in the same period in 2010. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $1.7 billion compared to charges of $962 million in the same period in 2010. See Segment Results — Aircraft Leasing Operations — Aircraft Leasing Results for additional information.  114      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Loss on Extinguishment of Debt   The loss on extinguishment of debt for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 includes:    •a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt resulting from ILFC's completion of tender offers to purchase notes on June 17, 2011;   •an $18 million loss from the extinguishment of debt associated with AIG's Equity Units during the second quarter of 2011; and   •a $3.3 billion charge primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.    Other Expenses   Other expenses include expenses associated with Global Capital Markets, Direct Investment book and other corporate expenses. Other expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, due to severance expenses and asset write-offs relating to infrastructure consolidation initiatives and an increase in the provision for legal contingencies. Other expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to lower securities-related litigation charges and lower operating costs due to the effect of deconsolidation in 2010 of certain portfolio investments and the 2010 sale of AIG's third party asset management business.   Income Taxes       Interim Tax Calculation Method    In the first quarter of 2011, AIG began using the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provisions. The recent stabilization of operations and expected financial results allow AIG to estimate the annual effective tax rate to be applied to year-to-date income.   From the third quarter of 2008 through December 31, 2010, the discrete-period method was used to compute the interim tax provisions due to the significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre-tax accounting income.   The estimated annual effective tax rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 exclude the tax effects of current year losses of the U.S. consolidated income tax group and, in Japan, Fuji. The related tax benefit with respect to these jurisdictions is currently projected to be offset by an increase in the valuation allowance prior to intraperiod tax allocation.   Certain items, including losses in jurisdictions where no corresponding tax benefit is available, and those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to that item is treated discretely, and is reported in the same period as the related item. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, the tax effects related to the U.S. consolidated income tax group and Fuji, foreign realized capital gains and losses, and divestiture gains or losses were treated as discrete items.       Interim Tax Expense (Benefit)    For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, the effective tax rates on pretax loss from continuing operations were 14.5 and 28.5 percent, respectively. The tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance attributable to the anticipated inclusion of ALICO SPV within the U.S. consolidated income tax group, tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, investments in partnerships, and effective settlements of certain uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations.   For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIG recorded an increase in the U.S. consolidated income tax group valuation allowance of $1.2 billion. The entire $1.2 billion increase in the valuation allowance  115      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  was allocated to continuing operations. This allocation was based on the primacy of continuing operations, which requires a net increase in valuation allowance to be attributed to continuing operations to the extent of the related deferred tax benefit attributable to continuing operations. The amount allocated to continuing operations also included the decrease to the valuation allowance attributable to the anticipated inclusion of ALICO SPV within the U.S. consolidated income tax group.   For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, the effective tax rates on pre-tax income from continuing operations were 158.8 percent and 30.3 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to the effect of foreign operations, nondeductible losses, realized gains resulting from transfers of subsidiaries, and uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a net reduction of the valuation allowance and by the tax benefit associated with tax exempt interest. The effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to the effect of foreign operations, nondeductible losses and realized gains resulting from transfers of subsidiaries, partially offset by the bargain purchase gain associated with the acquisition of Fuji, the tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income, and a reduction in the valuation allowance.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Segment Results   AIG presents and discusses its financial information in a manner it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis, using underwriting profit (loss). AIG analyzes the operating performance of SunAmerica using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization and goodwill impairment charges. Results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses are excluded from these measures. AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.  116      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

During the third quarter of 2011, Chartis completed the previously announced reorganization of its operations. Under the new structure, Chartis now presents its financial information in two operating segments — Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, as well as a Chartis Other category. Prior to the third quarter of 2011, Chartis presented its financial information in two primary operating segments, Chartis U.S. and Chartis International.   Commercial Insurance — Distributed primarily through insurance brokers to businesses. Major lines of business include property, casualty, financial and specialty (including aerospace, environmental, marine, export credit and political risk coverages, and various product offerings to small and medium enterprises (SME)).   Consumer Insurance — Primarily sells its products to individual consumers or groups of consumers through individual agents, brokers, and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Offerings within Consumer Insurance include accident & health (A&H), personal property and casualty lines, and life insurance.   Complementing this structure, Chartis is organized into four principal regions: U.S. and Canada, Europe, Far East, and Growth Economies.   Chartis Other consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including Excess Workers' Compensation and Asbestos, certain Chartis expenses relating to global initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, net investment income, realized capital gains and losses, bargain purchase gains relating to the purchase of Fuji and gains relating to the sale of properties.   During 2011, as part of its on-going initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines, Chartis determined to cease writing Excess Workers' Compensation business as a stand-alone product. Based on this decision, Chartis further determined that this legacy line of business would be included in Chartis Other and not included in the ongoing Commercial Insurance operating results.  117                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies for short duration contracts. The unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally recognized in earnings ratably over the policy period. Net premiums written for long duration contracts are recognized when due from the policyholder. Net premiums written reflect the premiums retained after purchasing reinsurance protection.   Chartis, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses, which consist of acquisition costs plus other insurance expenses, divided by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is a sum of the loss ratio and expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims, claims adjustment expenses, and other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.   The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affects such ratios. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio.   Going forward, Chartis will continue to assess the performance of its operating segments based in part on underwriting income. However, Chartis is implementing a risk-adjusted profitability model which will serve as its primary business performance measure when it is fully deployed. Along with underwriting results, this model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital, and components of net investment income. When the model is fully deployed, components of net investment income will be included in each of the Chartis operating segments. As noted above, net investment income is included only in the Chartis Other category at this time. Chartis expects that its risk-adjusted profitability model will be fully deployed in the first quarter of 2012.   For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, results reflect the effects of three quarters of Fuji operations while the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of Fuji for only one quarter. Chartis acquired  118      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  control of Fuji on March 31, 2010. However, Fuji's financial information is reported on a one-quarter lag. As a result, Fuji's operating results were included in the Chartis results beginning on July 1, 2010.       Chartis Net Premiums Written   Net premiums written are the sales revenue of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is part of the unearned premium reserve.

Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, Commercial Insurance net premiums written were down. This decline is due in large part to certain management initiatives within Commercial Insurance designed to provide for a more effective use of capital, including:    •restructuring the renewals of certain Commercial Casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure; and   •management's decision to cease writing Excess Workers' Compensation business as a stand-alone product.    The effect of these actions decreased premiums in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 by approximately $323 million and $422 million, respectively. However, given the capital intensive nature of these classes of casualty business, Chartis expects that over time, these actions will improve its overall return on equity and cost of capital efficiency metrics.   Partially offsetting these declines are increases in Property and Specialty net premiums written due primarily to increased property rates within the U.S. and Canada and Far East regions and higher new business and retention ratios.   Growing the higher margin Consumer Insurance business continues to be a key Chartis strategy. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, for the three months ended September 30, 2011, Consumer Insurance net premiums written declined. Where Consumer line programs do not meet internal performance or operating targets, management takes appropriate remedial actions, which included in the first quarter of 2011, the decision to de-emphasize two specific programs, resulting in expected declines within Consumer Insurance for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 in the U.S. and Canada region.   The nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 reflects net premiums written related to Fuji of $2.8 billion compared to $867 million in the same period of 2010. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 also reflects the effects of overall improvements in ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls and sales), general pricing improvement and retrospective premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts. Additionally, during 2010, Chartis entered into a three-year reinsurance agreement, secured through the issuance of catastrophe bonds, which provides protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes and reduced 2010 net premiums written by approximately $104 million.

Chartis Underwriting Ratios  The following table summarizes the Chartis combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts on the Chartis consolidated loss and combined ratios:                                         Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,              Increase/ (Decrease)   Increase/ (Decrease)         2011   2010   2011   2010              Loss ratio      75.6      71.1      4.5      79.6      71.5      8.1        Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (6.4 )    (0.9 )    (5.5 )    (10.6 )    (3.6 )    (7.0 )      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.8 )    (2.1 )    1.3      (0.5 )    (0.3 )    (0.2 )          Loss ratio, as adjusted      68.4      68.1      0.3      68.5      67.6      0.9            Expense ratio      30.8      28.2      2.6      30.0      29.7      0.3            Combined ratio      106.4      99.3      7.1      109.6      101.2      8.4        Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums      (6.4 )    (0.9 )    (5.5 )    (10.6 )    (3.6 )    (7.0 )      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.8 )    (2.1 )    1.3      (0.5 )    (0.3 )    (0.2 )          Combined ratio, adjusted      99.2      96.3      2.9      98.5      97.3      1.2              Quarterly & Year-to-Date Loss Ratios   The increase in the loss ratio in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 reflects the effect of increased catastrophe losses in those periods as shown in the table below.   For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, Chartis recorded net adverse prior year development of $62 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $25 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts and including a reserve discount charge of $7 million). During the corresponding three-month period in 2010, Chartis recorded net adverse prior year loss development of $168 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $40 million relating to loss-sensitive contracts and including a reserve discount benefit of $153 million).   For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to:    •An increase in the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Specialty Workers' Compensation and Excess Casualty business (within the U.S. and Canada region) and the Primary Casualty and Professional Indemnity businesses (within the Europe region) as a result of the current year loss ratios established in connection with the 2010 loss reserve study; and   •The acquisition of Fuji, which for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 reported an adjusted loss ratio (excluding the effects of catastrophes, prior year development and reinstatement premiums) of 69.9 and 70.7, respectively.    These increases were partially offset by an improvement in the current accident year loss ratio within A&H class of business, largely reflecting the effects of underwriting improvement actions initiated within the Far East region.  121      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, Chartis recorded net adverse prior year development of $85 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $153 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts and including a reserve discount charge of $49 million) compared to $77 million (including returned premium adjustments of $18 million relating to loss-sensitive contracts and net of a reserve discount benefit of $153 million) in the corresponding 2010 period.   In addition to the items noted above, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to an increase on losses in short tail lines.

All other events includes two events in the three-month period and 12 events in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, that are considered catastrophic but the net impact of which remains below the $200 million itemization threshold.   Quarterly & Year-to-Date Expense Ratios   The expense ratio increased for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010, primarily due to the effects of foreign exchange, an increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs for Fuji, changes in the mix of business and investment in strategic initiatives.   Chartis recorded amortization of deferred acquisition costs for Fuji of $112 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to $25 million for the same period in 2010. The increase was due to the amortization of costs that were deferred beginning after the acquisition of Fuji in 2010.   Management continues to execute on its strategy to grow its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, Consumer Insurance represented 37 percent of the Chartis net premiums written compared to 33 percent in the comparable prior year period. Consumer Insurance generally has higher acquisition costs than Commercial Insurance, and as a result, the overall expense ratio increased due to the business mix change.  122      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Chartis also increased investments in a number of strategic initiatives during 2011, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, the implementation of global accounting and claims systems, preparation for Solvency II and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives.       Commercial Insurance   Commercial Insurance distributes its products through a network of agencies, independent retail and wholesale brokers, and branches. These products are categorized into four major lines of business:    •Casualty: Includes general liability, commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages. Also includes insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products.   •Property: Includes industrial and commercial property insurance products, which cover exposures to man-made and natural disasters.   •Specialty: Includes environmental, political risk, export credit, SME, surety, marine, and aerospace coverages.   •Financial: Includes various forms of professional liability insurance, including director and officer (D&O), fidelity, employment practices, fiduciary liability, kidnap and ransom, and errors and omissions coverages that protect individual insureds and corporate entities.

Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, Commercial Insurance net premiums written was down; and   •Restructuring the renewals of certain Commercial Casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure. Premium and claims adjustments under a retrospectively rated premium structure can fluctuate significantly, should losses within the stipulated loss occurrence limit vary from the initial estimates made at the program's inception. Given the policy form of the deductible structure, changes in loss emergence that varies from initial estimates are adjusted through deductible recoveries. The deductible structure, relative to retrospectively rated programs, results in reductions to net premiums written and corresponding claim reserves at renewal. However, the overall reduction in net premium written and claim reserves has a corresponding decrease in the capital required to support this business. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, the decline in net   123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   premiums written relating to this initiative was approximately $297 million. However, given the capital intensive nature of this class of business, Chartis expects that over time, this action will improve its overall return on equity and cost of capital efficiency metrics.     Offsetting these reductions were increases in the Property, Specialty and Financial lines of business. The increase in Property relates primarily to rate increases within the U.S. and Canada and Far East regions, which serves to increase premiums with no corresponding increase in loss exposure. Increases in Specialty and Financial lines reflect the effects of increases within the Growth Economies region and higher new business submission and premium retention levels. Chartis experienced an overall improving rate environment in the third quarter of 2011.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the overall increase in Commercial Insurance net premiums written is due to:    •An increase of $171 million compared to the corresponding 2010 period within the Commercial Casualty loss-sensitive business. Loss-sensitive business relates to policies whose premiums vary with the level of underlying losses. Accordingly, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, additional premiums of $153 million were recorded because a comparable amount of additional prior year losses were recognized. Conversely, the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of return premiums of $18 million because loss experience emerged more favorably;   •Improvements in ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls and sales), general rate improvement, more specifically in Specialty Workers' Compensation (within the U.S. and Canada region);   •Continued growth and market penetration across all countries in the Growth Economies region;   •Increases in Property lines as a result of continued positive pricing trends in the U.S. and Canada and Far East regions. Additionally, the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of a three-year reinsurance agreement, secured through catastrophe bonds, which provided protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes and reduced 2010 net premiums written by approximately $104 million; and   •One large errors and omissions policy issued within the U.S. and Canada region.    Offsetting these increases was a $396 million decrease in net premiums written relating to the change of certain policy forms at renewal from retrospectively rated premium structures to a loss reimbursement deductible structures.  Commercial Insurance business is transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Commercial Insurance net premiums written:                            Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          2011 vs. 2010   2011 vs. 2010            Increase (decrease) in original currency*      (3.2 )%   5.0 %    Foreign exchange effect     2.4     1.4            Increase (decrease) as reported in U.S. dollars      (0.8 )%   6.4 %             * Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.   124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, Commercial Insurance recorded net adverse prior year development of $15 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $25 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts). During the corresponding period in 2010, Commercial Insurance recorded net adverse prior year loss development of $44 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $40 million relating to loss-sensitive contracts and including a reserve discount benefit of $100 million).   For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, Commercial Insurance recorded net favorable prior year development of $54 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $153 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts). During the corresponding period in 2010, Commercial Insurance recorded net favorable prior year loss development of $81 million (net of returned premium adjustments of $18 million relating to loss-sensitive contracts and including a reserve discount benefit of $100 million).   For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to an increase in the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Specialty Workers' Compensation and Excess Casualty business (within the U.S. and Canada region) and the Primary Casualty and Professional Indemnity lines (within the Europe region) as a result of the current year loss ratios established in connection with the 2010 loss reserve study. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased due to an increase in losses on short tail lines, most notably within Property lines.   For a more detailed discussion of Net Prior Year Loss Development, see the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense section that follows.  125      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Quarterly & Year-to-Date Expense Ratios   For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, the overall increase in the expense ratio is due to the effects of foreign exchange and an overall increase in certain acquisition expenses, most notably within Property Lines. In addition, the increase in expense ratio reflects the effects of continued enhancements to regional governance, risk management capabilities and investments within countries in the Growth Economies region.       Consumer Insurance   Consumer Insurance distributes its products through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet. Consumer Insurance products are categorized into three major lines of business:    •Accident & Health: Includes voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accidental and supplemental health products, including accidental death and disability, accidental medical reimbursement, hospital indemnity and medical excess for individuals, employees, associations and other organizations. It also includes a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers, including trip cancellation, trip interruption, lost baggage, travel assistance and concierge services.   •Personal Lines: Includes automobile, homeowners and extended warranty insurance. It also includes coverages for high net worth individuals (offered through the Chartis Private Client Group), including umbrella, yacht and fine art and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection.   •Life Insurance: Includes life products offered through Fuji.

Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased 4 percent in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to the following:    •Accident & Health business grew 9 percent, including the effect of foreign exchange. Far East region continued to implement favorable marketing programs and benefited from rate increases implemented in 2010. Growth was also demonstrated in the Growth Economies region.   •Personal Lines business declined slightly, one percent, including the effect of foreign exchange. In the U.S. and Canada region, management de-emphasized two specific programs that did not meet internal   126      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   performance targets, resulting in expected declines for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.    •Life business increased 21 percent, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on account of the execution of new business strategies at Fuji.   •Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, for the three months ended September 30, 2011, Consumer Insurance net premiums written were down.    In the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Consumer Insurance grew net premiums written by 25 percent. These results reflect the effects of three quarters of Fuji net premiums written while the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of Fuji for only one quarter.

Consumer Insurance Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents the Consumer Insurance combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts on the Consumer Insurance consolidated loss and combined ratios:                                          Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,              Increase (Decrease)   Increase (Decrease)         2011   2010   2011   2010              Loss ratio      64.5      61.6      2.9      68.0      60.0      8.0        Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premium      (3.7 )    (0.2 )    (3.5 )    (6.9 )    (0.9 )    (6.0 )      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.9 )    0.3      (1.2 )    (0.6 )    0.4      (1.0 )          Loss ratio, as adjusted      59.9      61.7      (1.8 )    60.5      59.5      1.0            Expense ratio      36.8      33.7      3.1      36.2      38.0      (1.8 )          Combined ratio      101.3      95.3      6.0      104.2      98.0      6.2        Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premium      (3.7 )    (0.2 )    (3.5 )    (6.9 )    (0.9 )    (6.0 )      Prior year development net of premium adjustments and including reserve discount      (0.9 )    0.3      (1.2 )    (0.6 )    0.4      (1.0 )          Combined ratio, as adjusted      96.7      95.4      1.3      96.7      97.5      (0.8 )           127                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   Quarterly & Year-to-Date Loss Ratios   The increase in the loss ratio in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 reflects the effect of increased catastrophe losses in those periods as shown in the table above. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, Consumer Insurance recorded net adverse prior year development of $30 million and $58 million, respectively, compared to favorable net development of $8 million and $30 million for the same respective periods of 2010.   For a more detailed discussion of Net Prior Year Loss Development, see the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense section that follows.   Quarterly & Year-to-Date Expense Ratios   The increase in the expense ratio in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Fuji during 2010. Substantially all of Fuji's business is part of Consumer Insurance. Chartis recorded amortization of deferred acquisition costs of $112 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to amortization of $25 million for the same period in 2010. The increase was due to the amortization of acquisition costs that were deferred beginning after the Fuji acquisition.   The decrease in the expense ratio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily attributable to Fuji. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, results reflect three quarters of Fuji operations, while the corresponding 2010 period reflects Fuji operations for one quarter. Fuji has a lower average expense ratio than the rest of the Consumer Insurance business, which resulted in the overall decrease in the expense ratio. In addition, the expense ratio decreased due to the benefit associated from the amortization of net intangible liabilities from the Fuji acquisition, which increased by $73 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.       Chartis Other   Chartis Other consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including Excess Workers' Compensation and Asbestos, certain Chartis expense relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, net investment income, realized capital gains and losses, bargain purchase gains relating to the purchase of Fuji and gains relating to the sale of properties.

Underwriting Results    Given the run-off nature of the legacy lines of business and the nature of the expenses included in Chartis Other, management has determined that traditional underwriting measures of loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio do not provide an appropriate measure of underwriting performance as they do for its ongoing Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments. Therefore, underwriting ratios are not presented for the Chartis Other category.   For both the three and nine months ended, September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010, the decline in both net premiums written and claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred reflect the effects of the run-off activities associated with the Excess Workers' Compensation and Asbestos operations. All of the net premiums written in the above table relate to Excess Workers' Compensation. The Excess Workers' Compensation line of business is subject to premium audits (upon the expiration of the underlying policy) and as a result Chartis Other will reflect the effects of premium audit activity through subsequent years.   The overall increase in underwriting expenses relates to increases for strategic Chartis initiatives, including global accounting and claims system implementations, Solvency II and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives.    Investing Results    For the three months ended September 30, 2011, the increase in net investment income is due to increases in interest relating to fixed maturity securities due to the continued shift in investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments within the U.S. which meet overall liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. In addition, the increase relates to redeployment of cash and short term instruments into to longer term, higher yield securities. This increase is partially offset by reduced gains on matured life settlement contracts.   The increase in net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was due, in part, to Fuji investment income, which has been consolidated in the Chartis results since July 1, 2010.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010, increases in net realized capital gains and losses are due to gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities (primarily municipal bonds) in connection with the aforementioned strategy to better align Chartis' investment allocations with current overall performance and tax objectives. In addition, the increase is due to foreign exchange transaction gains on derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, which were primarily the result of the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollar. These gains were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments recognized within other invested assets classes, including life settlement contracts and to a lesser extent residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and equity investments held by Fuji.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, other-than-temporary impairment charges of $36 million and $290 million, respectively, were recorded by Chartis related to life settlement contracts, including approximately $16 million and $35 million of impairments, respectively, associated with life insurance policies issued by SunAmerica life insurance companies that are eliminated at the AIG consolidated level.   At September 30, 2011, the domestic operations of Chartis held 5,998 life settlement contracts, with a carrying value of $4.1 billion and face value of $19.1 billion, of which 155 contracts with a carrying value of $159 million and face value of approximately $503 million relate to life insurance policies issued by SunAmerica life insurance companies. Impairments of life settlement contracts are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis and a contract is identified as potentially impaired if its undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the current carrying value of such contract. Potentially impaired contracts are impaired, and written down to fair value, when the carrying value of the contract is greater than the estimated fair value.   During the second quarter of 2011, the domestic operations of Chartis began receiving updated medical information as a result of an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individual's health has  129      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. The domestic operations of Chartis also revised their valuation table during the second quarter, which they use in estimating future net cash flows. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts. In the second quarter of 2011, these changes resulted in an increase in the number of contracts identified as potentially impaired compared to previous analyses. Further, the domestic operations of Chartis refined their fair values based upon the availability of recent medical information.   The bargain purchase gain of $332 million in 2010 was recognized in connection with the acquisition of Fuji.   See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense — Asbestos and Environmental Reserves herein for further discussion.       Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense    The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for Chartis as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in AIG's Other operations category.       The following table presents the components of the loss reserves by major lines of business on a statutory basis*:                          (in millions)   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Other liability occurrence    $ 23,786    $ 23,583      International      18,726      16,583      Workers' compensation      17,550      17,683      Other liability claims made      11,606      11,446      Property      5,988      3,846      Auto liability      3,124      3,337      Mortgage guaranty credit      3,010      4,220      Products liability      2,429      2,377      Medical malpractice      1,702      1,754      Accident and health      1,583      1,444      Commercial multiple peril      1,134      1,006      Aircraft      1,022      1,149      Fidelity/surety      799      934      Other      1,323      1,789            Total    $ 93,782    $ 91,151               * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.   AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  130      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit:                           (in millions)   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Chartis:                    Commercial Insurance    $ 59,168    $ 57,344        Consumer Insurance      5,853      5,030        Other      5,708      5,700            Total Chartis      70,729      68,074            Other operations – Mortgage Guaranty      2,972      3,433            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 73,701    $ 71,507                    Discounting of Reserves   At September 30, 2011, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.17 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 - 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain other asbestos business that was written by Chartis is discounted based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business. The discount is comprised of the following: $790 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in the domestic operations of Chartis and $2.27 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in the domestic operations of Chartis; and $113 million — non-tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.       Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of September 30, 2011. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of September 30, 2011. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  131      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Offsetting the unfavorable development were related additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $153 million in 2011. Returned premiums of $18 million offset the favorable development in 2010.   In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for that period. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   See Chartis Results herein and Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.       Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.   As described more fully in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount and a minor adjustment to the environmental gross and net reserves are reflected in the table below.   On June 17, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO as part of Chartis' ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk. The transaction with NICO covers potentially volatile U.S.-related asbestos exposures. The transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that Chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by Chartis subsidiaries.   Upon the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis ceded the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into income over the settlement period of the underlying claims. The minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount noted above is primarily related to the reserves subject to the NICO reinsurance agreement.  133                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

Survival Ratios — Asbestos and Environmental   The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at September 30, 2011 and 2010. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at September 30, 2010 by approximately 0.2 years and 0.6 years, respectively.   Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves are not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.       The following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                     2011    2010      Nine Months Ended September 30,   Gross   Net*   Gross   Net            Survival ratios:                                Asbestos      8.9      10.0      4.9      4.6        Environmental      2.9      2.7      4.1      3.4        Combined      8.3      8.9      4.8      4.4               * Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis of presentation in the reserve activity table above, which excludes the effects of the NICO cession.

Pre-tax income for SunAmerica reflected $38 million of net realized capital gains in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to $20 million of net realized capital gains in the same period in 2010. The three-month period ended September 30, 2011 included a $227 million increase in fair value losses of embedded derivatives, net of economic hedges, compared to the same period in 2010, driven by declines in long- term interest rates and increased volatility in the equity markets. These losses were partially offset by foreign currency gains, net of hedges on guaranteed investment contract (GIC) reserves and decreases in the allowance for mortgage and bank loans. See Results of Operations — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).       Year-to-Date SunAmerica Results   SunAmerica reported a decrease in operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, reflecting the following:    •lower net investment income and an increase of approximately $100 million in incurred but not reported (IBNR) death claims. Net investment income declined due to a $404 million decrease in valuation gains on ML II, $128 million of losses related to the previously discussed equity-method investments, lower call and tender income and an overall decline in base yields as investment purchases in 2010 and early 2011 were made at yields lower than the weighted average yields of the base portfolio. These declines in net investment income were partially offset by a $226 million increase in partnership income; and   •DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses of approximately $160 million due to weak equity market conditions compared to an approximate $6 million reduction to expenses in 2010.   137      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  SunAmerica's life insurance companies have received industry-wide regulatory inquiries with respect to claims settlement practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws. SunAmerica has enhanced its claims practices to use information such as the Social Security Death Master File to determine when insureds have died, and thus increased its estimated reserves for IBNR death claims by approximately $100 million in the second quarter of 2011. This estimate did not change significantly in the third quarter of 2011. Prior to the second quarter of 2011, SunAmerica already had robust practices relating to insurance claims settlements and compliance with unclaimed property laws that are consistent with applicable legal requirements and historical industry standards.   Pre-tax income for SunAmerica reflected a decline in net realized capital losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due principally to a $704 million decline in other-than-temporary impairments, a decline in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves, and declines in the allowance for mortgage loans.

Total premiums, deposits and other considerations increased in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 as deposits from individual fixed annuities, individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds all showed significant increases.   Group retirement deposits increased primarily due to an increase in individual rollover deposits. Individual fixed annuity deposits increased as certain bank distributors negotiated a lower commission in exchange for a higher rate offered to policyholders which made SunAmerica's individual fixed products more attractive. However, individual fixed annuity deposits were down sequentially from the three months ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to the low interest rate environment experienced during the third quarter. Variable annuity sales increased due to reinstatements at a number of key broker-dealers, and increased wholesaler productivity. Retail mutual funds increased as a result of increased sales due to a sales strategy surrounding cyclical investment themes. The decline in life insurance deposits was primarily driven by lower payout and deferred annuity sales and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, lower institutional life sales.   Retail life insurance sales increased as product enhancements and efforts to re-engage independent distribution continue to produce results. Sales of large institutional life policies decreased from prior periods which included significant variable universal life sales.  139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Net flows improved in 2011 due to the impact of both the significant increase in deposits and favorable surrender experience in group retirement and individual fixed annuities. Surrender rates for individual fixed annuities have decreased in 2011 due to the low interest rate environment and the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. SunAmerica has returned to a more normal level of group surrender activity that no longer reflects the negative AIG publicity associated with the events of 2008 and 2009.

As SunAmerica operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, SunAmerica's DAC and VOBA may be subject to an impairment charge and its results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods. SunAmerica also conducts a review for recognition of losses assuming that the unrealized gains included in other comprehensive income are actually realized and the proceeds are reinvested at lower yields. Under these circumstances investment returns may not be sufficient to meet policy obligations. Due to significant unrealized investment appreciation resulting from the low interest rate environment, SunAmerica recognized a pre-tax adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income as a consequence of the recognition of additional policyholder benefit reserves of approximately $1.6 billion and a related reduction of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) of approximately $0.1 billion. The adjustment to policyholder benefit reserves assumes the unrealized appreciation on available-for-sale securities is actually realized and the proceeds are reinvested at lower yields.  141      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Aircraft Leasing Operations   AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC had an average of 934 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 943 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $1.5 billion compared to charges of $465 million in the same period in 2010.   ILFC performs an annual analysis of the recoverability of each individual aircraft in its fleet during the third quarter ("Assessment"). As part of this process, ILFC updates all critical and significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis, including projected lease rates and terms, residual values, overhaul rental realization and aircraft holding periods. Management uses its judgment when determining assumptions used in the recoverability analysis, taking into consideration historical data, current macro-economic and industry trends and conditions, and any changes in management's intent for any aircraft. In monitoring the aircraft in ILFC's fleet for impairment charges on an on-going basis, ILFC consider facts and circumstances, including potential sales and part-outs that would require it to modify its assumptions used in its recoverability assessments and prepare revised recoverability assessments as necessary.  142      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  In the Assessment performed during the third quarter of 2011, ILFC considered recent developments including:    •the impact of fuel price volatility and higher average fuel prices, resulting in fuel costs representing a higher percentage of airlines operating costs, which has affected airline strategies related to out-of-production aircraft;   •the growing impact of new technology aircraft (announcements, deliveries and order backlog) on current and future demand for mid-generation aircraft;   •the higher production rates sustained by manufacturers for more fuel efficient newer generation aircraft during the recent economic downturn;   •the unfavorable impact of low rates of inflation on aircraft values;   •current market conditions and future industry outlook for future marketing of older mid-generation and out-of-production aircraft; and   •decreasing number of lessees for older aircraft.    In addition to these factors, ILFC considered its newly acquired end-of-life management capabilities from its acquisition of AeroTurbine, which ILFC finalized on October 7, 2011, and its impact on ILFC's strategy. While ILFC's overall business model has not changed, its expectation of how it may manage out-of-production aircraft, or aircraft that have been affected by new technology developments, changed due to the AeroTurbine acquisition. The acquisition of AeroTurbine provides ILFC with increased choices in managing the end-of-life of aircraft in its fleet and makes the part-out of an aircraft a more economically and commercially viable option by bringing the requisite capabilities in-house and eliminating the payment of commissions to third parties. Parting-out aircraft will also enable ILFC to retain more cash flows from an aircraft during the last cycle of its life by allowing ILFC to eliminate certain maintenance costs and realize higher net overhaul revenues.   As part of the Assessment performed during the three months ended September 30, 2011, management performed a review of aircraft in its fleet that are currently out-of-production, or have been affected by new technology developments. The purpose of the review was to identify end-of-life options that are the most likely to occur on an individual aircraft basis in light of market conditions and the AeroTurbine acquisition. Most of the aircraft reviewed were in the second half of their estimated 25 year useful life. The current economic environment for these aircraft has been challenging and the outlook is expected to become more challenging due to the trends noted above. All of these factors contributed to management's conclusion that many of these aircraft would be disposed of prior to the end of their previously estimated useful life.   The result of the Assessment based on ILFC's updated assumptions and management's change in its end-of-life strategy for older generation aircraft indicated that the book value of 95 aircraft were not fully recoverable and these aircraft were deemed impaired as of September 30, 2011. The aircraft impaired were primarily out-of-production aircraft, or aircraft that have been impacted by new technology developments, included in the aforementioned review. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC recorded impairment charges of $1.5 billion on the 95 impaired aircraft and two additional aircraft that it deemed more likely than not to be sold.       Year-to-Date Aircraft Leasing Results   Aircraft Leasing pre-tax loss increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges recorded on aircraft, lower rental revenues as a result of a reduction in ILFC's average aircraft fleet size and lower lease rates on used aircraft. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, ILFC had an average of 933 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 968 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010. As described above, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, Aircraft Leasing recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $1.7 billion compared to charges of $962 million in the same period in 2010.  143      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Other Operations   The components of AIG's Other operations were revised in the third quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of the reclassification of non-aircraft leasing operations from the Financial Services reportable segment as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as follows:    •AIGFP's derivatives portfolio, previously reported as a component of the Financial Services reportable segment is now reported with AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) as Global Capital Markets in Other Operations.   •AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. operations and Institutional Asset Management, previously reported as components of Direct Investment book and Asset Management operations within Other operations, respectively, are now reported in Corporate & Other.    AIG's Other operations include the following:    •Mortgage Guaranty — UGC subsidiaries issue residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one-to four-family residences.   •Global Capital Markets — consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties, and executes its derivative trades (interest rate and foreign exchange swaps and forwards) under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of AIG Markets' transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties. The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis, although the portfolio may experience periodic mark-to-market volatility. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with the businesses of other AIG subsidiaries.   •Direct Investment book — includes results for the MIP and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP.   •Retained Interests — Fair value gains or losses on the MetLife securities that were received as consideration from the sale of ALICO prior to their sale in March 2011, AIG's remaining interest in AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering, and the retained interest in ML III.   •Corporate & Other — consists primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate-level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, the results of AIG's real estate investment operations, Institutional Asset Management operations, and net gains and losses on sales of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment.   •Divested Businesses — include results of certain businesses that have been divested that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations classification, primarily consisting of AIA in 2010.   144                     Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

Second-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses have declined primarily as a result of lower unfavorable development in the current period compared to the same period in 2010, a decline in newly reported delinquencies and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second lien policies. Claims and claims adjustment expenses for student loans declined primarily due to the commutation of the majority of the student loan portfolio during 2010. The higher first lien claims and claims adjustment expenses include provisions for increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims and unfavorable reserve development in the current period compared to favorable development experienced in the same period in 2010. The increased overturns reflect the additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. The unfavorable loss reserve development reflects higher claim frequency and severity, primarily due to delinquencies in Florida where property values have continued to decline combined with the slower pace of foreclosure activity due to the foreclosure moratorium in certain states. This slower foreclosure process has resulted in generally increasing the severity of individual claims; and   •a reduction in underwriting expenses reflecting a $30 million accrual of estimated remedy losses in 2010. Remedy losses represent the indemnification for losses incurred by lenders arising from obligations contractually assumed by UGC as a result of underwriting services provided to lenders during times of high loan origination activity. UGC believes it has adequately accrued for these losses at September 30, 2011.   145      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Partially offsetting these declines in expenses were declines in earned premiums from the second-lien, private student loan and international businesses resulting from these businesses being placed into runoff during the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by an increase in earned premiums from first-lien business.   UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties. These claims and counter-claims allege breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud, among other allegations. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, UGC accrued $22 million to pay for previously rescinded losses, certain legal fees and interest in connection with an adverse judgment. UGC has appealed the court's decision.   Year-to-Date Mortgage Guaranty Results   UGC recorded a pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to a pre-tax income in the same period in 2010, primarily due to:    •declines in earned premiums from the second-lien, private student loan and international businesses resulting from these businesses being placed into runoff during the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by an increase in earned premiums from first-lien business;   •an increase in claims and claims adjustment expenses for the first-lien and second-lien businesses, partially offset by declines for the student loan and international businesses. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses include provisions for increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims primarily in the first-lien business and unfavorable development experienced in 2011 compared to favorable reserve development experienced during the same period in 2010. The increased overturns result from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses were partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products and higher denials and rescissions, primarily on first-lien claims, and a reduction in reserves due to an agreement to resolve certain delinquencies with a major European lender that resulted in a $43 million benefit; and   •the accrual in response to the court judgment in 2011, discussed above.    Partially offsetting these declines was a reduction in underwriting expenses reflecting a $94 million accrual of estimated remedy losses in 2010 described above.

Global Capital Markets Operations   Quarterly Global Capital Markets Results   Global Capital Markets reported a pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to a pre-tax gain in the same period in 2010 primarily due to a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and a shift from a gain position in 2010 to a loss position in 2011 on the AIGFP credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits, which are not included in the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP recorded an unrealized market valuation gain on its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $3 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $152 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010. The decline in gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs and CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio driven by price decreases on the underlying assets (See Critical Accounting Estimates — Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio). During the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP recognized a loss of $19 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures as compared to a gain of $108 million in the same period in 2010.   Year-to-Date Global Capital Markets Results   Global Capital Markets reported a lower pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to improvements related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the credit valuation adjustments of AIGFP's derivative assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP recognized a net credit valuation adjustment loss on derivative assets and liabilities of $71 million compared to a net credit valuation loss of $379 million in the same period in 2010. The valuation improvement represents a narrowing of corporate spreads. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP recorded an unrealized market valuation gain on its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $232 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $432 million in the same period in 2010. The reduction in gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price declines of the underlying assets. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP recognized a loss of $28 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures as compared to a gain of $111 million in the same period in 2010.       Direct Investment Book Results   The Direct Investment book reported pre-tax income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2010, primarily due to gains on the credit valuation adjustment on the non-derivative liabilities accounted for under the fair value option which more than offset negative credit valuation adjustments on the non-derivative asset portfolio. This net gain was partially offset by lower interest income in the MIP on a lower asset base due to asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, the DIB pre-tax income decreased slightly due to lower net gains on credit valuation adjustments on non-derivative assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option, offset by significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities.  147      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities   AIG recognized a loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, representing a decline in the value of the AIA ordinary shares that offset almost the entire gain recognized on the shares during the strong equity markets in the first six months of 2011.       Change in Fair Value of ML III   The loss attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 was due to significant spread widening, reduced interest rates and changes in the timing of future estimated cash flows. The loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 was due to significant spread widening in the second and third quarters and reduced interest rates in the third quarter.       Corporate & Other   Corporate & Other reported a decline in pre-tax losses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to:    •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and   •net realized capital gains in 2011 compared to net realized capital losses in 2010, primarily due to the realized gains on Euro and British Pound denominated debt as a result of strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound in 2011 compared to U.S. dollar weakening in 2010.    These improvements were partially offset by severance expenses and asset write-offs relating to infrastructure consolidation initiatives and an increase in the provision for legal contingencies.   Corporate & Other reported a slight decline in pre-tax losses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to:    •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and   •a reduction in other corporate expenses due to the securities litigation charges recorded in 2010.    These improvements were mostly offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in connection with the Recapitalization, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility and net realized capital losses recorded in the first nine months of 2011 compared to net realized capital gains in the same period in 2010.       Divested Businesses   Divested businesses include the operating results of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting through the date of their sale as well as certain non-core businesses currently in run-off. The Divested businesses results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 primarily represent the historical results of AIA, which was deconsolidated in November 2010.  149      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.     Capital Resources and Liquidity       Overview   AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are short-term investments and borrowing availability under syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities. Subject to market conditions, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs, which include the payment of maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries.   Liquidity Adequacy Management   In 2010, AIG implemented a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess AIG's aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIG's existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two-year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks.   AIG's insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERM's stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation in order to determine AIG Parent's liquidity requirements to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required under stressed scenarios for non-insurance operations, including the AIGFP derivatives portfolio, the Direct Investment book and ILFC.   AIG's consolidated risk target is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer such that AIG Parent's liquidity requirements under the ERM stress scenarios do not exceed 80 percent of AIG Parent's overall liquidity sources over the specified two-year horizon. If the 80 percent minimum threshold is projected to be breached over this defined time horizon, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the target threshold, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions.   As a result of these ERM stress tests at September 30, 2011 and other considerations discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.   AIG has in place unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain domestic Chartis and SunAmerica insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. AIG expects to enter into additional CMAs with certain other Chartis insurance companies as needed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in 2012. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Chartis, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — SunAmerica below.  150      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash   The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                         Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)   2011   2010            Summary:                    Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities    $ (1,083 )  $ 15,115        Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities      36,028      (7,527 )      Net cash used in financing activities      (35,444 )    (8,772 )      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      37      (4 )          Decrease in cash      (462 )    (1,188 )    Cash at beginning of year      1,558      4,400      Change in cash of businesses held for sale      446      (1,544 )          Cash at end of period    $ 1,542    $ 1,668              Net cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2011 reflects:    •the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued compounded interest and fees by AIG Parent totaling $6.4 billion, which were previously paid in-kind, and accordingly did not reduce operating cash flows in prior periods;   •a $6.5 billion reduction in cash provided by operating activities attributable to foreign life subsidiaries that were sold (e.g., AIA, ALICO, AIG Star and AIG Edison), which generated $3.4 billion in inflows through the first nine months of 2011 and $9.9 billion in cash inflows for the same period in 2010; and   •the effect of catastrophes and the cession of the bulk of Chartis net asbestos liabilities in the United States to NICO. Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits, but the ability of Chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Excluding the impact of the NICO cession and catastrophes, cash provided by AIG's reportable segments for the first nine months of 2011 is consistent with the same period of 2010, as increases in claims paid were offset by increases in premiums collected at the insurance organizations.    The significant increase in cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of 2011 was primarily attributable to:    •the utilization of $26.4 billion of restricted cash generated from the AIA IPO and ALICO sale in connection with the Recapitalization and $9.6 billion disposition of MetLife securities, described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements;   •the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan in 2011 for total proceeds of $6.4 billion; and   •net sales of short term investments and maturities of available for sale investments, primarily at Chartis and SunAmerica, which were partially offset by purchases of available for sale investments.    Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities, resulting from AIG's investment of cash generated from operating activities, and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in 2008 and 2009.   Net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2011 primarily represents the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $11.4 billion partial repayment of the SPV Preferred Interests in connection with the Recapitalization described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and use of proceeds received from the sales of foreign life insurance entities in 2011.  151                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.       Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries       AIG Parent   The Recapitalization in January 2011 involved a series of integrated transactions which directly impacted AIG Parent's liquidity activities and position. These transactions included the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the repurchase and exchange of the SPV Preferred Interests. These transactions are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are excluded from the Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Liquidity discussions below.   In addition, in the first nine months of 2011, several significant asset sales were completed, including the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison in February 2011, the sale of MetLife securities in March 2011, and the sale of Nan Shan in August 2011. Proceeds from these sales primarily were used to pay down the Department of Treasury's SPV Interests. These transactions are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are excluded from the Sources and Uses discussion below.   In May 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. A portion of the net proceeds AIG received from this offering, $550 million, is being used to fund a litigation settlement, and AIG intends to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.   On September 13, 2011, AIG received approximately $2.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. AIG expects to use the proceeds from the sale of these notes to pay maturing notes that were issued by AIG to fund the MIP.   Sources of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary sources of cash flow are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. In the first nine months of 2011, AIG Parent collected $2.2 billion in payments from subsidiaries, including $905 million in dividends from Chartis and repayment of intercompany loans of $1.1 billion from the SunAmerica companies. AIG also raised approximately $2.9 billion in net proceeds from the sale of AIG Common Stock and also raised approximately $2.0 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes; these items are discussed under Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — AIG Parent above.   AIG has established and maintains substantial sources of actual and contingent liquidity.       The following table presents AIG Parent's sources of liquidity. This does not include liquidity that is expected to result from cash flows from operations:                       (in millions)   As of September 30, 2011            Cash(a)    $ 165      Short-term investments(b)      11,468      Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities      3,182      Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facility      500            Total AIG Parent liquidity sources    $ 15,315               (a) Excludes Cash and Short-term Investments held by AIGFP which are considered to be unrestricted and available for use by AIG Parent of $187 million at September 30, 2011. (b)Includes reverse repurchase agreements totaling $8.7 billion used to reduce unsecured exposures.  152      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  AIG's ability to borrow under the syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings. For further discussion of the terms and conditions relating to the bank credit facilities, see Credit Facilities below.   In October 2011, AIG entered into an additional contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the right, for a period of one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIG's discretion.   For additional information on the existing contingent liquidity facility, see Debt below.   Uses of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In the first nine months of 2011, AIG Parent retired $4.4 billion of debt, including $2.2 billion of MIP obligations, and made interest payments totaling $1.7 billion. Approximately $5.4 billion of AIG Parent's cash and short-term investments balance is attributable to the MIP and is available to meet obligations of the DIB. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Other Operations — Direct Investment Book below for additional details.   AIG Parent made $3.8 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the first nine months of 2011, of which $3.7 billion was contributed to Chartis in response to the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. This transaction was funded from the retention of $2 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison (for which the Department of the Treasury provided a waiver permitting AIG to use such proceeds for this purpose instead of using the proceeds to pay down SPV Preferred Interests) and available cash at AIG Parent.   AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. No assurance can be given, however, that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected liquidity. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.       Chartis   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Chartis subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $9.0 billion as of September 30, 2011. Further, Chartis businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which Chartis could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient.   In the first quarter of 2011, Chartis received a capital contribution of $3.7 billion in cash from AIG Parent following the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. Chartis used $1.8 billion of this amount to purchase certain assets from the DIB. Chartis subsequently returned capital of $2.2 billion to AIG Parent in the form of all of the outstanding stock of UGC in the first quarter of 2011. In the first nine months of 2011, Chartis paid dividends of $905 million to AIG Parent.   One or more large catastrophes may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected Chartis operations. In addition, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the relevant subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations, and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of Chartis  153      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Chartis operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.   In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) guidelines). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs (as reflected in the companies' quarterly or annual statutory financial statements), subject to board and regulatory approval(s), the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage.   Chartis continues to identify cost effective opportunities to manage its capital allocation through the use of intercompany reinsurance.   During September 2011, a $725 million letter of credit facility was put in place, under which Chartis and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) acted as co-obligors. ACNL, a Chartis subsidiary and member of the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd's), is required to provide capital to Lloyd's, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2012 and 2013 years of account, the entire FAL requirement will be satisfied with a letter of credit in substitution for $552 million of FAL previously contributed through a $400 million letter of credit and $152 million in the form of cash and securities.       SunAmerica   Management considers the sources of liquidity for SunAmerica subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. The SunAmerica companies continue to maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $3.8 billion as of September 30, 2011. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed maturity securities in order to reduce the levels of cash, cash equivalents and other short-term instruments that had been maintained during 2009 and 2010. In the first nine months of 2011, the SunAmerica life insurance companies paid dividends and surplus note interest totaling approximately $1.7 billion to their respective holding companies, of which $1.1 billion was used to provide liquidity to AIG Parent through the repayment of intercompany loans.   The most significant potential liquidity requirements of the SunAmerica companies are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of SunAmerica's investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk. As part of SunAmerica's risk management framework, it is evaluating and will deploy programs to enhance its liquidity position and facilitate SunAmerica's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Such programs may include securities lending programs structured to increase liquidity and membership in Federal Home Loan Banks. Securities lending programs may be beneficial from a tax perspective as well.   In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain SunAmerica insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected company action level RBCs (as defined by NAIC guidelines). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs (as reflected in the companies' quarterly or annual statutory financial statements), subject to board and regulatory approval(s), the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage.  154      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       Aircraft Leasing   On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding terms or that an offering will be completed. All proceeds from any offering will go to the selling shareholder and are required to be used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.   ILFC's sources of liquidity include existing cash and short-term investments of $882 million, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments. In 2011, ILFC improved its liquidity position by entering into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility and a secured $1.5 billion term loan facility. In addition, on May 24, 2011, ILFC issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with $1.0 billion maturing in 2016 and $1.25 billion maturing in 2019. On June 17, 2011, ILFC completed tender offers for the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with maturity dates in 2012 and 2013 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of 2011.   See Debt — Debt Maturities — ILFC for further details on ILFC's outstanding debt.       Other Operations   Mortgage Guaranty   AIG currently expects that its UGC subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. UGC subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2011. Further, UGC businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds ($3.0 billion in the aggregate at September 30, 2011), which UGC could monetize in the event liquidity levels are insufficient.   Global Capital Markets   AIG Markets   AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties and executes its derivative trades (interest rate and foreign exchange swaps and forwards) under ISDA agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of AIG Markets' transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties. Cash collateral posted by AIG Markets to third parties was $206 million and $2 million at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Cash collateral obtained by AIG Markets from third parties was $682 million and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.   AIGFP   AIGFP continues to rely upon AIG Parent to meet most of its collateral and other liquidity requirements in connection with its remaining derivatives portfolio.  155      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP:                                (in millions)   Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2010   Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty   Collateral Returned by Counterparties   Collateral Posted as of September 30, 2011            Super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio   $ 3,786   $ 375   $ 969    $ 3,192      All other derivatives     1,335     1,600     815      2,120            Total   $ 5,121   $ 1,975   $ 1,784    $ 5,312              Collateral obtained by AIGFP from third parties was $590 million and $2.3 billion at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.       The following table presents the net notional amount and number of outstanding trade positions in AIGFP's portfolios:                             (dollars in billions)   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010   Percentage Decrease            Net notional amount(a)    $ 190    $ 341      (44 )%    Super senior CDS contracts (included in net notional amount above)      26      60      (57 )    Outstanding trade positions(b)      2,100      3,900      (46 )             (a) Excludes $12.6 billion and $11.5 billion of intercompany derivatives at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (b)Excludes approximately 4,800 non-derivative trade positions that were transferred to Direct Investment book in 2010.   The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis, although the portfolio may experience periodic mark-to-market volatility.   Direct Investment Book   AIG's existing CDS contracts for the MIP under ISDA agreements may require collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels.   While a significant portion of the DIB's liquidity requirements are supported by existing liquidity sources or maturing investments, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows may require assets to be sold to satisfy liquidity requirements. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets if required, proceeds from asset sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount required. Management believes that sufficient liquidity is maintained by the DIB to meet near-term liquidity requirements. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. The amount of collateral posted by the DIB for collateralized guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $5.2 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.   During the first nine months of 2011, $1.8 billion of assets held by the DIB were sold to certain Chartis subsidiaries. In addition, during the first nine months of 2011, AIG assigned approximately 52 percent of AIG's interest in ML III to the DIB, subject to liens on those interests as set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement dated December 8, 2010, among AIG Parent, AM Holdings LLC (formerly known as ALICO Holdings LLC), AIA Aurora LLC, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury, and the Trust.   In the third quarter of 2011, AIG issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, $1.2 billion of 4.250% Notes Due 2014 and $800 million of 4.875% Notes Due 2016. The proceeds from the sale of these notes are expected to be used to pay maturing MIP debt and the notes are included within "MIP notes payable" in the debt outstanding table below.  156      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Debt       Debt Maturities       The following table summarizes maturing debt at September 30, 2011 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                   (in millions)   Fourth Quarter 2011   First Quarter 2012   Second Quarter 2012   Third Quarter 2012   Total            ILFC   $ 174   $ 1,052   $ 594   $ 774   $ 2,594      Borrowings supported by assets (DIB)     1,476     1,363     1,997     211     5,047      General borrowings     649     27     -     -     676      Other     1     1     1     1     4            Total   $ 2,300   $ 2,443   $ 2,592   $ 986   $ 8,321              AIG's plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows:    •ILFC's sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash and short-term investments of $882 million, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Aircraft Leasing. Additionally, at September 30, 2011, ILFC had $2.0 billion available under its unsecured three-year revolving credit facility and $334 million available under its secured $1.5 billion term loan facility. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations.   •AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt included in the DIB. At September 30, 2011, all of the debt maturities in the DIB through September 30, 2012 are supported by short-term investments and maturities of investments. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.   157      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

(c) Reflects future minimum payment for ILFC's borrowings under the 2004 Export Credit Agency (ECA) Facility.       Credit Facilities   AIG relies on credit facilities as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Currently, AIG and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities, including a facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit, summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes and for letter of credit issuance. AIG intends to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. One of the facilities, as noted below, contains a "term-out option" allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. All facilities, except for the ILFC five-year syndicated credit facility maturing October 2012, are unsecured.

On October 12, 2011, the previously outstanding AIG 364-Day Syndicated Facility, AIG 3-Year Syndicated Facility and Chartis letter of credit facility were terminated upon AIG entering into a $1.5 billion 364-Day Syndicated Facility and a $3.0 billion 4-Year Syndicated Facility. The new 4-Year Syndicated Facility provides for $1.5 billion of revolving loans and includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. The $1.3 billion of previously issued letters of credit under the Chartis letter of credit facility were rolled into the letter of credit sublimit within the 4-Year Syndicated Facility, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on these facilities from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.   AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, including covenants relating to AIG's maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth, total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization and total priority debt (defined as debt of AIG's subsidiaries and secured debt of AIG) to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict AIG's access to the facilities and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIG's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   ILFC's three-year credit facility which became effective January 31, 2011 contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that require ILFC to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a maximum ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth. Prior to April 16, 2010, ILFC had a $2.5 billion five-year syndicated facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. On April 16, 2010, ILFC amended and extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Upon effectiveness of these amendments, the previously unsecured bank debt became secured by the equity interest in certain of ILFC's non-restricted subsidiaries, which hold a pool of aircraft with an appraised value of not less than 133 percent of the principal amount of the outstanding loans. During 2010 and the first three quarters of 2011, ILFC paid down $1.97 billion on the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. In October 2011, ILFC paid off the non-extended portion of the facility in the amount of $73 million, bringing the revolving credit facility size down to $457 million. The amended facility prohibits ILFC from re-borrowing amounts repaid under this facility for any reason; therefore, the size of the outstanding revolving credit facility is $457 million.       Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short- and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of October 28, 2011. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.    These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of the GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings or, with the consent of the counterparties, assignment or repayment of the positions or arrangement of a substitute guarantee of AIG's obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of AIG's insurance companies or AIG's credit ratings, see Part II, Item 1A.

(b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.5 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of AIGFP's credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At September 30, 2011, the fair value derivative liability was $3.1 billion, relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at September 30, 2011 AIGFP had posted collateral of $2.7 billion with respect to these swaps.  161                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.

The commitments to invest in limited partnerships and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (d)Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans.

Securities Financing    The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.       Dividend Restrictions    See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG subsidiaries.       Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities    While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  162      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.      Investments       Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the Direct Investment book, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration. Domestically, fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Chartis historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of Chartis, the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Chartis companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At September 30, 2011, approximately 88 percent of the fixed maturity securities were held by domestic entities. Approximately 24 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 12 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2011, approximately 29 percent of the foreign fixed maturity investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 3 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 40 percent of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  163      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.       Investment Highlights   The third quarter of 2011 gave rise to elevated levels of volatility in the capital markets both domestically and globally. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries dropped to historic lows, commodities declined from their previous highs, and equity markets experienced their worst performance since the first quarter of 2009. As a result, AIG experienced significantly lower net investment income in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.   An overview of noteworthy investment activities during the third quarter of 2011 is provided below:    •purchased approximately $23 billion of fixed maturity securities during the quarter (approximately $71 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2011) by insurance operations. The purchases were made using proceeds from sales and maturity of securities, paydowns on structured securities, cash flow from operations and investments, and from the redeployment of existing cash and short-term investments. Short-term investments were redeployed into approximately $19 billion of higher yielding fixed maturity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2011.   •corporate debt (primarily high grade) represented approximately 75 percent of new purchases. Risk-weighted opportunistic investments in structured securities continued to be made to improve yields and increase net investment income, but the amount of such purchases was significantly less than in the second quarter of 2011;   •base yields at Chartis and SunAmerica continued to improve as a result of cash deployment activities, but the low rate environment continues to put downward pressure on yields as new money rates are generally lower than maturing or called investment yields;   •continued reductions of the tax exempt municipal bond portfolio exposure of $1.7 billion and $9.8 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively, primarily from sales, although sales levels were lower in the third quarter than in the first two quarters in 2011;   •partnership income was at its lowest level since the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by poor equity market performance. Hedge fund losses were more than offset by positive private equity returns;   •continuation of decreases in fair value on the Maiden Lane Interests due to widening spread trends and negative changes in future cash flow projections. The combined third quarter 2011 fair value loss of $1.0 billion compares unfavorably to the second quarter 2011 and the third quarter 2010 by $0.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively;   •a decline in the value of AIA ordinary shares of $2.3 billion that offset the majority of the $2.6 billion gain recorded for the first six months of the year;   •$2.2 billion net unrealized appreciation in AIG's invested assets in the quarter driven by lower yields across its U.S. government, municipal bonds, agency structured securities, and non-financial corporate debt investments, partially offset by unrealized losses in non agencies, financial corporate debt instruments, and equities;   •$620 million of net realized capital gains on sales of fixed maturity securities and equities in the third quarter of 2011, a seven percent decline compared to the $669 million of gains in the second quarter of 2011 and a 36 percent decline compared to the $974 million of gains in the third quarter of 2010. The current quarter gains consist primarily of realized gains on the sale of corporate debt instruments, with additional contributions from the continuing tax-exempt municipal bond sales strategy;   •other-than-temporary impairments of $496 million in the third quarter of 2011, with the majority related to structured securities. This was the first quarterly increase in other-than-temporary impairments experienced in 2011;   164      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.   •realized capital losses of approximately $334 million on the unhedged interest rate component contained in certain annuity and life contracts. The realized capital losses were driven by the significant decrease in interest rates in the third quarter of 2011; and   •U.S. Dollar strengthening against the British Pound and Euro resulted in realized capital gains of $260 million on AIG's unhedged foreign-denominated debt in the third quarter of 2011.    The credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect (a) the ratings on AIG's fixed maturity investments at September 30, 2011 by one or more of the major rating agencies or by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) AIG's equivalent internal ratings where the investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity investments that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or AIG, and represents primarily AIG's interest in ML III.

Although the market value of CMBS holdings has remained stable during the first nine months of 2011, the portfolio continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings.

Notwithstanding AIG's intent and ability to hold its securities which suffered severity losses until they had recovered their cost or amortized cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.   Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.   AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 related to:    •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments, private equity investments and investments in life settlement contracts.    With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.07 percent and 0.10 percent of Total equity in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $141 million and $94 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $355 million and $315 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(d) The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC.  (e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.    For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $5.2 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of September 30, 2011, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for more than 12 months consisted of the unrealized loss of $444 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 55 securities with an amortized cost of $369 million and a net unrealized loss of $198 million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate-related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive.   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe  179      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.   See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of AIG's investment portfolio.      Enterprise Risk Management    For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Credit Risk Management   AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark-to-market and potential future exposure), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties, commercial bank letters of credit received as collateral, guarantees, and the specified credit equivalent exposures to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. Therefore, AIG's reported credit exposures to a counterparty reflect available for sale and held-to-maturity investments, trading securities, derivative exposures, insurance credit and any other counterparty credit exposures.   AIG's single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 36 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2011 compared to 22 percent at December 31, 2010. The increase reflects the effects of the Recapitalization on Total equity as well as increased exposure to the U.S. Government, including primarily credit exposure to the U.S. Treasury and its agencies and to the direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at September 30, 2011, AIG's largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure was 0.5 percent of Total equity, compared to 0.6 percent at December 31, 2010.   AIG's single largest industry credit exposure was to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies. As of September 30, 2011, credit exposure to this sector was $105 billion, or 121 percent of Total equity compared to 119 percent at December 31, 2010. At September 30, 2011, $100 billion or 95 percent of these financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings and $5 billion or 5 percent non-investment grade. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade financial institutions was $2 billion at September 30, 2011.   Of this $105 billion of credit exposure to the financial institution sector, AIG's aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $41 billion. Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repos, repos and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $21 billion of the total exposure, or 20 percent, to global financial institutions at September 30, 2011. The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, ordinary shares of AIA, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, and captive risk management exposure.  180                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   Among AIG's financial institution exposures, aggregate credit exposures to United Kingdom- and European-based banks totaled $27.9 billion at September 30, 2011, of which $27.3 billion were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade-rated credit exposures to European banks were $552 million at September 30, 2011.   AIG's credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $11.7 billion, of which $5.8 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the five countries of the Euro-Zone periphery totaled $2 billion, of which $1.2 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $2.2 billion, of which $933 million were fixed maturity securities. AIG's credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.  The following table presents AIG's aggregate credit exposures to banks in the United Kingdom and Europe:                               September 30, 2011   (in millions)   Fixed Maturity Securities(a)   Cash and Short-Term Investments(b)   Other(c)   Total            Euro-zone countries:                                Netherlands   $ 2,202   $ 818   $ 930   $ 3,950        Germany     957     708     1,000     2,665        France     933     507     791     2,231        Spain     779     190     126     1,095        Italy     293     67     341     701        Belgium     228     1     164     393        Ireland     137     58     30     225        Greece     -     1     -     1        Portugal     -     -     -     -        Other Euro-zone     226     213     5     444            Total Euro-zone   $ 5,755   $ 2,563   $ 3,387   $ 11,705            Remainder of Europe                                United Kingdom   $ 4,607   $ 2,383   $ 2,580   $ 9,570        Switzerland     1,053     921     597     2,571        Sweden     722     1,306     50     2,078        Other remainder of Europe     508     1,420     41     1,969            Total remainder of Europe   $ 6,890   $ 6,030   $ 3,268   $ 16,188            Total   $ 12,645   $ 8,593   $ 6,655   $ 27,893               (a) Fixed maturity securities primarily includes available for sale and trading securities reported at fair value and single name CDS at notional contract amounts.

(c)Other primarily consists of commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures ($1.7 billion), captive programs in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands ($1.8 billion) and derivative transactions at fair value ($1.3 billion).   Out of a total of $5.8 billion of fixed maturity securities of banks in the Euro-Zone countries, AIG's subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $1.5 billion and $612 million, respectively, at September 30, 2011. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.  181      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

(b)Secured/government primarily includes covered bonds and securities issued by government-sponsored entities or debt guaranteed by a government.   AIG also had credit exposures to several European governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in recent months by one or more of the major rating agencies. These downgrades occurred mostly in countries in the European periphery (Spain, Italy and Portugal) where AIG's credit exposures totaled $415 million at September 30, 2011. The downgrades primarily reflect the large government budget deficits and rising government debt-to-GDP ratios of these sovereigns. These credit exposures primarily included available for sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. AIG had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece or Ireland.  182      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

AIG believes that its combined credit risk exposures to sovereign governments and financial institutions in the Euro-zone are manageable risks given the type of exposure and the quality and size of the issuers.   AIG also monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Ten countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2011 compared to eight such countries in December 31, 2010. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at September 30, 2011, six countries were rated AAA, two were rated AA, and two were rated A. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.   AIG also has a risk concentration, primarily through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies, in the U.S. municipal sector. A majority of these securities were held in available for sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property casualty insurance companies. AIG had $881 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios at September 30, 2011, compared to $974 million at December 31, 2010. These exposures consisted of AIGFP derivatives and trading securities (at fair value) and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.

AIG's Credit Risk Management Department reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. AIG Credit Risk Management periodically adjusts limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.  Market Risk Management   Insurance and Aircraft Leasing Sensitivities  The following table provides estimates of AIG's sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                    Exposure        Effect      (dollars in millions)   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010*   Sensitivity Factor   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Yield sensitive assets    $ 331,300    $ 308,900    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves    $ (15,200 )  $ (13,400 )    Equity and alternative investments exposure    $ 39,000    $ 46,400    20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments    $ (7,800 )  $ (9,300 )    Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure    $ 5,300    $ 3,400    10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar    $ (530 )  $ (340 )             * All figures and periods have been adjusted to reflect the divestitures of AIG Star, AIG Edison, and Nan Shan, which occurred in 2011.   Exposures for yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short-term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures for equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIG's consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis.   •Total yield sensitive assets increased 7.3 percent or $22.4 billion at September 30, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in fixed income assets of $33.9 billion. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and other assets of $11.5 billion.   •Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 16.0 percent or $7.4 billion compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to: AIG's sale of MetLife equity securities ($6.5 billion); a decrease in mutual fund value ($1.3 billion); a decrease in common equity securities ($1.4 billion); and a decrease in real estate investment ($0.3 billion). The decrease was partially offset by an increase in partnership value ($1.0 billion) and an increase in all other equity investments ($1.1 billion).   •The 55.9 percent or $1.89 billion increase in foreign currency exchange rates net exposure at September 30, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010, includes: $944 million from certain foreign-denominated equity holdings; goodwill translation adjustment of $832 million; and a change in all other currencies of $119 million.   The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors are the same as those used in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  184      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.     Critical Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:   •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax asset;   •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and flight equipment;   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including CDS and AIG's economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III;   •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;   •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments; and   •liabilities for legal contingencies;   These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. Following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2011. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, see AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset:   The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.   AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets weighs the sustainability of recent operating profitability, the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, and its emergence from cumulative losses in recent years. The framework requires AIG to consider all available evidence, including:   •the sustainability of recent operating profitability of the AIG subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions;   •the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets;   •the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses in recent years;   •the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards;   •the recognition of the gains and losses on business dispositions;   •prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax assets; and   •the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences.  185      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  AIG has had several favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios, the sale of certain businesses, and its emergence from cumulative losses in recent years. AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group, however, still needs to demonstrate sustainable operating profit. Based on the results of the third quarter of 2011, AIG's level of profitability in the fourth quarter of 2011 will be very important in demonstrating sustainable operating profit. AIG's ability to demonstrate sustainable operating profit, together with the recent emergence from cumulative losses as well as projections of sufficient future taxable income, would represent significant positive evidence. Depending on AIG's level of profitability and the characteristics of the deferred tax assets, it is possible that the valuation allowance could be released in large part in the fourth quarter of 2011, which would materially and favorably affect Net income and shareholders' equity in that period. At December 31, 2010, the valuation allowance for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group was $23.8 billion.       Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs - Short Duration (general insurance):   Recoverability of DAC is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses and maintenance costs, unamortized DAC and anticipated maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Investment income is not anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded unearned premiums of its Chartis domestic and international operations exceeded the sum of these costs at September 30, 2011, by one percent and 20 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the DAC of these operations was considered to be recoverable. DAC for Chartis domestic and international operations amounted to $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2011. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Goodwill:   Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred.   The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.   Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG's reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit's fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit's peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test.   If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair  186      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess.   During the third quarter of 2011, Chartis finalized its reorganization, operating design and related segment reporting changes. In connection with this reorganization, total goodwill of $1.4 billion was allocated between Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on their relative fair values as of September 30, 2011. Management tested the allocated goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair values of the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reporting units exceeded book value at September 30, 2011 and therefore the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired.   AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances, including Chartis operating results that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.       Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:   Overview  The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                        September 30, 2011 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 260      90 %    Fair value based on internal sources     28     10            Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 288      100 %             (a) Includes $22.5 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.    See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policies for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.   Level 3 Assets and Liabilities   Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability.   At September 30, 2011, AIG classified $39.9 billion and $6.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 7.3 percent and 1.4 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at September 30, 2011. At December 31, 2010, AIG classified $36.3 billion and $6.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 5.3 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.   AIGFP's Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior  187      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class:                                                               Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss)                  Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at          Net Notional Amount    Three Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,          September 30, 2011(a)   December 31, 2010(a)   September 30, 2011(b)(c)   December 31, 2010(b)(c)     (in millions)   2011(c)   2010(c)   2011(c)   2010(c)            Regulatory Capital:                                                        Corporate loans    $ 2,275    $ 5,193    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -        Prime residential mortgages(d)      4,355      31,613      -      (190 )    -      45      6      71        Other      984      1,263      17      17      (10 )    6      -      (1 )            Total      7,614      38,069      17      (173 )    (10 )    51      6      70            Arbitrage:                                                        Multi-sector CDOs(e)      5,667      6,689      3,106      3,484      47      117      230      516        Corporate debt/CLOs(f)      12,035      12,269      160      171      (33 )    8      11      (82 )            Total      17,702      18,958      3,266      3,655      14      125      241      434            Mezzanine tranches(d)(g)      726      2,823      (12 )    198      (1 )    (24 )    (15 )    (72 )          Total    $ 26,042    $ 59,850    $ 3,271    $ 3,680    $ 3    $ 152    $ 232    $ 432               (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

(d)During the second quarter of 2011, AIGFP terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions, with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion at March 31, 2011, that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute. In addition, AIGFP terminated the vast majority of the related mezzanine tranches and the majority of the hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. The transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair values at the time of termination and, as a result, unrealized gains and losses were realized at termination. (e)During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP liquidated one multi-sector super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $188 million. The primary underlying collateral components, which consisted of individual ABS CDS transactions, were sold in an auction to counterparties, including AIGFP, at their approximate fair value at the time of the liquidation. AIGFP was the winning bidder on approximately $107 million of individual ABS CDS transactions, which are reported in written single name credit default swaps as of September 30, 2011. As a result, a $121 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, AIGFP also paid $27 million to its counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, a $27 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Multi-sector CDOs also include $4.8 billion and $5.5 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (f)Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.3 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. (g)Net of offsetting purchased CDS of $272 million and $1.4 billion in net notional amount at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  188      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

Regulatory Capital Portfolio    During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, $26.0 billion in net notional amount of regulatory capital CDSs were terminated or matured at no cost to AIGFP. AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of September 30, 2011, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 0.99 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. However, during the second quarter of 2011, AIGFP terminated mezzanine tranches related to certain terminated super senior regulatory capital trades and made payments which approximated their fair values at the time of termination. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties was generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio decreased as of September 30, 2011 by approximately 2.2 years from December 31, 2010 due to the termination of two transactions that had a longer than average weighted average maturity. Because the remaining counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the relevant rules under Basel I will remain effective. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under Basel I rules and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions.   During the second quarter of 2011, AIGFP terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions, with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion at March 31, 2011, that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute. In addition, AIGFP terminated the vast majority of the related mezzanine tranches and the majority of the hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. These transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair value at the time of termination.   During the third quarter of 2011, hedge transactions with a net notional amount of $427 million were terminated at values that approximated their fair value at the time of termination. The terminations had a positive net cash flow effect on AIG due to the return of previously posted collateral.   In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.  190      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.

(c)Delinquency information is not provided to AIGFP for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of this transaction. However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to AIGFP for such referenced pools.  191                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.   All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in all corporate loan and residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. All of the remaining corporate loan transactions are written on Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances, which tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. One pool containing the highest percentage of non-investment grade obligations, which is the only transaction with a pool of non-investment grade percentages greater than 45 percent, is comprised solely of granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The number of loans in this pool is 5,701. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. This transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at September 30, 2011. Two other pools, with a total net notional amount of $654 million, have non-investment grade percentages less than 45 percent, with a weighted average remaining life to maturity of 3.2 years. These pools have weighted average realized losses of 0.29 percent from inception through September 30, 2011 and have current weighted average attachment points of 33.69 percent. Approximately 5.73 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 3.63 percent to 16.38 percent.  192      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.   Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on 82.22 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.19 percent to 2.20 percent, averaging 0.44 percent. Except for one transaction, which comprised less than 5.00 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.95 percent and the default rates ranged from 0.00 percent to 6.53 percent. The default rate on this one transaction was 23.10 percent with a subordination level of 63.63 percent.   For all regulatory capital transactions, where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIGFP monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers and information available from rating agencies, governments and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will continue to terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.

Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

(b)Represents defaults (assets that are technically defaulted but for which the losses have not yet been realized) from inception through September 30, 2011 expressed as a percentage of the gross transaction notional amount at September 30, 2011.       Collateral    Most of the AIGFP credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.       Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of September 30, 2011, 76.1 percent of the AIGFP regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to CSAs linked to AIG's credit rating and 23.9 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone Master Agreement or similar agreement, under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.  Expected Loss Models — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.   197      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  Negotiated Amount — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   The following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than the AIGFP super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended:                        (in millions)   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Reference to market indices    $ 23    $ 19      Expected loss models      3      -      Negotiated amount      -      217            Total    $ 26    $ 236                    Arbitrage Portfolio — Multi-Sector CDOs   In the CDS transactions with physical settlement provisions, in respect of multi-sector CDOs, the standard CSA provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified, with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying CDO security, rather than the replacement value of the transaction. As of any date, the "market value" of the relevant CDO security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such CDO security in a market transaction on such date, while the "replacement value of the transaction" is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation (e.g., the CDO security). In cases where a formula is utilized, a transaction-specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure, which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted. These thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of AIG and/or the reference obligations, with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings. For the large majority of counterparties to these transactions, the Master Agreement and CSA cover non-CDS transactions (e.g., interest rate and cross currency swap transactions) as well as CDS transactions. As a result, the amount of collateral to be posted by AIGFP in relation to the CDS transactions will be added to or offset by the amount, if any, of the exposure AIG has to the counterparty on the non-CDS transactions.       Arbitrage Portfolio — Corporate Debt/CLOs   All of the AIGFP corporate arbitrage-CLO transactions are subject to CSAs. These transactions are treated the same way as other transactions subject to the same Master Agreement and CSA, with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard CSA procedures outlined above.   The vast majority of corporate debt transactions, and all such transactions maturing after 2011, are no longer subject to future collateral postings. In exchange for an upfront payment to an intermediary counterparty, AIGFP has eliminated all future obligations to post collateral on corporate debt transactions that mature after 2011.       Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.   From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFP's estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to  198      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                        (in millions)   September 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Regulatory capital    $ 26    $ 236      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO      2,667      3,013      Arbitrage – corporate      499      537            Total    $ 3,192    $ 3,786              The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. AIGFP estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with its super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into AIG's liquidity planning assumptions.       Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio       Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs decreased during 2011. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $5.7 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at September 30, 2011, a BET value is available for $3.6 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $2.1 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $3.6 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market  199      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc.  conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at September 30, 2011 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                             Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at September 30, 2011         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS Prime   RMBS Alt-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     32 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (246 ) $ (6 ) $ (18 ) $ (99 ) $ (89 ) $ (23 ) $ (11 )                Decrease of 5 points     234     6     18     96     84     15     15            Weighted         Increase of 1 year     26     -     1     21     3     1     -        average life     6.65 years   Decrease of 1 year     (56 )   (1 )   (1 )   (42 )   (8 )   (3 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     15%   Increase of 10%     (33 )   -     (4 )   (14 )   (12 )   (1 )   (2 )                Decrease of 10%     23     -     3     14     5     1     -            Diversity score(a)     12   Increase of 5     (6 )                                                 Decrease of 5     18                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     19                                                   (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2011, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.   There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  201                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc.
