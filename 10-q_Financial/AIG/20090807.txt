Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.       AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projection or other statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     In addition to reviewing AIG’s results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of AIG for the year ended December 31, 2008 (including the Form 10-K/A (Amendment No. 1) filed on April 30, 2009) (the 2008 Form 10-K) and the revised financial information reflecting the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51” (FAS 160), included in AIG’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 29, 2009 (such revised financial information and the financial statements included in the 2008 Form 10-K, collectively, the 2008 Financial Statements), to reflect developments in or affecting AIG’s business to date during 2009. Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Statutory underwriting profit (loss) is presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. AIG also uses cross-references to additional information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the 2008 Form 10-K to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject.      Overview      Operations     AIG identifies its operating segments by product line, consistent with its management structure. These segments are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions.     AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG’s Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals.     Consideration of AIG’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern     In the 2008 Form 10-K, management disclosed the conditions and events that led management to conclude that AIG would have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG’s businesses, execute its asset disposition plan and repay its obligations for at least the next twelve months. At that time, the United States government issued the following statement referring to the March 2009 agreements in principle and other transactions they expected to    89    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     undertake with AIG (many of which were subsequently undertaken) to strengthen its capital position, enhance its liquidity, reduce its borrowing costs and facilitate AIG’s asset disposition program.     “The steps announced today provide tangible evidence of the U.S. government’s commitment to the orderly restructuring of AIG over time in the face of continuing market dislocations and economic deterioration. Orderly restructuring is essential to AIG’s repayment of the support it has received from U.S. taxpayers and to preserving financial stability. The U.S. government is committed to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due.”     In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management assessed whether AIG had the ability to continue as a going concern. In making this assessment, AIG considered:              •   The commitment of the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury to the orderly restructuring of AIG and their commitment to continuing to work with AIG to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due;         •   AIG’s liquidity-related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the facility (the FRBNY Facility) provided by the FRBNY under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Agreement), between AIG and the FRBNY;         •   The level of AIG’s realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders’ equity and on the capital levels of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries;         •   The substantial resolution of the liquidity issues surrounding the multi-sector super senior credit default swap portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) and the U.S. securities lending program;         •   The additional capital provided to AIG by the Department of the Treasury;         •   The proposed transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2009, between AIG, American International Reinsurance Company, Limited (AIRCO) and the FRBNY (the AIA Purchase Agreement) and the Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2009, between AIG and the FRBNY (the ALICO Purchase Agreement);         •   The planned sales of significant subsidiaries;         •   The continuing liquidity issues in AIG’s businesses and AIG’s actions to address such issues; and         •   The substantial risks to which AIG is subject.       See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2008 Form 10-K, Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion below for further details on these items.     In considering these items, management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of AIG’s risks and uncertainties. Management also assessed other items and risks arising in AIG’s businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto. After consideration, management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate AIG’s businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months.     It is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management’s plans could be materially different or that one or more of management’s significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of the risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect or that the proposed transactions discussed below are not consummated. If one or more of these possible outcomes is realized, AIG may need additional U.S. government support to meet its obligations as they come due.    90    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Capital Resources and Liquidity     Liquidity     Liquidity Position     At July 29, 2009, AIG had outstanding net borrowings under the FRBNY Facility of $40.0 billion, with a remaining borrowing capacity of $20.0 billion, and accrued compounding interest and fees totaled $4.8 billion.     Net borrowings outstanding and remaining available amount that can be borrowed under the FRBNY Facility were as follows:                                                      Inception Through                 December 31,        June 30,        Increase            2008       2009       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Net borrowings:                               Loans to AIGFP for collateral postings, GIA and other debt maturities      $   46,997       $   50,847       $   3,850        AIGFP repayments to AIG        (4,093   )       (7,939   )       (3,846   )      Capital contributions and loans to insurance companies(a)        20,850         23,233         2,383        Repayment of obligations to securities lending program        3,160         3,160         —        Repayment of intercompany loans        1,528         1,528         —        Contributions to AIGCFG subsidiaries(b)        1,672         1,215         (457   )      Loans to ILFC        —         1,700         1,700        Debt payments        2,109         3,474         1,365        Funding of equity interest in ML III        5,000         5,000         —        Repayment from the proceeds of the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock and common stock warrant        (40,000   )       (40,000   )       —        Other(c)        (423   )       (2,218   )       (1,795   )                                  Net borrowings        36,800         40,000         3,200                                    Total FRBNY Facility        60,000         60,000         —                                    Remaining available amount        23,200         20,000         (3,200   )                                  Net borrowings        36,800         40,000         3,200        Accrued compounding interest and fees(d)        3,631         4,816         1,185                                    Total balance outstanding      $   40,431       $   44,816       $   4,385                                                 (a)    Includes securities lending activities.      (b)    Includes repayments and sales of subsidiaries.      (c)    Includes repayments with proceeds from the CPFF and tax refunds.      (d)    Excludes interest payable of $8 million and $5 million at December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2009, respectively, which was included in Other liabilities.      On April 17, 2009, AIG entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Department of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Department of the Treasury will provide an amount up to $29.835 billion (the Department of the Treasury Commitment) in exchange for increases in the liquidation preference of AIG’s Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the AIG Series F Preferred Stock), so long as (i) AIG is not a debtor in a pending case under Title 11 of the United States Code; and (ii) the AIG Credit Facility Trust, a trust established for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury (Trust) (or any successor entity established for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury) and the Department of the Treasury, in the aggregate, “beneficially own” more than 50 percent of the aggregate voting power of AIG’s voting securities. Upon drawings under this commitment, the liquidation preference of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock increases proportionately.    91    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       A summary of drawdown activity and available amount under the Department of the Treasury Commitment were as follows:                              Inception Through            June 30, 2009           (In millions)            Initial drawdown for capital contribution to Domestic Life & Retirement Services companies      $   1,150                    Total drawdowns        1,150                                Original availability under commitment      $   29,835        Total drawdowns        (1,150   )                  Remaining available amount      $   28,685                                   On August 6, 2009, AIG delivered a notice of an additional drawdown of approximately $2.1 billion under the Department of Treasury Commitment. AIG expects to receive the funds on August 13, 2009.     Additional details regarding liquidity sources are included in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries below.     Completed and Proposed Transactions in the Second Quarter of 2009     See Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the following transactions that were consummated in April 2009:              •   Exchange of AIG Series D Preferred Stock for AIG’s Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (AIG Series E Preferred Stock);         •   Issuance of AIG Series F Preferred Stock and the entry into the Department of the Treasury Commitment; and         •   Amendment No. 3 to the FRBNY Credit Agreement which, among other things, removed the minimum 3.5 percent London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) borrowing rate floor.       AIA Purchase Agreement      On June 25, 2009, AIG and AIRCO entered into the AIA Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY pursuant to which the FRBNY will purchase preferred equity interests in a newly-formed special purpose vehicle in exchange for a reduction of $16 billion in the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder (provided the maximum amount available under the FRBNY Facility will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction).     ALICO Purchase Agreement      On June 25, 2009, AIG entered into the ALICO Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY pursuant to which the FRBNY will purchase preferred equity interests in a newly-formed special purpose vehicle in exchange for a reduction of $9 billion in the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder (provided the maximum amount available under the FRBNY Facility will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction).     Amortization of Prepaid Commitment Asset     Any permanent reduction in the FRBNY Facility will result in accelerated amortization of a portion of the prepaid commitment asset. Therefore, AIG anticipates that the consummation of each of the AIA Purchase Agreement and the ALICO Purchase Agreement will result in accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset at the time that the senior interests are transferred to the FRBNY, currently expected to occur no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2009. Acceleration of the amortization will result in a pre-tax charge to earnings which could aggregate to approximately $5.0 billion.    92    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Life Insurance Securitizations      On March 2, 2009, AIG and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced their intent to enter into transactions pursuant to which the FRBNY will purchase embedded value securitization notes issued by newly-formed SPVs to be repaid with the net cash flows from designated blocks of existing life insurance policies. The proceeds of the notes would be applied in settlement of a portion of the outstanding balance of the FRBNY Facility and would reduce the maximum amount to be borrowed thereunder (provided the maximum amount available under the FRBNY Facility will not be less than $25 billion as a result of such reduction). The amount of the FRBNY Facility reduction will be based on the proceeds received and will also result in accelerated amortization of a portion of the prepaid commitment asset. The SPVs are expected to be consolidated by AIG.     See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions.     AIG’s Strategy for Stabilization and Repayment of its Obligations as They Come Due     Future Cash Requirements     The following table shows the maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                                                              Third        Fourth        First        Second                  Quarter        Quarter        Quarter        Quarter                   2009        2009       2010       2010       Total           (In millions)            AIG      $   4       $   1,000       $   888       $   —       $   1,892        AIG MIP        —         —         500         —         500        AIGFP        2,092         1,183         891         423         4,589        ILFC(a)        1,199         2,998         738         1,473         6,408        AGF(b)(c)        3,209         1,661         739         591         6,200        Other subsidiaries        169         294         219         206         888                                                    Total      $   6,673       $   7,136       $   3,975       $   2,693       $   20,477                                                                 (a)    International Lease Finance Corporation.      (b)    American General Finance, Inc.      (c)    On July 9, 2009, AGF converted the $2.45 billion of loans that AGF had previously drawn on its 364-Day Syndicated Facility into one-year term loans. These termed-out loans must be repaid by July 9, 2010.      In addition, at July 29, 2009, AIG affiliates had $10.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding under the CPFF, all of which matures in October 2009. This includes $3.4 billion issued by AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding). If AIG’s short-term ratings are downgraded, AIG may lose access to the CPFF and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper.     AIG expects to meet these obligations primarily through borrowings from the FRBNY Facility and the cash flows from, and the disposition of, assets supporting these obligations. Additional liquidity is also available under the Department of Treasury Commitment. Debt maturities for the Matched Investment Program (MIP) are expected to be funded through cash flows generated from invested assets (principal and interest) as well as the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program. Approximately $3.3 billion of AIGFP’s debt maturities through June 30, 2010 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities. It is expected that AGF and ILFC will require support from AIG, in addition to their cash flows from operations and proceeds from potential asset sales and securitizations, to meet their existing obligations. AIG intends to provide such support through August 15, 2010 to the extent that asset sales, securitizations and/or other transactions are not sufficient.     In the first six months of 2009, AIG made capital contributions of $2.4 billion to certain of its Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies. Approximately $1.2 billion of this amount was funded through drawdowns under the Department of the Treasury Commitment. If a substantial portion of the Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services bond portfolio diminishes significantly in value or suffers adverse credit events, AIG may need to provide additional capital support for these operations.    93    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIG made capital contributions of $641 million to its Commercial Insurance companies in the first six months of 2009, all of which was returned as a dividend to AIG in July 2009. In addition, in connection with the sale by a Commercial Insurance subsidiary of a portion of its common stock of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), AIG made a capital contribution of $91 million in the second quarter of 2009 to that company.     AIG also made a $600 million capital contribution to AGF (through AIG Capital Corporation) during the first six months of 2009, and AGF loaned $800 million to AIG parent under a demand note.     AIG has developed certain plans (described below), some of which have already been implemented, to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the FRBNY Facility; other plans are still being formulated.     Asset Disposition Plan     AIG has revised its asset disposition plans over the last nine months to take into account the deterioration of global market conditions. AIG’s current asset disposition plan is to maximize the value of its businesses over a longer time frame. AIG continually reassesses its disposition plans and may revise its disposition plans at any time and from time to time.     Sales of Businesses and Specific Asset Dispositions     Sales of Businesses     Dispositions of certain businesses will be subject to regulatory approval. Proceeds from these dispositions, to the extent they do not represent capital of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries required for regulatory or ratings purposes, are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the FRBNY Facility as mandatory prepayments.     During the first six months of 2009 and through July 31, 2009, AIG entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets, excluding AIGFP assets, that had aggregate assets and liabilities with carrying values of $31.2 billion and $23.8 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2009 or the date of sale or in the case of Transatlantic, deconsolidation. Aggregate net proceeds from these sale transactions are expected to be approximately $8.0 billion. These transactions are expected to generate approximately $4.6 billion of aggregate net cash proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings on, and reduce the amount of, the FRBNY Facility, after taking into account taxes, transaction expenses and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes. Gains and losses recorded in connection with the disposals of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment. Based on the transactions thus far, AIG does not believe that such adjustments will be material to future results of operations or cash flows.     These transactions included the following:              •   On June 10, 2009, AIG closed a public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock owned by AIG for aggregate proceeds of $1.1 billion. At the close of the public offering, AIG retained 13.9 percent of Transatlantic’s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, AIG deconsolidated Transatlantic, which resulted in a $1.4 billion reduction in Noncontrolling interest, a component of Total equity.         •   On July 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of its U.S. auto insurance business, 21st Century Insurance Group. This operation had total assets and liabilities with carrying values of $5.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2009. Aggregate proceeds from the sale of this business, including proceeds applied to repay intercompany loan facilities, were $1.9 billion.         •   On May 28, 2009, AIG completed the sale of its headquarters building in Tokyo for approximately $1.2 billion in cash. Due to AIG’s continued involvement as a lessee, primarily in the form of a lease deposit, through 2011, the sale is accounted for as a financing arrangement with any gain deferred until the expiration of AIG’s leases in early 2011.         •   On July 28, 2009, AIG completed the sale of a majority of the U.S. life insurance premium finance business of AIG Credit Corp. and A.I. Credit Consumer Discount Company (A.I.Credit), with a carrying value of $941.3 million at that date, for $680 million in cash, including $230 million held in escrow.      94    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Securitization Transaction     During the first six months of 2009, AGF received proceeds of $1.4 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales. In addition, on July 30, 2009, AGF issued mortgage-backed certificates in a private securitization transaction of certain AGF real estate loans and received initial cash proceeds of $967 million.     AIGFP Wind-down     AIGFP is engaged in a multi-step process of unwinding its businesses and portfolios. In connection with that process, certain assets have been sold, or are under contract to be sold. The proceeds from these sales will be used to fund AIGFP’s wind-down and are not included in the amounts above. The FRBNY has waived the requirement under the FRBNY Credit Agreement that the proceeds of these specific pending sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the FRBNY Facility, which would result in a permanent reduction of the FRBNY’s commitment to lend to AIG. Instead, the FRBNY has given AIGFP permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales, and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the FRBNY Facility, with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the FRBNY Facility. With the consent of the FRBNY, AIGFP is also opportunistically terminating contracts. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with AIG’s affiliated businesses. Due to the long-term duration of AIGFP’s derivative contracts and the complexity of AIGFP’s portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down of AIGFP will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIG’s control, including market conditions, AIGFP’s access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.     AIG continually evaluates overall market conditions, performance of businesses that are for sale, and market and business performance of competitors and likely bidders for these assets. This evaluation informs decision-making about the timing and process of putting businesses up for sale. Depending on market and business conditions, as noted above, AIG can modify its sales approach to maximize value for AIG and the U.S. taxpayers in the disposition process. Such a modification could result in the sale of additional or other assets.     Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries      AIG (Parent)     AIG Parent had the following sources of liquidity:                                          As of           June 30,        July 29,              2009       2009           (In millions)            Available borrowing under the FRBNY Facility      $   20,000       $   20,000        Available commercial paper borrowings under the CPFF        1,945         3,493        Cash and short-term investments        639         407        Available capacity under the Department of the Treasury Commitment        28,685         28,685                            Total      $   51,269       $   52,585                               As a result, AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the Parent to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, no assurance can be given that AIG’s cash needs will not exceed projected amounts. Additional collateral calls at AIGFP, a further downgrade of AIG’s credit ratings or unexpected capital or liquidity needs of AIG’s subsidiaries may result in significant additional cash needs. For a further discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Form 10-K.     Since the fourth quarter of 2008, AIG has not had access to its traditional sources of long-term or short-term financing through the public debt markets. Further, in light of the performance of AIG’s common stock, AIG does not expect to be able to issue equity securities for cash in the public markets in the foreseeable future.    95    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Historically AIG depended on dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations. In light of AIG’s current financial situation, many of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG (see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Form 10-K). As a result, AIG has been dependent on the FRBNY Facility, the CPFF and other transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury as its primary sources of liquidity. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, AIG parent collected $608 million in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries (primarily from insurance company subsidiaries), and retired $381 million of debt, excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt. Excluding MIP and Series AIGFP debt, AIG parent made interest payments totaling $1.0 billion, and made $2.3 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the six months ended June 30, 2009. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2009, AIG parent made loans totaling $1.2 billion to wholly owned subsidiaries, which in turn principally were used to make capital contributions to insurance companies.     AIG parent traditionally funded a portion of its short-term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. Since October 2008, all commercial paper issuance for AIG Funding has been through the CPFF program. AIG Funding was accepted into the CPFF with a total borrowing limit of $6.9 billion, and had approximately $4.9 billion and $3.4 billion outstanding at June 30, 2009 and July 29, 2009, respectively. All commercial paper outstanding for AIG Funding as of these dates was issued under the CPFF. As of June 30, 2009 and July 29, 2009, AIG Funding’s commercial paper program had average maturities of 25 days, and 86 days, respectively. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has extended the CPFF program until February 1, 2010, with the maximum final maturity of 90 days from that date. If AIG’s short-term ratings are downgraded, AIG may lose access to the CPFF and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper.     AIG expects to use a portion of the proceeds from the repayment of intercompany debt received in connection with the sales of assets to fund maturing commercial paper.     AIG’s liquidity could also be further impaired by unforeseen significant outflows of cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may be unable to control, such as a further reduction in asset values, a ratings downgrade, a worsening of the current recession or the requirements of subsidiaries to replace capital as a consequence of catastrophe claims. Regulatory and other legal restrictions would likely limit AIG’s ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.     General Insurance     During the six months ended June 30, 2009, AIG made a capital contribution of $641 million to a Commercial Insurance subsidiary, all of which was returned as a dividend to AIG in July 2009. In addition, in connection with the sale by a Commercial Insurance subsidiary of a portion of its common shares of Transatlantic, AIG made a capital contribution of $91 million in the second quarter of 2009 to that company.     AIG currently expects that its General Insurance subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. One or more large catastrophes, however, may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected General Insurance operations. In addition, further downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries. A downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect these companies’ ability to meet their own obligations and require that AIG provide capital or liquidity support to them. For a discussion of AIG’s potential inability to support its subsidiaries, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity in the 2008 Form 10-K.     At June 30, 2009, General Insurance had liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments of $12.4 billion. These are consolidated cash and short-term investments for a number of legal entities within General Insurance. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, there are generally sufficient cash and short-term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs. In the event additional liquidity is required, management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities. Government and corporate bonds represented 95.8 percent of General Insurance total fixed income    96    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     investments at June 30, 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG’s General Insurance investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. AIG’s asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of AIG’s General Insurance investments and the payment of claims.     Life Insurance & Retirement Services     At June 30, 2009, Life Insurance & Retirement Services had liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments of $39.8 billion. These are consolidated cash and short-term investments for a number of legal entities within Life Insurance & Retirement Services. Generally, these assets are not transferable across various legal entities; however, there are generally sufficient cash and short-term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs. In the event additional liquidity is required, management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities. Government and corporate bonds represented 86.2 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services total fixed income investments at June 30, 2009. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios, AIG believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk. The Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries have been able to meet liquidity needs, even during the period of higher surrenders which was experienced from mid-September 2008 through June 30, 2009, and expect to be able to do so in the foreseeable future. A significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals, which could be triggered by a variety of factors, including AIG specific concerns, could result in a substantial liquidity strain. Other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other economic or political upheaval.     Foreign Life Insurance Companies     AIG’s Foreign Life Insurance companies (including ALICO) had significant capital needs following publicity of AIG parent’s liquidity issues, related credit ratings downgrades and the decline in the equity markets in 2008. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, AIG provided funding of $300 million to a subsidiary within the Foreign Life Insurance companies.     AIG believes that its Foreign Life Insurance subsidiaries have adequate capital to support their business plans through 2009. However, to the extent the investment portfolios of the Foreign Life Insurance companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions, AIG may need to lend or contribute additional capital to these companies. For a discussion of AIG’s potential inability to support its subsidiaries, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity in the 2008 Form 10-K.     Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services Companies     During the six months ended June 30, 2009, AIG contributed capital totaling $2.4 billion to certain of its Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services subsidiaries (of which $165 million was retained in the Domestic Life Insurance holding company and not contributed to the operating companies) to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses (primarily resulting from other-than-temporary impairment charges) and other investment-related items. Of this amount, $1.2 billion was funded by a drawdown under the Department of the Treasury Commitment in May 2009. Further capital contributions may be required to maintain desired levels of capital to the extent the investment portfolios of the Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions.     The most significant potential liquidity needs of AIG’s Domestic Life Insurance and Domestic Retirement Services companies are the funding of surrenders and the restoration of capital eroded by investment related losses. A substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies. However, AIG currently has sufficient short-term liquidity to meet such demands. For a discussion of AIG’s potential inability to support its subsidiaries, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity in the 2008 Form 10-K.    97    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Financial Services     AIG’s major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of ILFC, AIGFP, AGF and AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). Traditional sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available. These sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), issuance of long-and short-term debt, issuance of commercial paper, bank loans and bank credit facilities. However, ILFC has been able to finance Airbus aircraft purchases under its 2004 Export Credit Agency (ECA) Facility, as further described below, and AIGCFG has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits, providing a measure of liquidity.     ILFC     Prior to September 2008, ILFC’s traditional sources of liquidity had been collections of aircraft lease payments, borrowings in the public debt markets, borrowings under its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities to fund aircraft purchases, proceeds of aircraft sales and income from third parties for fleet management services.     During the first six months of 2009, ILFC was unable to borrow in the public debt markets and, due to downgrades in its short-term credit rating, lost access to the CPFF and therefore borrowed $1.7 billion from AIG Funding to repay its maturing debt and other contractual obligations. In addition, ILFC borrowed approximately $161 million through secured financing arrangements. ILFC is currently pursuing additional secured financings from banks and manufacturers. ILFC has the capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing of approximately $5.0 billion (or more through subsidiaries that qualify as non-restricted subsidiaries under ILFC’s indentures, subject to the receipt of any required consents under the FRBNY Facility and under its bank facilities and terms loans). If ILFC does not receive sufficient secured financing, AIG expects that ILFC’s current borrowings and future cash flows from operations, which may include aircraft sales, will be inadequate to permit ILFC to meet its existing obligations. Therefore, AIG intends to provide support to ILFC through August 15, 2010 to the extent that secured financing, aircraft sales and other sources of funds are not sufficient.     Under its current long-term debt ratings, ILFC needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 ECA Facility before it can fund Airbus purchases under the facility. ILFC financed 24 aircraft under the facility during the first six months of 2009, 18 of which required written consent, which was obtained. ILFC’s current credit ratings also require segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves related to aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts. At June 30, 2009, ILFC had segregated approximately $264 million of deposits and maintenance reserves. As a result of Moody’s downgrade of ILFC’s long-term debt ratings to Baa3 on July 31, 2009, ILFC will be required to segregate subsequent rental payments on the aircraft funded under its 2004 ECA Facility and may be required to transfer control of the segregated rentals, maintenance reserves and security deposits related to these aircraft, currently $192.7 million, to the security trustee of the facility. ILFC may also be required to file individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which its lessees operate. The amount of funds segregated fluctuates with changes in the related deposits, maintenance reserves and debt maturities. Further downgrades by S&P and Moody’s could impose additional restrictions under the 1999 ECA Facility, including the requirement to segregate rental payments and to receive prior consent to withdraw funds from the segregated accounts.     AIGFP     Prior to September 2008, AIGFP had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds, GIA borrowings, other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements.     In the second half of 2008, AIGFP’s access to its traditional sources of liquidity was significantly reduced and it relied on AIG parent to meet most of its liquidity needs. AIGFP’s asset backed commercial paper conduit, Curzon Funding LLC, was accepted into the CPFF with a total borrowing limit of $7.2 billion, and had approximately $6.2 billion outstanding at July 29, 2009. Separately, a structured investment vehicle sponsored, but not consolidated, by AIGFP, Nightingale Finance LLC, was also accepted into the CPFF with a borrowing limit of $1.1 billion. As of July 29, 2009, this vehicle had issued approximately $1.1 billion under the CPFF. If AIG’s short-term ratings are downgraded, these entities may lose access to the CPFF and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper.    98    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by AIGFP:                                                                        Additional                        Collateral        Postings,        Collateral        Collateral        Six Months Ended      Posted as of        Netted by        Returned by        Posted as of         June 30, 2009      December 31, 2008       Counterparty       Counterparties       June 30, 2009                 (In millions)                  Collateralized GIAs and other borrowings      $   9,401       $   374       $   2,533       $   7,242        Derivatives (including super senior credit default swaps)        22,791         6,146         9,532         19,405                                            Total      $   32,192       $   6,520       $   12,065       $   26,647                                               AGF     Prior to September 2008, AGF’s traditional source of liquidity has been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets.     With its continued inability to access traditional capital market sources, AGF anticipates that its primary source of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections. In order to improve cash flow from operations, AGF has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses. Since September 2008 and through July 2009, AGF’s alternative funding sources have included proceeds of $1.4 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales and initial cash proceeds of $967 million from a real estate loan securitization. AGF is considering additional sales and/or securitizations of its finance receivables. AIG intends to provide support to AGF through August 15, 2010 to the extent that asset sales, securitizations and/or other transactions are not sufficient. In March 2009, AIG made a $600 million capital contribution to AGF (through AIG Capital Corporation), and AGF loaned $800 million to AIG parent under a demand note.     With AIG’s continued support, AIG believes that AGF will have adequate funds to meet its debt and other obligations payable during the next twelve months.     AIGCFG     AIG believes that the funding needs of AIGCFG have stabilized, but it is possible that renewed customer and counterparty concerns could substantially increase AIGCFG’s liquidity needs in 2009. During the first six months of 2009 and through July 31, 2009, AIG has completed the sale of certain AIGCFG businesses in China, Thailand, the Philippines and Mexico.     Asset Management     Asset Management’s principal cash requirements are to fund general working capital needs, investment commitments related to proprietary investments in private equity and real estate as well as any liquidity mismatches in the Spread-Based Investment business. Management continues to work closely with partners and counterparties to manage future funding requirements on proprietary investments through various strategies including through relinquishing rights in certain properties and funds and the restructuring of investment relationships.     Cash requirements related to Institutional Asset Management are funded through general operating cash flows from management and performance fees, proceeds from events in underlying funds (capital calls to third parties, sale of portfolio companies, etc.) as well as intercompany funding provided by AIG. Consequently, Institutional Asset Management’s ability to fund certain of its needs may depend on advances from AIG under various intercompany borrowing facilities. Restrictions on these facilities would have adverse consequences on the ability of the business to satisfy its obligations. With respect to the Global Real Estate business, investing activities are also funded through third-party financing arrangements which are secured by the relevant properties.     The Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) and MIP programs are in run-off. AIG expects to fund its obligations under these programs through cash flows generated from invested assets (principal and interest) as well as sales of investments, primarily fixed maturity securities. However, market illiquidity and diminished values within the investment portfolios may impair AIG’s ability to sell the related program assets or sell such assets for a    99    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     price adequate to settle the corresponding liabilities when they come due. In such a case, AIG parent would need to fund the obligations.

(c)    On July 9, 2009, AGF converted the $2.45 billion of loans that AGF had previously drawn on its 364-Day Syndicated Facility into one-year term loans. These termed-out loans must be repaid by July 9, 2010.     102    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIG (Parent Company)     AIG historically issued debt securities from time to time to meet its financing needs and those of certain of its subsidiaries, as well as to opportunistically fund the MIP. The maturities of the debt securities issued by AIG to fund the MIP are generally expected to be paid using the cash flows of assets held by AIG as part of the MIP portfolio. However, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows of the MIP, as well as shortfalls due to impairments of MIP assets, would need to be funded by AIG parent.     As of June 30, 2009, approximately $7.1 billion principal amount of senior notes were outstanding under AIG’s medium-term note program, of which $3.2 billion was used for AIG’s general corporate purposes, $561 million was used by AIGFP (included within “Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable” in the preceding tables) and $3.3 billion was used to fund the MIP. The maturity dates of these notes range from 2009 to 2052. To the extent considered appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.     As of June 30, 2009, the equivalent of $11.3 billion of notes were outstanding under AIG’s Euro medium-term note program, of which $9.3 billion were used to fund the MIP and the remainder was used for AIG’s general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount outstanding includes a $686 million loss resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars, including a $45 million loss related to notes issued by AIG for general corporate purposes and a $641 million loss related to notes issued to fund the MIP. AIG has economically hedged the currency exposure arising from its foreign currency denominated notes.     AIGFP      Approximately $3.3 billion of AIGFP’s debt maturing through June 30, 2010 is fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities. However, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and AIGFP’s ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG parent.     ILFC      ILFC has a $4.3 billion 1999 ECA Facility that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.77 percent to 5.86 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At June 30, 2009, ILFC had 37 loans with a remaining principal balance of $232 million outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility.     ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 ECA Facility, which was amended in May 2009 to allow ILFC to borrow up to a maximum of $4.6 billion to fund the purchase of Airbus aircraft delivered through June 30, 2010. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a forward-looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 2.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 4.20 percent to 4.71 percent. At June 30, 2009, ILFC had approximately $3.0 billion outstanding under this facility. At June 30, 2009, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 1.24 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC’s notes and bonds payable in the preceding table of borrowings.     At June 30, 2009, the total funded amount of ILFC’s bank financings was $7.6 billion, which includes $6.5 billion of revolving credit facilities (see Revolving Credit Facilities below). The fundings mature through February 2012. The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.63 percent. At June 30, 2009, the interest rates ranged from 0.91 percent to 2.25 percent. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.    103    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       In April 2009, ILFC entered into a $100 million 90-day promissory note agreement with a supplier in connection with the purchase of an aircraft. The interest rate was fixed at an annual rate of 5.00 percent. The note was paid in full in July 2009, when it matured.     AGF     As of June 30, 2009, notes and bonds aggregating $21.4 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from 0.71 percent to 9.00 percent. To the extent considered appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes and bonds.     AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF but has provided a capital support agreement for the benefit of AGF’s lenders under the AGF 364-Day Syndicated Facility. Under this support agreement, AIG has agreed to cause AGF to maintain (1) consolidated net worth of $2.2 billion and (2) an adjusted tangible leverage ratio of less than or equal to 8 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter. This support agreement only benefits the lenders under the AGF 364-Day Syndicated Facility and does not benefit, and is not enforceable by, any of the other creditors of AGF. This support agreement continued for the benefit of AGF’s lenders upon the conversion of the facility borrowings into one-year term loans in July 2009.     Revolving Credit Facilities     AIG, ILFC and AGF maintain committed, unsecured revolving credit facilities listed on the table below in order to support their respective commercial paper programs and for general corporate purposes. Some of the facilities, as noted below, contain a “term-out option” allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. Both ILFC and AGF have drawn the full amount available under their revolving credit facilities. In July 2009, AIG’s 364-Day Syndicated Facility expired and, in August 2009, AIG terminated its 5-Year Syndicated Facility. As a result, AIG no longer has access to these facilities referenced in the table below.     A summary of revolving credit facilities is as follows:                                                                                One-Year      At June 30, 2009                Available            Term-Out       Facility      Size        Borrower(s)      Amount        Expiration      Option     (In millions)                                  AIG:                                   364-Day Syndicated Facility      $   2,125       AIG/AIG Funding(a)     $   2,125       July 2009(b)     Yes      5-Year Syndicated Facility        1,625       AIG/AIG Funding(a)       1,625       July 2011(c)     No                                      Total AIG      $   3,750           $   3,750                                                ILFC:                                   5-Year Syndicated Facility      $   2,500       ILFC     $   —       October 2011     No      5-Year Syndicated Facility        2,000       ILFC       —       October 2010     No      5-Year Syndicated Facility        2,000       ILFC       —       October 2009     No                                      Total ILFC      $   6,500           $   —                                                AGF:                                   364-Day Syndicated Facility      $   2,450       American General Finance Corporation     $   —       July 2009(d)     Yes                 American General Finance, Inc.(e)       —                5-Year Syndicated Facility        2,125       American General Finance Corporation       —       July 2010     No                                      Total AGF      $   4,575           $   —                                                             (a)    Guaranteed by AIG.

Credit Ratings     The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of July 31, 2009. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating’s relative rank within the agency’s rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.     “Ratings triggers” have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. “Ratings triggers” generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.     A significant portion of AIGFP’s GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require AIGFP, upon a downgrade of AIG’s long-term debt ratings, to post collateral or, with the consent of the counterparties, assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its    105    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.     The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effect of a downgrade in AIG’s credit ratings on AIGFP’s outstanding municipal GIAs, secured funding arrangements and financial derivative transactions, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Form 10-K.     Contractual Obligations     Contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity, are as follows:                                                                                                Payments due by Period           Total        Remainder        2010 –        2012 –                     At June 30, 2009      Payments       of 2009       2011       2013       2014       Thereafter           (In millions)            Borrowings(a)      $   118,512       $   13,809       $   32,559       $   18,361       $   3,264       $   50,519        FRBNY Facility        44,816         —         —         44,816         —         —        Interest payments on borrowings        69,043         2,201         8,833         15,451         3,005         39,553        Loss reserves(b)        82,088         10,015         26,432         14,571         4,761         26,309        Insurance and investment contract liabilities(c)        633,681         21,375         38,323         43,211         22,302         508,470        GIC liabilities(d)        12,415         3,440         2,013         3,080         124         3,758        Aircraft purchase commitments        14,271         580         490         2,917         1,791         8,493        Other long-term obligations        503         188         275         20         6         14                                                            Total(e)(f)      $   975,329       $   51,608       $   108,925       $   142,427       $   35,253       $   637,116                                                                         (a)    Excludes commercial paper and borrowings incurred by consolidated investments and includes hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value.      (b)    Represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments.      (c)    Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of AIG’s control. AIG has made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits, which assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on inforce policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the balance sheet.      (d)    Represents guaranteed maturities under GICs.      (e)    Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $3.7 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.      (f)    The majority of AIGFP’s credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At June 30, 2009, the fair value derivative liability was $5.3 billion relating to AIGFP’s super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, net of amounts realized in      106    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries               extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, AIGFP has posted collateral of $4.6 billion with respect to these swaps (prior to offsets for other transactions).      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity were as follows:                                                                                                      Amount of Commitment Expiration           Total Amounts        Remainder        2010 –        2012 –                     At June 30, 2009      Committed       of 2009       2011       2013       2014       Thereafter           (In millions)            Guarantees:                                                       Liquidity facilities(a)      $   922       $   —       $   556       $   215       $   —       $   151        Standby letters of credit        1,284         1,100         34         19         —         131        Construction guarantees(b)        239         2         145         —         —         92        Guarantees of indebtedness        381         163         —         —         —         218        All other guarantees        2,126         20         46         188         49         1,823        Commitments:                                                       Investment commitments(c)        7,929         2,387         2,447         1,641         409         1,045        Commitments to extend credit        305         94         168         35         6         2        Letters of credit        266         182         83         1         —         —        Other commercial commitments(d)        697         36         —         —         —         661                                                            Total(e)      $   14,149       $   3,984       $   3,479       $   2,099       $   464       $   4,123                                                                         (a)    Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.

(c)    Includes commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad.      (d)    Includes options to acquire aircraft. Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The annual pension contribution for 2009 is expected to be approximately $600 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.      (e)    Does not include guarantees or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.      Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities      AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business. AIG’s insurance companies are involved with VIEs primarily as passive investors in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. Through its Financial Services and Asset Management operations, AIG has participated in arrangements that included designing and structuring entities (including VIEs), warehousing and managing the collateral of the entities (including VIEs), entering into insurance transactions with VIEs. Interest holders in the VIEs generally have recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to AIG, except, in limited circumstances, when AIG has provided a guarantee to the VIEs’ interest holders.     Under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the party that either (i) absorbs a majority of the VIE’s expected losses; (ii) receives a majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns; or (iii) both. For a further discussion of AIG’s involvement with VIEs, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    107    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Outlook     Global financial markets recovered somewhat in the second quarter of 2009, with investors apparently anticipating a bottoming-out of the economic recession. This relative optimism, increased liquidity and perceived stabilization of the financial sector and mortgage markets precipitated a rally in bond, equity and commodity markets. Prices, which had been severely depressed in recent quarters, stabilized and, in some cases, rose significantly. Certain sectors, such as commercial mortgages and municipal bonds, continue to experience lagged effects of the recession, and thus the price rally, while widespread, was not uniform.     As AIG implements the proposed transactions with the FRBNY described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and executes its plans for repaying the FRBNY Facility, AIG expects to incur significant additional restructuring-related charges, such as accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset and, potentially, the write-off of intangible assets. Further, if AIG continues to incur losses in its businesses, AIG may need to write off material amounts of goodwill and deferred tax assets.     On June 10, 2009, the Treasury Department issued regulations implementing the compensation limits of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These regulations restrict the amount of bonus and other incentive compensation that a company may pay to certain employees. For AIG these limits apply to the five executives named in AIG’s proxy statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of AIG. The regulations also create the Office of Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, which is responsible for interpreting and applying the compensation regulations. AIG is required to obtain the Special Master’s approval of the compensation of AIG’s five named executives and next 20 most highly compensated employees, and the compensation structure of AIG’s executive officers and 100 most highly compensated employees. Given the restrictions on compensation contained in these regulations, and the necessity of obtaining Special Master approval for compensation of AIG’s most highly compensated employees, it is possible that AIG may be unable to create a compensation structure that permits AIG to retain its highest performing employees.     Almost all of AIG’s businesses were adversely affected in the first half of 2009 by the criticism and negative publicity that surrounded the honoring of and payment of retention contracts to employees of AIGFP. For a discussion of the effect that continued or renewed criticism or additional negative publicity may have on AIG, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of AIG’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.     General Insurance     AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad and constitute Commercial Insurance and the Foreign General Insurance Group. On July 27, 2009, it was announced that AIG’s General Insurance would undergo a rebranding and would do business as Chartis, which will consist of Commercial Insurance (operating as Chartis U.S.), Foreign General Insurance (operating as Chartis International), and Private Client Group (part of Chartis U.S.).     AIG’s Commercial Insurance operations have been generally successful in retaining clients, however, some clients have reduced the number of lines or limits of coverage. This trend of de-risking is due in part to the overall state of the economy as well as continued concerns over AIG’s financial strength. New business production has also been impacted by the economic downturn, primarily in workers’ compensation, construction, transportation and real estate lines of business. Rates in the second quarter remained stable reflecting the upward pressure on premiums from the combination of investment and underwriting losses suffered by the commercial insurance industry, partially offset by the effects of the current recessionary environment, such as employment levels for workers’ compensation coverages and shipments of goods for commercial automobile coverages, as well as the recent introduction of new competitors in the marketplace.     For third quarter, 2009, Foreign General Insurance expects to be able to maintain solid client retention rates in key regions and achieve satisfactory underwriting results despite the challenging environment. The trend of de-risking by some customers and the economic downturn will continue to adversely affect Foreign General’s net premiums written, primarily through a decline in new business production. Although Foreign General continues to face challenges in commercial lines, particularly in the U.K. and Europe regions, due to increased competition and    108    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     worldwide credit related insurance exposures, its traditional capabilities of servicing its customers, innovation and claims paying ability continue to attract new accounts.     Life Insurance & Retirement Services     AIG expects that negative publicity about AIG during the first half of 2009, AIG’s previously announced asset disposition plan and the uncertainties related to AIG will continue to adversely affect Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations for the remainder of 2009, especially in the domestic businesses. In addition, although the markets are showing signs of modest recovery, the continued market disruption will adversely affect operating income for the remainder of 2009, especially with respect to deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization, net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses). In addition, AIG’s issues have affected certain operations through higher surrender activity, primarily in the U.S. domestic retirement fixed annuity business and foreign investment-oriented and retirement products. While surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid-September of 2008, they continue to be higher than historic levels in certain products and countries and AIG expects surrender activity to continue to be volatile.     These uncertainties, together with rating agency downgrades, have resulted in significantly reduced levels of new sales activity, particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical. Sales of investment-oriented and retirement services products have also declined due to the general decline in the equity markets. New sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels for certain markets until the uncertainties relating to AIG are resolved. With the transactions noted below, AIA and ALICO have experienced improved operating conditions and are expected to continue to improve as the separation from AIG and rebranding initiatives continue.     On June 25, 2009, AIG and AIRCO entered into the AIA Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY and AIG entered into the ALICO Purchase Agreement with the FRBNY. The transactions contemplated by the AIA Purchase Agreement and the ALICO Purchase Agreement are conditioned on one another and subject to certain other conditions, including regulatory approvals. It is expected that the transactions will result in a $25 billion permanent reduction in the FRBNY credit facility.     With the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments” (FSP FAS 115-2), AIG expects future investment yields to decline compared to the same periods in 2008 due to lower accretion. In prior periods, AIG accreted into income over the expected period to recovery the discount or reduced premium resulting from the reduction in the cost basis of other-than-temporarily impaired securities, which consisted primarily of securities impaired for severity reasons. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, this accretion totaled $342 million. Upon the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2, approximately $1.8 billion of previously recognized other-than-temporarily impaired charges, primarily severity related, were reclassified from Accumulated deficit to Accumulated other comprehensive income. As a consequence, commencing in the second quarter of 2009, there will be no accretion attributable to the amounts reclassified into Accumulated other comprehensive income. This will be partially offset by lower DAC and SIA amortization in future periods resulting from the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2. Additionally, higher liquidity and de-risking activities continue to negatively affect net investment income margins.     Financial Services     AIGFP began unwinding its businesses and portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2008, and these activities are expected to continue beyond 2009. In connection with these activities, AIGFP has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate “books,” and has developed a plan for addressing each book, including assessing each book’s risks, risk mitigation options, monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes. Each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of AIG. The plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve, and they contemplate, depending on the book in question, alternative strategies, including sales, assignments or other transfers of positions, terminations of positions, and/or run-offs of positions in accordance with existing terms. Execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving increasingly senior members of AIGFP’s and AIG’s respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences. Successful execution of these plans is subject, to varying degrees depending on the    109    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     transactions of a given book, to market conditions and, in many circumstances, counterparty negotiation and agreement.     As a consequence of its wind-down strategy, AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses. AIGFP has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio, including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs in connection with the Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) transaction, a sale of its commodity index business, termination and sale of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker, and sale and other disposition of the large majority of its energy/infrastructure investment portfolio. Due to the long-term duration of many of AIGFP’s derivative contracts and to the complexity of AIGFP’s portfolio, AIG expects that an orderly wind-down will take a substantial period of time. The cost of executing the wind-down will depend on many factors, many of which are not within AIGFP’s control, including market conditions, AIGFP’s access to markets via market counterparties, the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades.     Asset Management     Distressed global markets continue to cause depressed values of assets under management, translating to lower base management fees and continued volatility in unrealized carried interest revenues for Asset Management operations. Current strained economic conditions have caused a decline in the value of certain private equity and real estate assets held for investment purposes resulting in impairment charges. The persistence of the troubled global economy driven by tight credit markets and rising unemployment will likely continue to adversely affect operating income in future periods. Management continues to assess value declines and the permanence of such declines. These market conditions have also adversely affected the ability to pay or refinance maturing debt obligations in the private equity and real estate portfolios.     The criticism and negative publicity about AIG following the events of September 2008 and challenging market conditions have contributed to the loss of institutional and retail clients as well as significant redemptions from certain of AIG’s managed hedge and mutual funds. Client losses and redemptions have leveled off from the fourth quarter of 2008 as markets began to show signs of stabilization in the second quarter of 2009. AIG’s third party Institutional Asset Management business is not expected to launch any new funds or products in the foreseeable future.     Within the Spread-Based Investment business, distressed markets have resulted in continued loss of value of AIG’s invested assets.      Results of Operations      AIG identifies its operating segments by product line, consistent with its management structure. These segments are General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG’s Other category consists of items not allocated to AIG’s operating segments.     AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. AIG’s Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals.    110    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Consolidated Results       AIG’s consolidated results of operations were as follows:                                                                                          Three Months Ended        Percentage        Six Months Ended        Percentage            June 30,       Increase        June 30,       Increase            2009       2008       (Decrease)       2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Revenues:                                                       Premiums and other considerations      $   17,769       $   21,735         (18   )%     $   36,589       $   42,407         (14   )%      Net investment income        8,785         6,728         31         11,068         11,682         (5   )      Net realized capital losses        (1,299   )       (6,081   )       —         (4,401   )       (12,170   )       —        Unrealized market valuation gains (losses) on AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio        636         (5,565   )       —         184         (14,672   )       —        Other income        3,634         3,116         17         6,543         6,717         (3   )                                                          Total revenues        29,525         19,933         48         49,983         33,964         47                                                            Benefits, claims and expenses:                                                       Policyholder benefits and claims incurred        17,273         18,450         (6   )       33,316         34,332         (3   )      Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses        5,694         6,029         (6   )       10,988         11,641         (6   )      Interest expense        2,600         1,333         95         5,445         2,605         109        Restructuring expenses and related asset impairment and other expenses        343         —         —         705         —         —        Other expenses        2,296         2,877         (20   )       4,578         5,406         (15   )                                                          Total benefits, claims and expenses        28,206         28,689         (2   )       55,032         53,984         2                                                            Income (Loss) before income tax benefit        1,319         (8,756   )       —         (5,049   )       (20,020   )       —        Income tax benefit        (526   )       (3,357   )       —         (1,761   )       (6,894   )       —                                                            Net income (loss)        1,845         (5,399   )       —         (3,288   )       (13,126   )       —        Less: Net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest        23         (42   )       —         (757   )       36         —                                                            Net income (loss) attributable to AIG      $   1,822       $   (5,357   )       —   %     $   (2,531   )     $   (13,162   )       —   %                                                             Premiums and Other Considerations     Premiums and other considerations decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:              •   a decline in Commercial Insurance reflecting the economy’s continued effect on the construction, environmental and transportation lines of businesses which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects and a decline in the workers’ compensation line of business due to lower payrolls and AIG’s strategy to remain price disciplined in this business;         •   a decrease in Foreign General Insurance due to negative effect of foreign exchange, the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008 and lower premiums in Europe, the U.K. and Far East regions;      111    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   a decrease in Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services reflecting significant declines in the single premium production which continues to reflect the effect of equity markets on investment-linked and annuity products globally; and         •   a decrease in Domestic Life Insurance premiums, most notably for payout annuities.

Policyholder trading losses are offset by a change in policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets, principally in Japan and Asia;         •   a gain of $1.0 billion for the second quarter of 2009 associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML III, reported in fixed maturities and reflected in the Other category in AIG’s segment results; and         •   lower levels of trading account losses for the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services business in the U.K. associated with certain investment-linked products.       These increases were partially offset by:              •   losses from partnership investments reflecting weaker market conditions in 2009 than in 2008;         •   losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) of $105 million in 2009, reported in fixed maturities and reflected in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment results;      112    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   lower levels of invested assets in 2009 compared to 2008; and         •   lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments for liquidity purposes.       Net investment income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to:              •   losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML III of $939 million in 2009;         •   losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML II of approximately $340 million in 2009;         •   losses from partnership investments reflecting significantly weaker market conditions in 2009 than in 2008;         •   lower levels of invested assets in 2009 compared to 2008; and         •   lower returns as a result of increased levels of short-term investments for liquidity purposes.       These declines were partially offset by increased policyholder trading gains (losses) for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services, which were $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to $(156) million for the same period in 2008.

Additionally, the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008 included non-credit impairments (i.e. severity losses) that are no longer required for fixed maturity securities upon the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2. See Note 35 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Investments — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. Net realized capital losses also decreased due to favorable effect of foreign exchange transactions, which was offset by the effect of derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133.     Unrealized Market Valuation Gains (Losses) on AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio     AIGFP reported unrealized market valuation gains related to its super senior credit default swap portfolio of $636 million and $184 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, and unrealized market valuation losses of $5.6 billion and $14.7 billion in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2008,    113    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     respectively. The change in the unrealized market valuation gains (losses) related to AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio was due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 associated with the ML III transaction as well as the narrowing of corporate credit spreads. Changes in fair value of AIG’s interest in ML III are recorded in Net investment income. See Financial Services Operations — Capital Markets Results; Critical Accounting Estimates — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities; Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2008 Financial Statements.     Other Income (Loss)     Other income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, which was driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies during the second quarter of 2009. This increase was partially offset by a decline in Institutional Asset Management revenues, primarily resulting from real estate equity losses, including the effect of investment impairments and lower base management fees. Other income for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was essentially unchanged compared to the same period in 2008.     Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred     Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 due to lower claims expense in the General Insurance segment. Declines in production levels, the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008, the effect of foreign exchange rates and the deconsolidation of Transatlantic contributed to these declines.     Policy Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses     Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a $243 million decrease in General Insurance expenses reflecting a decline in production levels and a decrease of $192 million due to the deconsolidation of Transatlantic and disposition of HSB. These declines were partially offset by a $242 million increase in policy acquisition and other insurance expenses for Life Insurance and Retirement Services primarily due to deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) amortization related to net realized capital gains (losses) of $141 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to a DAC benefit of $180 million for the same period in 2008.     Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a $314 million decrease in General Insurance expenses reflecting a decline in production levels and a decrease of $228 million due to the deconsolidation of Transatlantic and disposition of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB). These declines were partially offset by a $338 million increase in policy acquisition and other insurance expenses for Life Insurance & Retirement Services primarily due to higher DAC unlockings of $377 million related to changes in the long-term separate account growth rate assumption for Domestic Retirement Services and restructuring costs, partially offset by a higher DAC benefit of $94 million related to net realized capital losses.     Interest Expense     Interest expense increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to $1.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of interest expense on the FRBNY Facility which was comprised of $822 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, of amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset and $552 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, of accrued compounding interest. These amounts are reflected in the Other category in AIG’s segment results.     Restructuring Expenses and Related Asset Impairment and Other Expenses     In the fourth quarter of 2008, AIG commenced an organization-wide restructuring plan under which some of its businesses are being divested, some will be held for later divestiture, some are being prepared for potential offerings to the public and some will be retained. In connection with activities under this plan, AIG recorded    114    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     restructuring and separation expenses of $343 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, consisting of severance expenses of $43 million, contract termination expenses of $19 million, asset write-downs of $10 million, other exit expenses of $146 million and separation expenses of $125 million. AIG recorded restructuring and separation expenses of $705 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, consisting of severance expenses of $81 million, contract termination expenses of $39 million, asset write-downs of $21 million, other exit expenses of $281 million, and separation expenses of $283 million.     Other exit expenses primarily include professional fees related to (i) disposition activities, (ii) AIG’s capital restructuring program with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury and (iii) unwinding of AIGFP’s businesses and portfolios.     Severance and separation expenses described above include retention awards of $120 million and $281 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, to key employees to maintain ongoing business operations and facilitate the successful execution of the restructuring and asset disposition plan. The awards under these retention plans were granted in 2008 and are accrued ratably over the future service periods, which range from 2008 to 2011. The total amount expected to be incurred related to these 2008 retention plans is approximately $1.1 billion. AIG made payments to the employees under these plans in 2008 and the first six months of 2009 and expects to make further payments for the remainder of 2009 through 2011. The ultimate amount paid could be less primarily due to the effect of forfeitures.     Amounts charged to expense, and expected to be charged to expense, and the total amounts expected to be incurred under the 2008 retention plans, by operating segment, are as follows:                                                                                          General        Life Insurance &        Financial        Asset                        Insurance       Retirement Services       Services       Management       Other       Total           (In millions)            Amounts charged to expense:                                                       Three months ended June 30, 2009      $   40       $   33       $   33       $   6       $   8       $   120        Six months ended June 30, 2009        69         78         91         15         28         281        Cumulative incurred since inception of restructuring plan*        152         131         378         62         101         824        Amounts expected to be incurred in future periods:                                                       Remainder of 2009        64         62         93         13         17         249        2010        —         16         —         —         2         18        2011        —         1         —         —         —         1                                                            Total amounts expected to be incurred in future periods        64         79         93         13         19         268                                                            Total amounts expected to be incurred      $   216       $   210       $   471       $   75       $   120       $   1,092                                                                         *    Includes an adjustment of $51 million in Financial Services to increase the cumulative amount incurred since inception for retention amounts paid in 2008.      Total restructuring and separation expenses could have a material effect on future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.     See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses.     Other Expenses     Other Expenses decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in compensation-related costs in the Financial Services and Asset Management segments and lower interest expense on GICs.    115    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Income Taxes (Benefits)     The effective tax rate on pre-tax income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 was (40.0) percent. The effective tax rate was negative because AIG recorded a tax benefit on pre-tax income. The tax benefit was due primarily to a $1.8 billion decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from the effects of recently announced transactions, including the sale of AIG’s headquarters building in Tokyo. This benefit was partially offset by $720 million of deferred tax expense mainly attributable to the book and tax basis differences of AIG Parent’s investment in subsidiaries, primarily attributable to AIG’s divestiture plan, and an increase of $360 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions and other discrete period items. The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was 34.9 percent.     At June 30, 2009, AIG has recorded a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $12.8 billion. This asset was net of $4.2 billion of net deferred tax liabilities related to foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. Management determined that it is more likely than not that the remaining $17.0 billion net deferred tax asset is realizable. AIG has also determined that no valuation allowance is required on $4.3 billion of tax benefit on available for sale fixed maturity securities that management has asserted it has the ability and intent to hold to recovery. The remaining $12.7 billion of net deferred tax asset is supported based on management’s assessment of future income, principally related to AIG’s divestiture plan.     Realization of AIG’s net deferred tax asset depends on AIG’s ability to consummate the AIA and ALICO transactions and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred.     Estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or its results of operations.     When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at June 30, 2009, AIG considered all available evidence, including (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed to date and additional actions expected to be completed, (iii) the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (iv) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving greater weight to discrete sources and to earlier years in the forecast period, and (v) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate taxable amounts. Management has also considered the period during which it expects to receive support from the FRBNY.     The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2008 was 38.4 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to tax benefits from foreign operations and tax exempt interest. The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 was 34.4 percent. The effective tax rate was adversely affected by $703 million of tax charges from the first three months of 2008, comprised of increases in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, tax benefits from foreign operations and tax exempt income and other discrete period items.     See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance.    116    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Segment Results          The following table summarizes the operations of each operating segment.

For the three-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the effect was $167 million and $272 million, respectively, in both revenues and operating income (loss). For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the effect was $881 million and $(476) million, respectively, in both revenues and operating income (loss). These amounts result primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives that are effective economic hedges of investments and borrowings.      (b)    Includes other-than-temporary impairment charges. See also Invested Assets — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments for further discussion.      (c)    In order to better align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG’s chief operating decision makers manage their businesses, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the results for Transatlantic, Personal Lines, Mortgage Guaranty and HSB are now included in AIG’s Other operations.

Prior period amounts have been revised to      117    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries               conform to the current presentation. As a result of dispositions, only Mortgage Guaranty is expected to report ongoing results of operations commencing in the third quarter of 2009.      (d)    Includes gains (losses) from hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For the three-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the effect was $235 million and $5 million, respectively, in both revenues and operating income (loss). For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the effect was $232 million and $(199) million, respectively, in both revenues and operating income (loss). These amounts result primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives that are effective economic hedges of investments and borrowings.      (e)    Includes unrealized market valuation gains of $636 million and losses of $5.6 billion for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and gains of $184 million and losses of $14.7 billion for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio.       General Insurance Operations      AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad.     Commercial Insurance writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides Commercial Insurance the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to Commercial Insurance without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit Commercial Insurance to accept a risk.     AIG’s Foreign General insurance group writes both commercial and consumer lines of insurance through a network of branches and foreign based insurance subsidiaries. Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. Foreign General insurance group operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, the U.K., Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.     In order to better align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG’s chief operating decision makers manage their businesses, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the results for Transatlantic, Personal Lines (excluding the results of the Private Client Group), and Mortgage Guaranty, previously reported as part of the General Insurance operating segment, are now included in AIG’s Other operations.

The combined ratio for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the loss ratio. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 was 2.6 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the three-month period ended June 30, 2008 due to premium rate decreases and changes in loss trends. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $60 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 and increased incurred losses by $73 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2008. The net adverse development for the three-month period 2009 includes $71 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies. The favorable development related to loss sensitive policies had no effect on underwriting profit as it was entirely offset by a decline in earned premiums.     General Insurance net premiums written decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Net premiums written were impacted by foreign exchange rates, the U.S. construction, environmental and transportation lines of business, which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects, and a decline in U.S. workers’ compensation premiums due to lower payrolls and a strategy to remain price disciplined. General Insurance net premiums written also declined due to the previous sale of the Brazilian operations.     Year-to-Date General Insurance Results     General Insurance operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to a decline in underwriting income, a decline in net investment income, partially offset by lower net realized capital losses. The combined ratio for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to an increase in the loss ratio. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was 2.0 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 due to premium rate decreases and changes in loss trends. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $232 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 and decreased incurred losses by $152 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008. The net adverse development for 2009 includes $171 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies compared to $339 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies in the same period in 2008. The favorable development related to loss sensitive policies had no effect on underwriting profit as it was entirely offset by a decline in earned premiums.     General Insurance net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Net premiums written were affected by foreign exchange rates, the U.S. construction, real estate and transportation lines of business, which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects, and a decline in U.S. workers’ compensation premiums due to lower payrolls and a strategy to remain price disciplined. General Insurance net premiums written also declined due to the previous sale of the Brazilian operations.

Quarterly Commercial Insurance Results     Commercial Insurance operating income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 mainly due to an increase in net investment income and lower other-than-temporary impairment charges on invested assets.     Commercial Insurance net premiums written decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to the economy’s continued effect on the construction, real estate and transportation lines of businesses, which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new    121    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     projects, and a decline in the workers’ compensation line of business due to lower payrolls and a strategy to remain price disciplined.     The loss ratio recorded in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 was 3.2 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the three-month period ended June 30, 2008 due to premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends. Net prior year development increased incurred losses by $62 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 and increased incurred losses by $72 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2008. The net adverse development for 2009 includes $71 million of favorable development related to loss sensitive policies. The favorable development related to loss sensitive policies had no effect on underwriting profit as it was entirely offset by a decline in earned premiums.     The expense ratio increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 driven by the decline in premiums. Overall expenses were down $156 million, or 14 percent from prior year due to continued expense saving initiatives, partially offset by higher pension costs.     Year-to-Date Commercial Insurance Results     Commercial Insurance operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 mainly due to a decrease in underwriting income, and a decline in net investment income, partially offset by lower net realized capital losses.     Net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to declines in workers’ compensation premiums and the construction, real estate and transportation lines of businesses as described above. Net premiums written were also adversely affected by AIG’s negative publicity in the current year.     The loss ratio recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. The loss ratio for accident year 2009 recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was 1.6 points higher than the loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 due to premium rate decreases and adverse changes in loss trends. The loss ratio for accident year 2008 recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 included a 1.4 point effect related to the Atlanta tornado and Midwest flood catastrophe losses. Prior year development increased incurred losses by $226 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 and reduced incurred losses by $136 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008. The net adverse development includes favorable development related to loss sensitive policies of $171 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 and $339 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008.     The expense ratio increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 driven by the decline in premiums. Overall expenses were down $188 million, or 8 percent from prior year due to continued expense saving initiatives, partially offset by higher pension costs and other restructuring costs.

The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Foreign General Insurance net premiums written:                                                                  Three Months        Six Months            Ended        Ended            June 30,       June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008            Growth in original currency*        (13.3   )%       5.3   %       (11.7   )%       8.1   %      Foreign exchange effect        (7.4   )       9.6         (7.6   )       9.5                                            Growth as reported in U.S. dollars        (20.7   )%       14.9   %       (19.3   )%       17.6   %                                                       *    Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.     122    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Quarterly Foreign General Insurance Results     Foreign General Insurance operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due a decline in underwriting profit and decrease in interest income reflecting lower yields and lower partnership income related to lower IPO activity and weaker performance in the equity markets.     Net premiums written decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The effect of foreign exchange contributed to 7.4 percent of this decline and the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008 contributed to 6.7 percent of the decline. Approximately one-half of the decline in net premiums written was due to the negative effect of the economic downturn and customer de-risking most notably seen in the deterioration of new business across casualty and financial lines primarily in Europe and the U.K. The consumer lines business was affected by the continued global recessionary pressure reducing the number of overseas travelers and auto sales, particularly in the Far East region.     The loss ratio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. This is primarily due to claim increases in the financial institutions professional indemnity book as a result of stock market declines and claims related to credit and fraud exposure and major aviation losses.     The expense ratio increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to increased separation costs, restructuring charges, bad debt expenses and decreased earned premiums.     Year-to-Date Foreign General Insurance Results     Foreign General Insurance operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in underwriting profit as well as a decrease in net investment income reflecting lower interest income and partnership income related to continued weak performance in the equity markets.     Net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The effect of foreign exchange contributed to 7.6 percent of this decline and the sale of the Brazilian operations in 2008 contributed to 6.2 percent of the decline. The Europe region maintained strong client and policy retention in the second quarter and continues to return to historical levels. In the Far East operations, the economic downturn continued to negatively affect new business in the consumer lines portfolio.     The loss ratio in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 reflecting claim increases in the financial institutions professional indemnity book as a result of stock market declines, continued exposure to credit and fraud claims along with higher claims frequency in major markets.     The expense ratio increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to increased separation costs, restructuring charges, bad debt expenses and decreased earned premiums.      Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense      The following discussion on the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for the Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance reporting units in the General Insurance operating segment and loss reserves pertaining to divested and/or noncore businesses, comprising the Transatlantic, Personal Lines and Mortgage Guaranty reporting units reported in AIG’s Other category.    123    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents the components of the loss reserves by major lines of business on a statutory annual statement basis(a):                                          June 30,        December 31,              2009       2008           (In millions)            Other liability occurrence      $   19,299       $   19,773        Workers’ compensation        14,566         15,170        Other liability claims made        12,122         13,189        International        11,898         11,786        Auto liability        5,099         5,593        Property        4,030         5,201        Mortgage Guaranty/Credit        4,545         3,137        Reinsurance        133         3,102        Products liability        2,317         2,400        Medical malpractice        1,601         2,210        Aircraft        1,406         1,693        Accident and health        1,546         1,451        Commercial multiple peril        1,058         1,163        Fidelity/surety        799         1,028        Other        1,669         2,362                            Total(b)      $   82,088       $   89,258                                         (a)    Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.      (b)    The decrease from the December 31, 2008 loss reserve amount was primarily due to the deconsolidation of Transatlantic.      AIG’s gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves (IBNR) and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are currently reflected in operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.     Estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, based upon historical reporting trends. Mortgage Guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability (for each delinquent loan reported) that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency, cure rates, dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan. Because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events, such as changes in home price appreciation or depreciation, interest rates and unemployment, the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment. AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans. Consistent with industry practice, AIG does not establish a reserve for insured loans that are not currently delinquent, but that may become delinquent in future periods.     At June 30, 2009, net loss reserves decreased $6.69 billion from the prior year-end to $65.77 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.    124    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table classifies the components of the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense by business unit:                                          June 30,        December 31,            2009       2008           (In millions)            General Insurance segment:                       Commercial Insurance(a)      $   48,484       $   48,896        Foreign General Insurance        11,548         10,853                            Total General Insurance        60,032         59,749                            Noncore businesses:                       Transatlantic(b)        —         7,349        21st Century(a)(b)        1,819         2,065        Mortgage Guaranty        3,919         3,004        HSB(b)        —         288                            Total noncore businesses        5,738         12,706                            Total net loss reserves      $   65,770       $   72,455                                         (a)    December 31, 2008 balances have been revised to reclassify Private Client Group into Commercial Insurance.      (b)    Transatlantic was deconsolidated during the second quarter of 2009, 21st Century was sold on July 1, 2009 and HSB was sold during the first quarter of 2009.      Discounting of Reserves     At June 30, 2009, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.57 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in AIRCO that was written by Commercial Insurance is discounted based on the yield of Department of the Treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the Commercial Insurance payout pattern for this business. The discount is comprised of the following: $733 million — tabular discount for workers’ compensation in Commercial Insurance; $1.69 billion — non-tabular discount for workers’ compensation in Commercial Insurance; $150 million — non-tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO for Commercial Insurance business; and $83 million pertaining to certain long-term environmental liabilities in Commercial Insurance. Since 1998, AIRCO has assumed on a quota share basis certain general liability and products liability business written by Commercial Insurance, and the reserves for this business are carried on a discounted basis by AIRCO.     Quarterly Reserving Process     AIG believes that the net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of June 30, 2009. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s loss reserves as of June 30, 2009. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated financial condition, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.    125    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves:                                                                  Three Months Ended        Six Months Ended            June 30,       June 30,             2009       2008       2009       2008           (In millions)            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year      $   72,254       $   70,507       $   72,455       $   69,288        Foreign exchange effect        1,080         193         790         263        Dispositions*        (7,551   )       —         (7,838   )       —                                            Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                       Current year        6,932         8,620         14,798         16,641        Prior years, other than accretion of discount        272         93         336         (71   )      Prior years, accretion of discount        98         72         196         176                                            Losses and loss expenses incurred        7,302         8,785         15,330         16,746                                            Losses and loss expenses paid        7,315         7,154         14,967         13,966                                            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period      $   65,770         72,331       $   65,770       $   72,331                                                         *    Transatlantic was deconsolidated during the second quarter of 2009 and HSB was sold during the first quarter of 2009.

For example, if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years, AIG’s actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the profit center’s reserves for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center, as appropriate, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.     2009 Net Loss Development     In the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years was adverse by approximately $60 million excluding approximately $98 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. The overall General Insurance adverse development of approximately $60 million included approximately $160 million of adverse development relating to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance, primarily from accident years 2004 through 2006. Offsetting the excess casualty adverse development within Commercial Insurance was approximately $160 million of favorable development from Lexington Insurance Company’s (Lexington) healthcare, CAT excess, and casualty businesses. The Commercial Insurance overall adverse development in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 also included approximately $40 million of adverse development pertaining to asbestos, largely attributable to one defendant, and approximately $40 million of adverse development pertaining to property business relating primarily to the 2008 hurricanes Ike and Gustav, and approximately $50 million from a variety of other classes of business. The Commercial Insurance overall adverse development also includes approximately $70 million of favorable development pertaining to loss sensitive business; however the Commercial Insurance underwriting results did not benefit from this $70 million as it was offset by a corresponding $70 million reduction to net earned premiums The AIG total net loss development from prior accident years for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, including noncore businesses, was approximately $272 million. The noncore businesses prior year development includes approximately $222 million of adverse development from Mortgage Guaranty, with approximately $160 million of this amount pertaining to accident year 2008 and $76 million to accident year 2007, partially offset by a modest amount of favorable development from earlier accident years.     In the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, General Insurance net loss development from prior accident years was adverse by approximately $232 million excluding approximately $196 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. The General Insurance overall adverse development of $232 million included approximately $330 million relating to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance, partially offset by approximately   127    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     $230 million of favorable development pertaining to Lexington’s healthcare, CAT excess, and casualty businesses. The General Insurance overall adverse development of $232 million also included approximately $80 million pertaining to a surety claim and an additional $80 million pertaining to a reinsurance commutation, both of which occurred in the first three months of 2009 within Commercial Insurance. Also included in the overall development was approximately $90 million of adverse development from property business within Commercial Insurance, largely relating to prior accident year hurricanes. The Commercial Insurance overall adverse development of approximately $226 million included approximately $170 million of favorable development relating to loss sensitive business; however the Commercial Insurance underwriting result did not benefit from this $170 million as it was offset by a corresponding $170 million reduction to net earned premiums. The excess casualty adverse development of approximately $330 million arose from accident year 2006 and prior, and was attributable to loss emergence significantly in excess of the historical loss emergence pattern for this class of business. The Lexington favorable development of approximately $230 million was related primarily to accident years 2002 through 2007, and was attributable to continued favorable loss emergence and loss trends for these accident years. The AIG total net loss development from prior accident years for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, including noncore businesses, was adverse by approximately $336 million. Mortgage Guaranty accounted for approximately $129 million of adverse development, consisting of approximately $22 million of adverse development relating to accident year 2008 and approximately $111 million of adverse development from accident year 2007, partially offset by a modest amount of favorable development from earlier accident years.     2008 Net Loss Development      In the three-month period ended June 30, 2008, net loss development from prior accident years was adverse by approximately $93 million, excluding approximately $72 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. The overall adverse development of $93 million consisted of approximately $292 million of favorable development from accident years 2004 through 2007 offset by approximately $385 million of adverse loss development from accident years 2003 and prior. The adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior was primarily related to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance. The favorable development from accident years 2004 through 2007 included approximately $80 million of favorable development from business written by Lexington, including Healthcare and Casualty and Program businesses. AIG Executive Liability business contributed approximately $65 million to the favorable development from accident years 2004 and 2005, relating primarily to D&O. Within Commercial Insurance, the overall adverse development of approximately $75 million consisted of approximately $160 million of adverse development relating to excess casualty business and approximately $50 million of adverse development relating to property business, partially offset by favorable development from D&O, healthcare and other classes. A significant portion of the adverse development relating to excess casualty was related to a variety of latent exposures, including construction defect exposures, product aggregate exposure and pharmaceutical related exposures, as well as a significant number of other large losses primarily from accident years 1998 through 2002. In addition, the loss development assumptions applicable to excess casualty reserves were modified in the second quarter of 2008 to reflect the adverse experience being observed, and this caused approximately $90 million of the overall adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior. Excess casualty results for the more recent accident years, i.e. 2004 and subsequent years, has continued to be favorable. AIG’s exposure to these latent exposures was reduced after 2002 due to significant changes in policy terms and conditions as well as underwriting guidelines.     In the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, net loss development from prior accident years was favorable by approximately $71 million, including approximately $339 million of favorable development relating to loss sensitive business in the first three months of 2008 (which was offset by an equal amount of negative earned premium development), and excluding approximately $176 million from accretion of loss reserve discount. Excluding both the favorable development relating to loss sensitive business and accretion of loss reserve discount, net loss development from prior accident years in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, was adverse by approximately $268 million. The overall favorable development of approximately $71 million consisted of approximately $841 million of favorable development from accident years 2004 through 2007 partially offset by approximately $770 million of adverse loss development from accident years 2003 and prior. Excluding the favorable development from loss sensitive business, the overall adverse development of approximately $268 million consisted of approximately $561 million of favorable development from accident years 2004 through 2007 offset by    128    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     approximately $829 million of adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior. The adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior was primarily related to excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance. The favorable development from accident years 2004 through 2007 included approximately $280 million in favorable development from loss sensitive business written by AIG Risk Management, and approximately $220 million in favorable development from business written by Lexington, including Healthcare, AIG CAT Excess, Casualty and Program businesses. AIG Executive Liability business contributed approximately $110 million to the favorable development from accident years 2004 and 2005, relating primarily to D&O. The adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior included approximately $200 million related to claims involving MTBE, a gasoline additive, primarily on excess casualty business within Commercial Insurance from accident years 2000 and prior. In addition, as described above for the three months ended June 30, 2008, the excess casualty adverse developments reflect a variety of other latent claims and large losses, as well as an approximately $90 million increase resulting from the modification of loss development factors to reflect adverse experience in excess casualty.     Asbestos and Environmental Reserves     The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.     As described more fully in the 2008 Form 10-K, AIG’s reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the table that follows. This development was primarily attributable to several large defendants.    129    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined appears in the table below. The vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years. The current environmental policies that AIG underwrites on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the table below.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The June 30, 2009 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at June 30, 2008 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. In addition, AIG’s survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at June 30, 2009 by approximately 1.0 years and 2.1 years, respectively, and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at June 30, 2008 by approximately 1.4 years and 3.0 years, respectively. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG’s determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.     AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three-year average payment and were as follows:                                       Six Months Ended June 30,      Gross       Net            2009                       Survival ratios:                       Asbestos        4.8         3.7        Environmental        4.5         3.4        Combined        4.8         3.6                            2008                       Survival ratios:                       Asbestos        5.7         4.3        Environmental        4.5         3.7        Combined        5.5         4.2                                Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations      AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad.

Year-to-Date Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Results      Total revenues for Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses along with higher policyholder trading gains, partially offset by lower premiums and other considerations and the effect of the sale of the Brazil operations. See Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).     Operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 due primarily to lower net realized capital losses and higher DAC and SIA benefits of $369 million related to net realized capital losses in 2009 compared to $57 million in 2008. Other items affecting operating income in the period were:              •   lower U.K. trading losses of $187 million;         •   a $134 million loss recognition charge related to the Philippine operations;         •   lower investment margins due to de-risking activities and higher short-term liquidity;         •   lower assets under management in the U.K., Japan and Asia investment-linked portfolios;         •   the sale of the Brazil operations; and         •   higher expenses due to restructuring charges.

Life insurance sales of investment-linked products in Asia were adversely affected by equity market performance and the negative effect of foreign exchange. Life insurance sales in Japan increased as a result of sales incentives, while personal accident sales declined.     Single premium sales in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 declined significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower guaranteed income bond deposits in the U.K. resulting from poor market conditions and the effect of the adverse publicity surrounding AIG. Single premium sales in Asia improved during the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 but remained at depressed levels compared to the same period in 2008 due to equity markets performance.     Annuity deposits decreased significantly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the decline in individual variable annuity deposits. Investment-linked deposits in the U.K. decreased significantly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 resulting from declines in the U.K. Premier Access Bond product following significant surrender activity as a result of the AIG issues. Adverse publicity surrounding AIG and the planned disposition of AIG’s Japan life operations continued to negatively affect deposits in Japan during the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 due to the suspension of sales by banks. While some banks in Japan have resumed sales of annuity products, most have not. AIG has, therefore, focused its efforts to sell annuity deposit products through agents.     Year-to-Date Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services Sales and Deposits      First year premium sales in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 declined compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to decreases in life insurance and personal accident sales. Life insurance sales of investment-linked products in Asia were adversely affected by equity market performance and the negative effect of foreign exchange. Life insurance sales in Japan increased as a result of sales incentives and the positive effect of foreign exchange while personal accident sales declined.     Single premium sales in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 declined significantly compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower guaranteed income bond deposits in the U.K. resulting from poor market conditions and the effect of the adverse publicity surrounding AIG. Single premium sales also decreased in Asia as customers remained concerned about equity markets performance, particularly in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.     Annuity deposits decreased significantly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to the decline in individual variable annuity deposits in the U.K. and individual fixed annuity deposits in Japan. Investment-linked deposits in the U.K. decreased significantly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 resulting from declines in the U.K. Premier Access Bond product following significant surrender activity as a result of the AIG issues. Adverse publicity surrounding AIG and the planned disposition of AIG’s Japan life operations continued to negatively affect deposits in Japan during the first six months of 2009 due to the suspension of sales by banks. While some banks in Japan have resumed sales of annuity products, most have not. AIG has, therefore, focused its efforts to sell annuity deposit products through agents.    138    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Domestic Life

Insurance increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to net realized capital gains of $214 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to losses of $1.4 billion in 2008, partially offset by lower net investment income and lower premiums and other considerations. See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Premiums and Other Considerations; — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Losses and Investments.     Domestic Life Insurance reported operating income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss in the same period in 2008 due principally to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments and favorable mortality. Operating income was adversely affected by lower net investment income due to reduced overall investment yields from increased levels of short-term investments, lower partnership income and a current period decline of $36 million in fair value of the economic interest in ML II.     Year-to-Date Domestic Life Insurance Results      Total revenues for Domestic Life Insurance increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to considerably lower net realized capital losses.

Operating income was adversely affected by lower net investment income due to reduced overall investment yields from increased levels of short-term investments and a current period decline of $118 million in fair value of the economic interest in ML II.    140    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Domestic Life Insurance Sales and Deposits     Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits by product* were as follows:                                                                                          Three Months              Six Months                  Ended        Percentage        Ended        Percentage            June 30,       Increase/        June 30,       Increase/            2009       2008       (Decrease)       2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Life insurance                                                       Periodic premium by product:                                                       Universal life      $   16       $   46         (65   )%     $   30       $   93         (68   )%      Variable universal life        1         12         (92   )       8         33         (76   )      Term life        18         58         (69   )       41         107         (62   )      Whole life/other        1         1         —         1         2         (50   )                                                          Total periodic premiums by product        36         117         (69   )       80         235         (66   )      Unscheduled and single deposits        17         105         (84   )       50         160         (69   )                                                          Total life insurance        53         222         (76   )       130         395         (67   )                                                          Home service                                                       Life insurance and accident and health        21         24         (13   )       38         44         (14   )      Fixed annuities        41         40         3         97         69         41        Unscheduled and single deposits        5         5         —         9         10         (10   )                                                          Total home service        67         69         (3   )       144         123         17                                                            Group life/health        11         26         (58   )       45         63         (29   )      Payout annuities        227         549         (59   )       435         1,122         (61   )      Individual fixed and runoff annuities        199         255         (22   )       394         337         17                                                            Total sales and deposits      $   557       $   1,121         (50   )%     $   1,148       $   2,040         (44   )%                                                                       *    Excludes divested operations. Life insurance sales include periodic premium from new business expected to be collected over a one-year period and unscheduled and single premiums from new and existing policyholders. Sales of group accident and health insurance represent annualized first year premium from new policies. Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing policyholders.      Total Domestic Life Insurance sales and deposits decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to lower payout annuities and life insurance premiums. Payout annuities sales and life insurance premiums decreased primarily due to AIG’s lower ratings and negative publicity.    141    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and

Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Quarterly Domestic Retirement Services Results      Domestic Retirement Services reported significantly lower operating losses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses principally due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges as well as a $174 million increase in gains from embedded policy derivative liability valuations, net of related economic hedges, due to improved equity market conditions. The results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2008 included impairments of $1.9 billion related to AIG’s U.S. securities lending program which was terminated in December 2008.     These increases were partially offset by higher DAC and SIA amortization relating to net realized capital gains of $202 million for individual variable annuities. In addition, for group retirement products and individual fixed annuities, DAC and SIA benefits relating to net realized capital losses were lower in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 by $50 million and $111 million, respectively, compared to the same period last year. DAC charges for individual fixed annuities related to projected increases in surrenders totaled $43 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. Current period results were also negatively affected by the $66 million decline in the fair value of the economic interest in ML II, increased levels of short-term investments and lower assets under management. See Consolidated Results — Net Investment Income; and — Net Realized Capital Losses for further discussion.     Year-to-Date Domestic Retirement Services Results      Domestic Retirement Services reported lower operating losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to considerably lower net realized capital losses arising principally from lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and a $366 million decrease in the fair value of embedded policy derivative liabilities, net of related economic hedges, driven by improved equity market conditions. The results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 included impairments of $3.3 billion related to AIG’s U.S. securities lending program which was terminated in December 2008.     The improvement in operating income was partially offset by losses on partnership investments principally related to the private equity portfolio, lower yield enhancement income and higher DAC and SIA amortization charges relating to net realized capital gains of $242 million for individual variable annuities. DAC and SIA benefits for group retirement products and individual fixed annuities relating to net realized capital losses were $148 million and $150 million, respectively, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to $89 million and $240 million, respectively, for the same period in 2008. DAC and SIA unlocking and related reserve strengthening due to deteriorating equity market conditions and reductions in long-term growth rate assumptions for group retirement products and individual variable annuities totaled $78 million and $480 million, respectively, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009. DAC charges for individual fixed annuities related to projected increases in surrenders totaled $43 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009. Current year results were also negatively affected by a $214 million decline in the fair value of the economic interest in ML II, increased levels of short-term investments and lower assets under management.

                            Deposits in all three product lines have been negatively affected by lower AIG ratings and continued negative AIG publicity. For individual variable annuities, the decrease is also attributable to the decline in equity markets since March 2008 and a general decline in industry sales volumes. Individual fixed and variable annuity sales have decreased due to the temporary suspension of product sales at certain large selling organizations due to the effect of the AIG events.     Surrender rates and other withdrawals increased for group retirement products and individual variable and fixed annuities in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to the AIG ratings downgrades and negative publicity about AIG. However, surrender rates and net flows have continued to improve in all three product lines from the fourth quarter of 2008. Surrender rates for group retirement products are expected to increase in the second half of 2009 as several large group surrenders are anticipated.   145    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents Domestic Retirement Services reserves by surrender charge category and surrender rates:                                                      Group        Individual        Individual            Retirement        Fixed        Variable         At June 30,      Products*       Annuities       Annuities           (In millions)            2009                               No surrender charge      $   43,592       $   10,094       $   9,234        0% — 2%        1,792         2,931         3,308        Greater than 2% — 4%        1,894         6,559         2,103        Greater than 4%        3,099         23,331         6,930        Non-Surrenderable        914         3,209         1,026                                    Total Reserves      $   51,291       $   46,124       $   22,601                                    Surrender rates        12.0   %       19.6   %       13.1   %                                  2008                               No surrender charge      $   48,399       $   11,465       $   12,288        0% — 2%        2,659         3,519         4,545        Greater than 2% — 4%        3,309         7,325         4,002        Greater than 4%        2,621         26,441         9,524        Non-Surrenderable        888         3,327         308                                    Total Reserves      $   57,876       $   52,077       $   30,667                                    Surrender rates        8.4   %       11.8   %       12.0   %                                               *    Excludes mutual funds of $7.0 billion and $8.3 billion at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.       Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Sales Inducement Assets      DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period in accordance with FAS 60, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises.” Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment-type products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts in accordance with FAS 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains from the Sale of Investments.” Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet with DAC and amortized over the life of the business similar to DAC. AIG offers sales inducements to contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contracts. Sales inducements are recognized as an asset (SIA) with a corresponding increase to the liability for policyholder contract deposits on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the life of the contract similar to DAC. The deferral of acquisition and sales inducement costs decreased $683 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to declines in new business production. Current year amortization for Domestic Retirement Services also includes charges for DAC and SIA unlocking of $412 million related to a reduction in the long-term separate account growth rate assumption and $43 million related to higher anticipated surrenders for individual fixed annuities. Annualized amortization expense levels in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were approximately 15 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of the opening DAC balance.     AIG adopted FSP FAS 115-2 on April 1, 2009 resulting in a one-time adjustment to the cost basis of affected securities and DAC and SIA charges related to other-than-temporary impairments previously taken. There was no material effect to DAC and SIA assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, because realized capital gains    146    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     and losses are included in the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC for investment-oriented products, DAC amortization is expected to be lower in future periods.

(c)    In 2008, primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of FAS 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (FAS 159).      As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC, VOBA and SIA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.     DAC, VOBA and SIA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG’s DAC, VOBA and SIA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG’s results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.      Financial Services Operations      AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital markets, and consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations.     Aircraft Leasing     AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC’s own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.     Capital Markets     Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engaged as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and interest rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and engages in borrowing activities that involve issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into GIAs. Given the extreme market conditions experienced in 2008, downgrades of AIG’s credit ratings by the rating agencies and AIG’s intent to refocus on its core businesses, in late 2008 AIGFP began to unwind its businesses and portfolios, including those associated with credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities.     Historically, AIG’s Capital Markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. AIGFP has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions. Revenues and operating income of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities and by the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the comparative period.    148    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Consumer Finance     AIG’s Consumer Finance operations in North America are principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives most of its revenues from finance charges assessed on real estate loans, secured and unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables.     AIG’s foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging and developing markets. At June 30, 2009, AIGCFG had operations in Argentina, China, Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, India and Colombia. During the first six months of 2009 and through July 31, 2009, AIG has completed the sale of certain AIGCFG operations in China, Thailand, the Philippines and Mexico. AIG has also entered into contracts to sell certain AIGCFG operations in Argentina, China, Colombia, Poland, Russia, Taiwan and Thailand.

Interest expense on intercompany borrowings and the effect on operating results related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP’s portfolios in 2009 more than offset the unrealized market valuation gains related to AIGFP’s credit default swap portfolios. The operating loss in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 also included a loss of $37 million and a gain of $1.8 billion, respectively, representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities, including a loss of $17 million and a gain of $89 million, respectively, reflected in the unrealized market valuations on the super senior credit default swaps.         •   AGF’s operating loss increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to the 45 percent and 29 percent declines, respectively, in finance charges and other revenues reflecting the sales of real estate portfolios as part of AGF’s liquidity management efforts and increases in the provision for finance receivable losses of $22 million and $208 million,      149    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                respectively, resulting from increases to the allowance for finance receivable losses in response to the higher levels of delinquencies on AGF’s finance receivable portfolio and higher net charge-offs. This decline was partially offset by lower operating expenses and interest expense. AGF’s reduced operating expenses resulted from AGF’s decision to cease its wholesale originations in 2008 and AGF’s branch office closings in 2008 and 2009.                •   ILFC generated strong operating income growth in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008, due to a larger aircraft fleet size and lower composite borrowing rates partially offset by higher depreciation expense, lower flight equipment marketing revenue and an impairment charge of $16 million.       Quarterly Capital Markets Results     AIGFP’s operating loss decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily related to a market valuation gain in 2009 compared to a loss in 2008 on its super senior CDO credit default swap portfolio. AIGFP’s results also reflect the effects of its wind-down activities.     AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $636 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $5.6 billion in 2008, representing the change in fair value of its super senior credit default swap portfolio. The principal components of the valuation gains and losses recognized were as follows:              •   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $284 million in the second quarter of 2009 with respect to credit default swaps (CDS) transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to a $5.6 billion unrealized market valuation loss for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the unrealized market valuation loss on this portfolio was largely due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of CDS contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 in connection with the ML III transaction.         •   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $792 million in the second quarter of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to a $126 million market valuation gain for the same period in 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, the valuation of these contracts benefited from the narrowing of corporate credit spreads, while these spreads also narrowed during the same period in 2008 although to a lesser extent as compared to the same period in 2009.       See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio.     During the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, AIGFP recognized a gain of $105 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio, compared to a net loss of $26 million in the same period of 2008.     During the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, AIGFP incurred an additional charge of $198 million related to a transaction entered into in 2002 whereby AIGFP guaranteed obligations under leases of office space from a counterparty. AIGFP increased its reserve from $158 million as of March 31, 2009 to $356 million as of June 30, 2009.    150    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents AIGFP’s credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) (excluding intercompany transactions):                                            Counterparty Credit        AIG’s Own Credit        Valuation Adjustment on Assets       Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       (In millions)            Three Months Ended June 30, 2009                           Bond trading securities      $   869       Notes and bonds payable     $   (397   )      Loans and other assets        (14   )     Hybrid financial instrument liabilities       (293   )      Derivative assets        361       GIAs       (132   )                 Other liabilities       (47   )                 Derivative liabilities*       (384   )                              Increase in assets      $   1,216       Increase in liabilities     $   (1,253   )                              Net pre-tax decrease to other income      $   (37   )                                          Three Months Ended June 30, 2008                           Bond trading securities      $   (503   )     Notes and bonds payable     $   (79   )      Loans and other assets        (4   )     Hybrid financial instrument liabilities       (47   )      Derivative assets        145       GIAs       (84   )                 Other liabilities       (2   )                 Derivative liabilities*       100                                Decrease in assets      $   (362   )     Increase in liabilities     $   (112   )                              Net pre-tax decrease to other income      $   (474   )                                                       *    Includes super senior credit default swap portfolio.      AIGFP’s operating loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 includes a loss of $37 million representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities, including $17 million of losses reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The loss in the second quarter of 2009 was primarily the result of the narrowing in credit spreads since March 31, 2009, including AIG’s credit spreads.     The operating loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2008 included a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $474 million, and reflected $44 million of gains included in unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. Credit valuation adjustment losses of $362 million on AIGFP assets were primarily due to the widening of credit spreads on CDOs and ABS products, which represented a significant portion of AIGFP’s investment portfolio. Credit spreads on the ABS and CDO investments widened significantly more than the widening in AIG’s credit spreads. Furthermore, while AIG’s credit spreads widened during the second quarter of 2008, the credit valuation adjustment on its liabilities decreased due to a decline in AIGFP’s outstanding debt obligations and the shortened maturity of its liabilities.     Included in AIGFP’s financial results for the second quarter of 2009 is $702 million of interest charges on intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation.     Historically, the most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses was compensation, which was approximately $155 million, or 77 percent of operating expense in the three-month period ended June 30, 2008. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2009, however, compensation expense was approximately $23 million, or only 19 percent of operating expenses. In addition, AIGFP recognized $43 million in expenses related to pre-existing retention plans that were reported as part of restructuring expenses.    151    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Year-to-Date Capital Markets Results     AIGFP’s operating loss decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily related to a reduced valuation loss on its super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio and the positive effect related to credit spreads on the valuation of its assets and liabilities. AIGFP’s results reflect the effects of its wind-down activities.     AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $184 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $14.7 billion in 2008, representing the change in fair value of its super senior credit default swap portfolio. The principal components of the valuation losses recognized were as follows:              •   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation loss of $1.1 billion in the first six-months of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs, compared to $13.6 billion for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the unrealized market valuation loss on this portfolio was largely due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting from the termination of CDS contracts in the fourth quarter of 2008 in connection with the ML III transaction.         •   AIGFP recognized an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.2 billion in the first six-months of 2009 with respect to CDS transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio, compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of $770 million for the same period in 2008. During the first six-months of 2009, the valuation of these contracts benefited from the narrowing of corporate credit spreads, while these spreads widened during the same period in 2008.       See Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities — Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio.     During the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, AIGFP recognized a loss of $119 million on credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits which are not included in the super senior credit default swap portfolio, compared to a net loss of $83 million in the same period of 2008.    152    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents AIGFP’s credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) (excluding intercompany transactions):                                            Counterparty Credit        AIG’s Own Credit        Valuation Adjustment on Assets       Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       (In millions)            Six Months Ended June 30, 2009                           Bond trading securities      $   (262   )     Notes and bonds payable     $   247        Loans and other assets        (62   )     Hybrid financial instrument liabilities       311        Derivative assets        802       GIAs       319                   Other liabilities       57                   Derivative liabilities*       338                                Increase in assets      $   478       Decrease in liabilities     $   1,272                                Net pre-tax increase to other income      $   1,750                                            Six Months Ended June 30, 2008                           Bond trading securities      $   (2,651   )     Notes and bonds payable     $   182        Loans and other assets        (28   )     Hybrid financial instrument liabilities       615        Derivative assets        (303   )     GIAs       1,072                   Other liabilities       28                   Derivative liabilities*       639                                Decrease in assets      $   (2,982   )     Decrease in liabilities     $   2,536                                Net pre-tax decrease to other income      $   (446   )                                                       *    Includes super senior credit default swap portfolio.      AIGFP’s operating loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 includes a gain of $1.8 billion representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities, including $89 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation gain on super senior credit default swaps. The gain in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was primarily the result of significant widening in AIG’s credit spreads since December 31, 2008 and the continued widening of spreads on asset-backed securities and CDOs, which represent a significant segment of AIGFP’s investment portfolio.     For the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 AIGFP’s operating loss included a credit valuation adjustment loss of $446 million representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of AIGFP’s assets and liabilities, including $109 million of credit valuation adjustment gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps. Included in the six-month period ended June 30, 2008 net operating loss is the transition amount of $291 million related to the adoption of FAS 157 and FAS 159, as well as a credit valuation adjustment gain of $193 million for derivatives AIGFP entered into with other AIG entities, which is eliminated in consolidation.     Included in AIGFP’s financial results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 is $1.6 billion of interest charges on intercompany borrowings with AIG that are eliminated in consolidation.     Historically, the most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses was compensation, which was approximately $298 million, or 77 percent of operating expense in the first six months of 2008. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, however, compensation expense was approximately $50 million, or only 18 percent of operating expenses. In addition, AIGFP recognized $87 million in expenses related to pre-existing retention plans that were reported as part of restructuring expenses.    153    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Asset Management Operations      AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products. These services and products are offered to individuals, pension funds and institutions (including AIG subsidiaries) globally through AIG’s Spread-Based Investment business, Institutional Asset Management, and Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds businesses. Also included in Asset Management operations are the results of certain SunAmerica sponsored partnership investments.     The revenues and operating income (loss) for this segment are affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets. In addition, net realized gains and carried interest are contingent upon investment maturity levels and market conditions. In the Institutional Asset Management business, carried interest, computed in accordance with each fund’s governing agreement, is based on the investment’s performance over the life of each fund. Unrealized carried interest is recognized based on each fund’s performance as of the balance sheet date. Future fund performance may negatively affect previously recognized carried interest.     AIG has offered for sale its Institutional Asset Management businesses excluding those investment services providing traditional fixed income and shorter duration asset and liability management for AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries as well as proprietary real estate and private equity investments. AIG expects to continue relationships with any divested businesses for other investment management services used by those insurance company subsidiaries.     See the 2008 Form 10-K for a further description of the Asset Management businesses.

Offsetting these improvements were higher losses on equity method investments in real estate joint ventures impairments on proprietary real estate investments and lower base management fees.     Other-than-temporary impairments declined significantly in the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to a change in the recognition of impairment losses resulting from the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2. See — Investments — Portfolio Review — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.    154    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Restructuring-related expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 for the Asset Management segment were $10 million and $25 million, respectively.     Quarterly Spread-Based Investment Business Results     The Spread-Based Investment business reported operating income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss in the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments, net fair value gains on short credit default swap positions due to narrowing credit spreads, net realized gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and lower funding costs in the GIC business. These improvements were partially offset by net unrealized losses due to foreign exchange movements on foreign currency denominated GIC liabilities and a decline in income from partnership investments held in the GIC portfolio.     AIG enters into derivative arrangements to hedge the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs. Some of these hedging relationships do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore create volatility in operating results despite being effective economic hedges.     Year-to-Date Spread-Based Investment Business Results     The Spread-Based Investment business reported operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to an operating loss in the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments, net realized gains on short credit default swap positions due to narrowing credit spreads, net fair value gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and lower losses driven by foreign exchange movements on foreign currency denominated GIC liabilities. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in income from partnership investments held in the GIC portfolio.     The GIC program is in runoff with no new GICs issued subsequent to 2005. The anticipated runoff of the domestic GIC portfolio was as follows:                                                                              Remainder                       At June 30, 2009      of 2009     2010-2012     2013-2014     Thereafter     Total         (In billions)          Domestic GICs      $   2.1       $   2.7       $   2.5       $   3.6       $   10.9           Contractual maturities of debt issued under the MIP was as follows:                                                                              Remainder                       At June 30, 2009      of 2009     2010-2012     2013-2014     Thereafter     Total         (In billions)          MIP liabilities      $   —       $   7.5       $   1.2       $   4.4       $   13.1           The GIC and MIP both invest in various fixed income asset classes which include corporate debt, both public and private, and structured fixed income products consisting of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and CDOs. The majority of these investments are currently rated investment grade. In addition, the GIC and the MIP invests in bank loans, commercial mortgage loans and single name credit default swaps. The GIC invests in limited partnership (or equivalent) interests in private equity and hedge funds, however the MIP does not.     Quarterly Institutional Asset Management Results     Institutional Asset Management recognized an operating loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to operating income in the same period in 2008, primarily resulting from losses on equity method investments in real estate joint ventures, impairments of proprietary real estate investments, lower base management fees and net realized capital losses primarily related to credit default swaps. The operating loss was partially offset by a $72 million gain on the sale of AIG Private Bank.    155    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Real estate impairments continue within the direct investment portfolio as well as through real estate joint ventures as the global credit crisis has continued to put pressure on real estate values, occupancy rates and leasing. This downward pressure has caused impairments across the portfolio.     Base management fees have declined from prior year periods due to lower average assets under management. The lower average asset base is a function of reduced asset values and client loss, which primarily occurred in the second half of 2008 and has since abated.     Year-to-Date Institutional Asset Management Results     Institutional Asset Management recognized an increased operating loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily resulting from losses on equity method investments in real estate joint ventures, impairments of proprietary real estate investments, lower base management fees and lower carried interest revenues. The operating loss was partially offset by a $72 million gain on the sale of AIG Private Bank. The drivers for the increase in real estate impairments and reduced management fees are similar to the results drivers for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2009, unrealized carried interest revenues have declined as compared to the prior year period due to a decline in portfolio asset valuations. Unrealized carried interest revenues are impacted by asset valuation changes within the managed portfolio and typically move in tandem with the level of assets under management and related base management fees.     Real estate impairments continue within the direct investment portfolio as well as through real estate joint ventures as the global credit crisis has continued to put pressure on real estate values, occupancy rates and leasing. This downward pressure has caused impairments across the portfolio.     AIG’s unaffiliated client assets under management, including retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, were $64.0 billion, $68.9 billion and $92.8 billion at June 30, 2009, December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008, respectively. The decline from December 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008 reflects lower asset values due to the significant deterioration in the credit and equity markets during 2008 as well as the effect of net client outflows.     Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds     Revenues and operating income related to Brokerage Services and Mutual Fund activities decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 from the same periods in 2008 due to lower fee income as a result of a lower asset base and a decline in commission income resulting from difficult market conditions.     Other Asset Management Results     Revenues and operating income related to Other Asset Management activities increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 from the same period in 2008, due to higher partnership income. Revenues and operating income related to Other Asset Management activities decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 from the same period in 2008, due to lower partnership income driven by weaker market conditions.      Other Operations      AIG’s Other operations include interest expense, restructuring costs, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments, expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls, corporate initiatives and certain compensation plan expenses.     Additionally, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, in order to better align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG’s chief operating decision makers manage their businesses, the results for Mortgage Guaranty, Transatlantic, Personal Lines (excluding Private Client Group) and HSB are now included in AIG’s Other operations. These amounts were previously reported as part of General Insurance operations. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation.    156    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Other Results     The operating income of AIG’s Other category was as follows:                                                                                          Three Months Ended        Percentage        Six Months Ended        Percentage            June 30,       Increase/        June 30,       Increase/            2009       2008       (Decrease)       2009       2008       (Decrease)           (In millions)            Parent company:                                                       Income from equity method investments, net of dividends or distributions      $   (5   )     $   8         —   %     $   (32   )     $   16         —   %      Interest income        748         68         —         1,724         90         —        Interest expense on Federal Reserve Bank of New York credit facility        (1,374   )       —         —         (2,904   )       —         —        Other interest expense        (547   )       (452   )       —         (1,093   )       (820   )       —        Unallocated corporate expenses        (356   )       (350   )       —         (419   )       (465   )       —        Restructuring expenses        (130   )       —         —         (248   )       —         —        Change in fair value of ML III        539         —         —         (1,401   )       —         —        Net realized capital gains (losses)        (387   )       30         —         596         (235   )       —        Other miscellaneous, net        86         (19   )       —         254         (69   )       —                                                            Total Parent company        (1,426   )       (715   )       —   %       (3,523   )       (1,483   )       —   %                                                          Noncore businesses:                                                       Mortgage Guaranty        (488   )       (518   )       —   %       (968   )       (872   )       —   %      Change in fair value of ML III        462         —         —         462         —         —        Other        115         133         (14   )       220         309         (29   )                                                          Total noncore businesses        89         (385   )       —   %       (286   )       (563   )       —   %                                                          Total Other operations      $   (1,337   )     $   (1,100   )       —   %     $   (3,809   )     $   (2,046   )       —   %                                                             Parent Company     Parent company operating loss in the three months ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to interest expense on the FRBNY Facility, net realized capital losses primarily arising from asset dispositions, and restructuring expenses. These were partially offset by interest income on intercompany loans, which are eliminated in consolidation, and a gain associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML III. Parent company contributed its equity interest in ML III to an AIG subsidiary, reported above in Noncore businesses, during the second quarter of 2009.     Parent company operating loss in the six months ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to interest expense on the FRBNY Facility, losses associated with the change in fair value of AIG’s equity interest in ML III, and restructuring expenses. These were partially offset by interest income on intercompany loans and realized capital gains primarily arising from foreign currency gains in the first quarter of 2009 from hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting. Also included in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 was an addition of $225 million to litigation reserves.     Noncore businesses     Mortgage Guaranty     The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, that covers the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to four-family residences.     Mortgage Guaranty’s operating loss decreased for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to lower loss and loss adjustment expenses in domestic first- and second-liens offset by    157    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     higher losses and loss adjustment expenses in international. The domestic first-lien operating loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 decreased $12 million from the same period in 2008 to $239 million while the second-lien three month June 30, 2009 operating loss of $166 million decreased $105 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decline in first-lien operating loss reflects the recognition of a $148 million benefit due to stop loss limits on certain first-lien pool business. These results were partially offset by the increased operating loss in international for the three-month period ended June 30, 2009 of $69 million which is $65 million higher than the same period in 2008.     During 2008, UGC tightened underwriting guidelines and increased premium rates for its first-lien business, ceased insuring second-lien business as of September 30, 2008 and during the fourth quarter of 2008 ceased insuring new private student loan business and suspended insuring new business throughout its European operations. All of these actions were in response to the worsening conditions in the global housing markets and resulted in a significant decline in new business written during the second half of 2008 and the first six months of 2009.     UGC’s domestic mortgage risk in force totaled $29.4 billion as of June 30, 2009 and the 60+-day delinquency ratio was 9.9 percent (based on number of policies, consistent with mortgage industry practice) compared to domestic mortgage risk in force of $31.8 billion and a delinquency ratio of 4.9 percent at June 30, 2008. Approximately 85 percent of the domestic mortgage risk is secured by first-lien, owner-occupied properties.     The second-lien risk in force at June 30, 2009 totaled $2.7 billion compared to $3.5 billion of risk in force at June 30, 2008. Risk in force represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions. Mortgage Guaranty’s loss projections include expected losses of $230 million related to reinstatement layers with approximately $1 billion of risk in force exposure for pools that have already or are expected to reach the stop loss.     Mortgage Guaranty’s operating loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008. The increased operating loss reflects increased loss and loss adjustment expenses of $285 million offset by a release of $222 million of premium deficiency reserve in the first quarter of 2009. Domestic first-lien and international business operating losses of $643 million and $94 million respectively for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 were $227 million and $83 million higher respectively during the same period in 2008. Domestic second-lien business reported an operating loss of $203 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 which was $259 million lower than the same period in 2008 reflecting the release of the premium deficiency reserve in the first quarter of 2009.     Other noncore businesses consist of the following:     Transatlantic     Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis both in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk.     On June 10, 2009, AIG closed the previously announced public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock owned directly and indirectly by AIG for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. At the close of the public offering, AIG indirectly retained 13.9 percent of the Transatlantic common stock issued and outstanding. As a result, AIG deconsolidated Transatlantic, which resulted in a $1.4 billion reduction in Noncontrolling interest, a component of Total equity. Operating income for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 include a loss of $217 million related to the deconsolidation of Transatlantic.     21st Century     On July 1, 2009, AIG closed the sale of 21st Century Insurance Group and the Agency Auto Division (excluding AIG Private Client Group). Operating income for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 include a loss of $471 million related to the sale of 21st Century.    158    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       HSB     On March 31, 2009, AIG closed the sale of HSB, the parent company of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, to Munich Re Group. Operating income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 includes a gain of $251 million related to the sale of HSB.      Critical Accounting Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers that its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of              •   AIG’s ability to continue as a going concern,         •   liability for general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses,         •   future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts,         •   recoverability of DAC, estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products,         •   the allowance for finance receivable losses,         •   flight equipment recoverability,         •   other-than-temporary impairments,         •   goodwill impairment,         •   estimates with respect to income taxes, and         •   fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps and AIG’s economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III (Maiden Lane Interests).       These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s results of operations would be directly affected.     The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below.     AIG’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern     When assessing AIG’s ability to continue as a going concern, management must make judgments and estimates about the following:              •   the marketability of assets to be disposed of and the timing and amount of related cash proceeds to be used to repay indebtedness;         •   the planned sales of significant subsidiaries;         •   plans to raise new funds or restructure debt;         •   projections of future profitability and the timing and amount of cash flows from operating activities;         •   the funding needs of regulated subsidiaries;         •   AIG’s ability to comply with debt covenants;         •   plans to reduce expenditures;         •   the effects of ratings agency actions on collateral requirements and other contractual conditions; and         •   the future regulatory, business, credit, and competitive environments in which AIG operates around the world.      159    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       These factors, individually and collectively, will have a significant effect on AIG’s ability to generate sufficient cash to repay indebtedness as it becomes due and profitably operate its businesses as it executes its restructuring initiatives.              •   Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses (General Insurance):                •   Loss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years.         •   Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2009 for the year-end 2009 loss reserve analysis. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years.         •   Loss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount.         •   Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses: the expected recoveries from reinsurers on losses that have not yet been reported and/or settled.       For discussion of sensitivity analysis on the reserve for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, see Results of Operations — Segment Results — General Insurance Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense.              •   Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):                •   Interest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products.         •   Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form, risk classification and distribution channel.       Periodically, the net benefit reserves (policy benefit reserves less DAC) established for Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies are tested to ensure that, including consideration of future expected premium payments, they are adequate to provide for future policyholder benefit obligations. The assumptions used to perform the tests are current best-estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality, morbidity, terminations, company maintenance expenses and invested asset returns. For long duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies, whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience. These assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. For business in force outside of North America, 52 percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at June 30, 2009 resulted from traditional business where the lock-in principle applies. In most foreign locations, various guarantees are embedded in policies in force that may remain applicable for many decades into the future.     As experience changes over time, the best-estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes. Because of the long-term nature of many of AIG’s liabilities subject to the lock-in principle, small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy.              •   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):                •   Recoverability: based on current and future expected profitability, which is affected by interest rates, foreign exchange rates, mortality/morbidity experience, expenses, investment returns and policy persistency.                •   Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General Insurance):                •   Recoverability: based upon the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.                •   Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):                •   Estimated gross profits: to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (investment-oriented products), which affect the carrying value of DAC, unearned revenue liability, SIAs and associated      160    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                amortization patterns. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality and other expenses.                •   Allowance for Finance Receivable Losses (Financial Services):                •   Historical defaults and delinquency experience: utilizing factors, such as delinquency ratio, allowance ratio, charge-off ratio and charge-off coverage.         •   Portfolio characteristics: portfolio composition and consideration of the recent changes to underwriting criteria and portfolio seasoning.         •   External factors: consideration of current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.         •   Migration analysis: empirical technique measuring historical movement of similar finance receivables through various levels of repayment, delinquency, and loss categories to existing finance receivable pools.                •   Flight Equipment Recoverability (Financial Services):                •   Expected undiscounted future net cash flows: based upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and estimated terminal values of each aircraft based on expectations of market participants.                •   Other-Than-Temporary Impairments:       At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses. Prior to April 1, 2009, these reviews were conducted pursuant to FSP FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” See AIG’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 for a discussion of AIG’s process for evaluating other-than-temporary impairments prior to the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2.     In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments,” (FSP FAS 115-2), which amends the other-than-temporary impairment model for fixed maturity securities and requires additional disclosures. The impairment model for equity securities was not affected. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the FSP FAS 115-2.     In connection with AIG’s adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 on April 1, 2009, AIG changed its process for determining other-than-temporary impairments with respect to available for sale fixed maturity securities. If AIG intends to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings.     For all other fixed maturity securities for which a credit impairment has occurred, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to earnings. Additional fair value decline below recovery value, if any, is charged to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity investments on which other-than-temporary credit impairments were taken (a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) because this is considered a non-credit impairment.     When assessing AIG’s intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or if it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition AIG’s investment portfolio, sale of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing.     See the discussion in Note 5 for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by security type, which AIG uses to determine the amount of a credit loss.    161    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       AIG continues to evaluate its available for sale equity securities, equity method and cost method investments for impairment such that a security is considered a candidate for other-than-temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:              •   Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to cost for an extended period of time (nine consecutive months or longer);         •   The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or         •   AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.       The determination that an equity security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. The above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline, such as that experienced in current credit markets, in which AIG could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary (severity losses).     For further discussion, see Note 5 Investments — Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.     In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into income the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security.              •   Goodwill Impairment:       Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. AIG performed goodwill impairment testing at June 30, 2009.     The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.     Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG’s reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earning multiples of the unit’s peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test. As part of the impairment test, management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all AIG’s reporting units with AIG’s fully diluted common stock market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values.     If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill. The estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in income to the extent of the excess.     Management observed a narrowing of the fair values over the carrying values of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Japan and Other and the Life Insurance & Retirement Services — Asia reporting units    162    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     during the first six months of 2009. AIG will continue to monitor overall competitive, business and economic conditions, and other events or circumstances that might result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.              •   Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets:       At June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, AIG recorded a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of $12.8 billion and $11 billion, respectively. FAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” permits this asset to be recorded if the asset meets a more likely than not standard (i.e., more than 50 percent likely) that the asset will be realized. Realization of AIG’s net deferred tax asset depends on AIG’s ability to consummate the proposed AIA and ALICO purchase agreements and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred. Estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term, perhaps materially, which may require AIG to adjust its valuation allowance. Such adjustment, either positive or negative, could be material to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or its results of operations. Because the realization of the deferred tax asset relies on the completion of the proposed transactions and a projection of future taxable income, AIG views this as a critical accounting estimate.     AIG is relying upon producing taxable operating profits from the businesses to be retained, principally Commercial Insurance and Foreign General Insurance. AIG has evaluated its forecasts of future operating income and determined that there will be sufficient operating income, inclusive of gains on the divestiture of businesses to realize the recorded net deferred tax asset.     When making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at June 30, 2009, AIG considered all available evidence, including (i) the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, (ii) actions completed through July 31, 2009 and additional actions expected to be completed during the remainder of 2009, (iii) the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, (iv) the sources and timing of future taxable income, giving greater weight to discrete sources and to earlier future years in the forecast period, and (v) tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to accelerate taxable amounts.     In assessing future GAAP taxable income, AIG considered its strong earnings history exclusive of the recent losses on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and from the securities lending program. AIG also considered the completed transactions with the FRBNY and the Department of the Treasury, including (i) the execution of the ALICO and AIA purchase agreements, (ii) reduction of the interest rate payable on outstanding borrowing and undrawn amounts under the FRBNY Facility; (iii) the transfer of RMBS related to AIG’s U.S. securities lending program to ML II; (iv) the termination of substantially all multi-sector credit default swap transactions and sale of underlying CDO securities to ML III; (v) the issuance of the AIG Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for the AIG Series D Preferred Stock; and (vi) the issuance of the AIG Series F Preferred Stock and the establishment of the Department of the Treasury Commitment.     AIG’s profitability in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic conditions, catastrophes and other events around the world and, currently, AIG-specific events. Further, the results of operations in the first six months of 2009 may not be indicative of the results expected for the full year because certain transactions proposed to be entered into with the Department of the Treasury and the FRBNY are not expected to be in place. However, AIG believes its forecasts are achievable.     There are many important factors that could significantly affect the attainment of AIG’s forecasted results. For a discussion of some of these factors, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in AIG’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2008 Form 10-K.              •   U.S. Income Taxes on Earnings of Certain Foreign Subsidiaries:       Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes incurred on potential dispositions, as well as AIG’s reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.    163    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries                •   Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview     AIG measures at fair value on a recurring basis financial instruments in its trading and available for sale securities portfolios, certain mortgage and other loans receivable, certain spot commodities, derivative assets and liabilities, securities purchased/sold under agreements to resell/repurchase, securities lending invested collateral, non-traded equity investments and certain private limited partnerships and certain hedge funds included in other invested assets, certain short-term investments, separate and variable account assets, certain policyholder contract deposits, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors, certain CPFF and other commercial paper, certain long-term debt, and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing, able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date.     The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other-than-active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. An other-than-active market is one in which there are few transactions, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions.     AIG management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. With respect to securities, AIG employs independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments. When AIG’s valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models.     Valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, currency rates, and other market-observable information, as applicable. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.     AIG employs specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of AIG’s financial assets and financial liabilities. AIG’s processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate, consistently applied, and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. AIG assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques. In addition, AIG may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from AIG’s valuation service providers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. AIG also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of    164    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.     The fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination was as follows:                                          Fair        Percent         At June 30, 2009      Value       of Total           (In billions)            Fair value based on external sources(a)      $   383         94   %      Fair value based on internal sources        26         6                            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)      $   409         100   %                                       (a)    Includes $28.2 billion whose primary source is broker quotes.      (b)    Includes available for sale, trading and securities lending invested collateral securities.      See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG’s accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of the following financial assets and financial liabilities:              •   Fixed maturity securities — trading and available for sale;         •   Equity securities traded in active markets — trading and available for sale;         •   Non-traded equity investments — other invested assets;         •   Private limited partnership and hedge fund investments — other invested assets;         •   Separate account assets;         •   Freestanding derivatives;         •   Embedded policy derivatives;         •   AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio; and         •   Policyholder contract deposits.       Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     Under FAS 157, assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about fair value measurements.     At June 30, 2009, AIG classified $36.0 billion and $19.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.3 percent and 2.5 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2009. At December 31, 2008, AIG classified $42.1 billion and $21.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 4.9 percent and 2.6 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.     In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.    165    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Valuation of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     AIG values its assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable. The following paragraphs describe the methods AIG uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in Level 3.     Private equity and real estate fund investments: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price, i.e., the price paid to acquire the asset. Subsequently, they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments, the accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis. AIG considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement.     Corporate bonds and private placement debt: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued using market data for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads), comparisons to benchmark derivative indices or movements in underlying credit spreads. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name credit default swap spreads and estimated recovery rates.     Certain RMBS and CMBS: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles, remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations, discounted cash flow techniques, and/or for RMBS option adjusted spread analyses.     Certain Asset-Backed Securities — non-mortgage: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they may be valued based on external price/spread data. When position-specific external price data are not observable, the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities.     CDOs: These assets initially are valued at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are valued based on external price/spread data from independent third parties, dealer quotations, matrix pricing, the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model or a combination thereof.     Interests in ML II and ML III: At their inception, AIG’s Maiden Lane Interests were valued at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively. Subsequently, Maiden Lane Interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the Maiden Lane Interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool. The implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with AIG’s interests in the capital structure of the respective entities. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.     The fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in ML II and ML III will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of ML II and ML III. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.     See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests.    166    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Increases in the discount rate or decreases in estimated future cash flows used in the valuation would decrease AIG’s estimate of the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests as shown in the table below.

In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.

Through July 31, 2009, AIGFP had also received a formal termination notice with respect to an additional $2.8 billion in net notional amount with an effective termination date in 2009. AIG expects that the counterparties in the remaining regulatory capital CDS transactions will terminate within the next 9 months the vast majority of transactions with AIGFP during the transition period of the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties.     During the first six months of 2009, AIGFP reclassified one regulatory capital CDS transaction from Regulatory Capital — Corporate loans to Regulatory Capital — Other given the higher likelihood that it will not be terminated when the regulatory capital benefit expires for the counterparty. AIG does not believe that at this time the CDS provides significant risk transfer benefit to the counterparty; however, AIGFP will continue to monitor this transaction closely.     During April 2009, AIGFP effected the early termination of a CDS transaction written on a European RMBS security of $1.5 billion in net notional amount that was reported as part of Regulatory Capital — Other at March 31, 2009 at a level approximating its fair value at that time. Given its unique structure and concentrated exposure to high loan-to-value Spanish residential mortgages, this transaction had exposed AIGFP to a relatively higher level of liquidity and credit risk than any other regulatory capital CDS exposure, and AIG felt it prudent to terminate the transaction to avoid further deterioration.     In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2009 other than for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties’ early termination rights, and AIGFP’s expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.    169    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents, for each of the regulatory capital CDS transactions in the corporate loan portfolio, the gross transaction notional amount at June 30, 2009, net notional amount at June 30, 2009, attachment point at inception and at June 30, 2009, inception to date realized losses through June 30, 2009 and percent non-investment grade at June 30, 2009:                                                                                          Gross Transaction        Net Notional                    Realized Losses        Percent            Notional Amount at        Amount at        Attachment Point        Attachment Point        through        Non-investment Grade         CDS      June 30, 2009       June 30, 2009       at Inception(a)       at June 30, 2009(a)       June 30, 2009(b)       at June 30, 2009(c)           (Dollars in millions)            1(d)      $   3,332       $   2,788         11.00   %       16.00   %       0.15   %       95.70   %      2        3,509         2,948         16.00   %       16.00   %       0.00   %       42.42   %      3        891         791         10.03   %       11.23   %       0.52   %       16.58   %      4        14,037         7,861         44.00   %       44.00   %       0.00   %       0.68   %      5        2,523         2,273         10.00   %       9.86   %       0.15   %       13.88   %      6        9,585         8,143         12.02   %       15.04   %       0.00   %       14.98   %      7        8,423         7,481         11.00   %       11.18   %       0.00   %       8.59   %      8        598         345         18.00   %       42.28   %       0.00   %       62.59   %      9        10,865         9,652         10.80   %       11.17   %       0.00   %       6.04   %      10        11,767         10,312         11.30   %       12.36   %       0.16   %       21.87   %      11        5,396         4,783         11.00   %       11.36   %       0.09   %       10.65   %      12        4,998         4,320         13.26   %       13.55   %       0.00   %       71.62   %      13        9,826         3,011         12.00   %       12.00   %       0.00   %       4.15   %      14        2,425         2,028         15.85   %       16.35   %       0.00   %       7.75   %      15        4,075         3,288         14.50   %       19.31   %       0.00   %       74.48   %      16        2,015         1,532         12.30   %       23.96   %       0.00   %       28.98   %      17        1,063         712         23.44   %       33.03   %       0.00   %       28.98   %      18        2,323         1,937         11.73   %       16.62   %       0.00   %       28.98   %      19        2,000         1,820         9.00   %       9.00   %       0.00   %       6.25   %      20        9,662         7,276         17.00   %       24.69   %       0.00   %       13.04   %                                                          Total      $   109,313       $   83,301                                                                                                         (a)    Expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount of the referenced obligations.

(b)    Represents realized losses incurred by the transaction (defaulted amounts less amounts recovered) from inception through June 30, 2009 expressed as a percentage of the initial gross transaction notional amount.      (c)    Delinquency information is not provided to AIGFP for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of these transactions. However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to AIGFP for such referenced pools.      All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.     As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage    171    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP’s public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.     For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In virtually all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty’s assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans. Additionally, for a significant majority of these regulatory capital CDS transactions, upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool, AIG receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower, notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event.     Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The “Percent Non-Investment Grade” information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. For example, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP’s assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values, and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. The four pools containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 45.00 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The average number of loans in each pool is over 7,000. This large number of smaller balance loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. Each transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at June 30, 2009. Only one other pool has non-investment grade percentage greater than 30.00 percent, but this transaction has 2.50 years remaining, benefits from a reserve account which absorbs losses prior to any tranche being impacted, has no realized losses from inception through June 30, 2009 (after the application of the reserve account) and has a tranche junior to it which was rated AAA by two rating agencies at June 30, 2009. Approximately 0.25 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 0.00 percent to 1.03 percent.     For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.     Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on approximately 75.14 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.13 percent to 4.29 percent, averaging 0.79 percent. For all but three transactions, which    172    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     comprised less than 1.20 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.27 percent and ranged from 0.01 percent to 2.16 percent. The default rate on the remaining three transactions ranged from 4.11 percent to 11.95 percent. The subordination on these three transactions ranged from 30.52 percent to 39.04 percent.     Where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIG monitors the rating agencies’ releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.     AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses, and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers, and information available from rating agencies, governments, and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans with similar characteristics that comprise the collateral pools.     Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP’s own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.

In certain cases, simultaneously with the exercise of the 2a-7 Puts by AIGFP’s counterparties, AIGFP accessed financing arrangements previously entered into with such counterparties, pursuant to which the counterparties remained the legal owners of the underlying CDO securities. However, these securities were reported as part of AIGFP’s investment portfolio as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Most of these underlying CDO securities were later acquired by ML III from AIGFP’s counterparties. In a separate case, AIGFP extinguished its obligations with respect to one CDS by purchasing the protected CDO security.      (b)    The CDS in respect of the ML III transaction were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 based on the fair value of the underlying multi-sector CDOs at October 31, 2008, as mutually agreed between the FRBNY and AIG. AIGFP recognized the change in fair value of the CDS through that date.     175    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the AIGFP super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swaps were as follows:                                                                                          Three Months        Six Months        Year Ended            Ended June 30,       Ended June 30,       December 31,           2009       2008       2009       2008       2008       2007           (In millions)            CDS — terminated in connection with ML III      $   —       $   (4,324   )     $   —       $   (11,078   )     $   (20,365   )     $   (9,680   )      CDS — underlying CDO purchased by AIGFP        —         (587   )       —         (898   )       (854   )       (141   )      CDS — all other        (284   )       (658   )       (1,093   )       (1,630   )       (4,481   )       (1,425   )                                                          Total      $   (284   )     $   (5,569   )     $   (1,093   )     $   (13,606   )     $   (25,700   )     $   (11,246   )                                                             The following table presents, for each multi-sector CDO that is a reference obligation in a CDS written by AIGFP, the gross and net notional amounts at June 30, 2009, attachment points at inception and at June 30, 2009 and percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B-3 at June 30, 2009:                                                                                                      Percentage of Gross            Gross Notional        Net Notional                    Notional Amount Rated            Amount at        Amount at              Attachment Point        Less than B-/B-3 at            June 30,        June 30,        Attachment Point        at June 30,        June 30,         CDO      2009       2009       at Inception*       2009*       2009            1      $   1,216       $   479         40.00   %       60.64   %       52.94   %      2        697         326         53.00   %       53.20   %       22.78   %      3        1,000         470         53.00   %       53.00   %       57.38   %      4        1,384         321         76.00   %       76.79   %       69.27   %      5        1,012         4         10.83   %       11.44   %       21.58   %      6        329         205         39.33   %       37.84   %       89.08   %      7        1,201         1,079         12.27   %       10.16   %       12.91   %      8        1,266         890         25.24   %       24.62   %       10.43   %      9        1,454         1,350         10.00   %       7.14   %       26.24   %      10        532         314         33.00   %       41.04   %       71.36   %      11        506         247         33.25   %       26.41   %       74.21   %      12        2,519         1,735         16.50   %       18.31   %       0.00   %      13        425         224         32.00   %       47.35   %       62.87   %      14        622         468         24.49   %       24.72   %       74.17   %      15        676         421         32.90   %       37.71   %       93.26   %      16        333         200         34.51   %       40.00   %       93.49   %      17        4,641         418         9.72   %       11.43   %       35.89   %                                                  Total      $   19,813       $   9,151                                                                                         *    Expressed as a percentage of gross notional amount.      In a number of instances, the level of subordination with respect to individual CDOs has increased since inception relative to the overall size of the CDO. While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.    176    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The gross transaction notional amount, percentage of the total CDO collateral pools, and ratings and vintage breakdown of collateral securities in the multi-sector CDOs, by asset-backed securities (ABS) category, were as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                          Gross                                                                                      At June 30, 2009     Transaction                                                                                      ABS      Notional        Percent        Ratings       Vintage        Category      Amount       of Total       AAA       AA       A       BBB       BB       <BB       NR       2009       2008       2007       2006       2005+P           (In millions)                                                                                                                                RMBS PRIME      $   2,742         13.84   %       1.95   %       1.93   %       1.47   %       2.52   %       3.80   %       2.17   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       8.52   %       3.93   %       1.39   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              RMBS ALT-A        3,355         16.93   %       1.38   %       0.20   %       0.29   %       1.63   %       0.74   %       12.69   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.75   %       4.51   %       6.05   %       5.62   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              RMBS SUBPRIME        4,673         23.59   %       0.75   %       1.49   %       1.29   %       1.12   %       1.24   %       17.70   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       1.43   %       2.15   %       20.01   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              CMBS        3,330         16.81   %       3.22   %       1.09   %       1.86   %       4.37   %       2.10   %       4.08   %       0.09   %       0.00   %       0.09   %       1.53   %       7.21   %       7.98   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              CDO        2,077         10.48   %       0.66   %       0.95   %       0.86   %       0.97   %       0.64   %       6.34   %       0.06   %       0.00   %       0.00   %       0.77   %       2.02   %       7.69   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              OTHER        3,636         18.35   %       5.06   %       5.04   %       5.19   %       2.12   %       0.59   %       0.33   %       0.02   %       0.00   %       0.50   %       0.90   %       4.84   %       12.11   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Total      $   19,813         100.00   %       13.02   %       10.70   %       10.96   %       12.73   %       9.11   %       43.31   %       0.17   %       0.00   %       1.34   %       17.66   %       26.20   %       54.80   %                                                                                                                             Corporate Debt/CLOs     The corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of CDS written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the CDS.

Collateral     Most of AIGFP’s credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.    178    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions     As of June 30, 2009, 76.1 percent of AIGFP’s regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to a Credit Support Annex (CSA) and 23.9 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone Master Agreement or similar agreement, under which the aggregate Exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.     The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies from one counterparty to another, and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from varied negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.     Reference to Market Indices — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans, or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.     Market Value of Reference Obligation — Under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the difference between the net notional amount of a referenced RMBS security and the security’s market value.     Expected Loss Models — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses, generally determined using a rating-agency model.     Negotiated Amount — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.     The amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than AIGFP’s super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended were as follows (there were no collateral postings on this portfolio prior to March 31, 2008):                                                                                                      March 31,        June 30,        September 30,        December 31,        March 31,        June 30,        July 31,            2008       2008       2008       2008       2009       2009       2009           (In millions)            Reference to market indices      $   212       $   177       $   157       $   667       $   598       $   293       $   221        Market value of referenced obligation        —         142         286         380         317         —         —        Expected loss models        —         —         —         5         24         26         27        Negotiated amount        —         —         —         235         225         220         224                                                                    Total      $   212       $   319       $   443       $   1,287       $   1,164       $   539       $   472                                                                       Collateral Calls     AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.    179    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The amount of collateral postings with respect to AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended were as follows:                                                                                                      March 31,        June 30,        September 30,        December 31,        March 31,        June 30,        July 31,            2008       2008       2008       2008       2009       2009       2009           (In millions)            Regulatory capital      $   212       $   319       $   443       $   1,287       $   1,164       $   539       $   472        Arbitrage — multi-sector CDO        7,590         13,241         31,469         5,129         6,208         4,586         4,328        Arbitrage — corporate        368         259         902         2,349         1,995         1,165         1,012                                                                    Total      $   8,170       $   13,819       $   32,814       $   8,765       $   9,367       $   6,290       $   5,812                                                                       The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG’s credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. Given the severe market disruption, lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption, AIGFP is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future.     Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio     Multi-Sector CDOs     AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG’s calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average for any quarterly period during the past year, prices for CDOs declined between 5.57 percent and 11.93 percent of the notional amount outstanding. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current dislocated market conditions.     For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $9.2 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at June 30, 2009, a BET value is available for $5.5 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $3.7 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $5.5 billion.     As mentioned above, the most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities given their significantly depressed valuations. Given the current difficult market conditions, AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.    180    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at June 30, 2009 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                  Average                                                        Inputs Used at          Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability           June 30,          Entire        RMBS        RMBS        RMBS                              2009     Change     Portfolio       PRIME       ALT-A       Subprime       CMBS       CDOs       Other                   (Dollars in millions)            Bond prices      33 points     Increase of 5 points     $   (581   )     $   (19   )     $   (52   )     $   (249   )     $   (128   )     $   (102   )     $   (31   )             Decrease of 5 points       495         19         49         214         126         56         31                                                                            Weighted average life      5.01 years     Increase of 1 year       171         5         9         163         (12   )       2         4               Decrease of 1 year       (347   )       (9   )       (7   )       (330   )       9         (6   )       (4   )                                                                          Recovery rates      21%     Increase of 10%       (75   )       (5   )       (7   )       (22   )       (36   )       (2   )       (3   )             Decrease of 10%       106         6         9         43         44         1         3                                                                            Diversity score(a)      16     Increase of 5       (8   )                                                             Decrease of 5       32                                                                                                                            Discount curve(b)      N/A     Increase of 100bps       42                                                                                                                                         (a)    The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

reclassification of noncore businesses from General Insurance to Other. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.      (b)    At June 30, 2009, approximately 58 percent and 42 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities, respectively, compared to approximately 54 percent and 46 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2008.       Investment Strategy      AIG’s investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Retirement Services and Asset Management.     Spread-Based Investment business. The primary objectives are liquidity, preservation of capital, growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products. Difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered AIG’s ability to achieve these objectives, and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future.     At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.     The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies, as well as in the GIC and MIP portfolios of the Asset Management segment, the fundamental investment strategy is to match, as nearly as is practicable, the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets. Fixed maturity securities   183    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     held by the insurance companies included in Commercial Insurance historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In light of AIG’s net operating losses in the third quarter of 2008, AIG changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax-exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries. Fixed maturity securities held by Foreign General Insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities.     The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk, and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.     AIG records at fair value the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies pursuant to FAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and related accounting pronouncements. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on AIG’s balance sheet pursuant to SOP 03-01), AIG does not adjust the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG’s liabilities. Because AIG’s asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the fair value of its fixed maturity portfolio.     At June 30, 2009, approximately 51 percent of the fixed maturity securities were in domestic entities. Approximately 25 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 10 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG’s investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspectives for consideration in the internal analysis.     A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody’s, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG’s Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2009, approximately 13 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG’s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated.

AIG’s strategy is typically to invest in securities rated AA or better at the time of the investment.    187    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Investments in CMBS     The amortized cost of AIG’s CMBS investments, other than those of AIGFP, was as follows:                                                                  June 30, 2009       December 31, 2008           Amortized        Percent        Amortized        Percent            Cost       of Total       Cost       of Total           (In millions)            CMBS (traditional)      $   17,293         91   %     $   13,033         92   %      ReRemic/CRE CDO        1,204         6         583         4        Agency        158         1         159         1        Other        347         2         430         3                                            Total      $   19,002         100   %     $   14,205         100   %                                             The percentage of AIG’s CMBS investments, other than those of AIGFP, by credit rating was as follows:                                          June 30,        December 31,            2009       2008            Rating:                       AAA        72   %       84   %      AA        13         8        A        9         6        BBB and below        6         2                            Total        100   %       100   %                             The percentage of AIG’s CMBS investments, other than those of AIGFP, by year of vintage was as follows:                                          June 30,        December 31,            2009       2008            Year:                       2008        1   %       1   %      2007        26         23        2006        15         11        2005        21         17        2004 and prior        37         48                            Total        100   %       100   %                            188    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The percentage of AIG’s CMBS investments, other than those of AIGFP, by geographic region was as follows:                                          June 30,        December 31,            2009       2008            Geographic region:                       New York        16   %       15   %      California        15         13        Texas        7         6        Florida        7         6        Illinois        4         3        Virginia        4         3        New Jersey        3         3        Pennsylvania        3         3        Maryland        3         2        Georgia        3         2        All Other        35         44                            Total        100   %       100   %                             The percentage of AIG’s CMBS investments, other than those of AIGFP, by industry was as follows:                                          June 30,        December 31,            2009       2008            Industry:                       Office        32   %       33   %      Retail        31         31        Multi-family        17         17        Lodging        7         7        Industrial        7         7        Other        6         5                            Total        100   %       100   %                             There have been disruptions in the commercial mortgage markets in general, and the CMBS market in particular, with credit default swaps indices and quoted prices of securities at levels consistent with a severe correction in lease rates, occupancy and fair value of properties.

mortgage and credit markets, AIG has recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge (severity loss) of $14 million and $4.8 billion in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.8 billion and $8.9 billion in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. With the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 on April 1, 2009, such charges in the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily related to equity securities of financial institutions. In all prior periods, such charges primarily related to mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateral securities, securities of financial institutions and other equity securities. Notwithstanding AIG’s intent and ability to hold such securities until they    194    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     had recovered their cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.     Pricing of CMBS had been adversely affected by concerns that underlying mortgage defaults will increase. As a result, AIG recognized $55 million of other-than-temporary impairment severity charges in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, all in the first quarter prior to the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2, on CMBS valued at a severe discount to cost, despite the absence of any meaningful deterioration in performance of the underlying credits, because AIG concluded that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment period was temporary.     In addition to the above severity losses, AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 related to:              •   securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;         •   declines due to foreign exchange rates;         •   issuer-specific credit events;         •   certain structured securities impaired under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,” and related interpretative guidance; and         •   other impairments, including equity securities and partnership investments.       AIG recognized $608 million and $1.7 billion in other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, due to issuer-specific credit events, and $172 million and $964 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009, respectively, due to changes in intent.     No other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.05 percent of Total equity in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009.     In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into income the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amount of accretion recognized in earnings for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was $465 million.

(d)    The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC.      (e)    Includes securities lending invested collateral.      The significant increase in the amounts shown as Cost in the table above from the previous quarter reflects the effects of the adoption of FSP FAS 115-2. Upon adoption, $16.1 billion of previously recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges on fixed maturity securities, primarily severity related, was added to the cost basis of the securities, with a corresponding increase in Unrealized Loss. Offsetting the increase in Unrealized Loss was $9.6 billion of unrealized appreciation on such securities during the second quarter of 2009.

Risk Management      For a complete discussion of AIG’s risk management program, see Risk Management in the 2008 Form 10-K.    196    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Overview      AIG continues to reassess its risk management control environment and its enterprise risk management functions, both in its individual businesses as well as at the corporate level, in light of AIG’s current situation. AIG continues to focus on enhancing its risk management processes and de-risking certain exposures, both at the corporate and business levels in an effort to minimize the capital and liquidity needs of AIG’s local legal entities. However, market turmoil and associated price declines, limited liquidity in the markets and a decline in the number of counterparties willing to transact with AIG continue to severely constrain AIG’s ability to utilize techniques for mitigating its exposure to credit, market and liquidity risks.      Credit Risk Management      AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives, deposits and letters of credit (both in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk.     The following table presents AIG’s largest credit exposures as a percentage of Total equity: At June 30, 2009                                        Credit Exposure        At June 30, 2009          as a Percentage of         Category      Risk Rating(a)     Total Equity            Investment Grade:                   10 largest combined      A−(b)       158.8   %(c)      Single largest non-sovereign (financial institution)      BBB−       16.2        Single largest corporate      AA       7.2        Single largest sovereign      AAA       31.4        Non-Investment Grade:                   Single largest sovereign      BB−       2.6        Single largest non-sovereign      BB       0.9                                     (a)    Reflects AIG’s internal risk ratings.      (b)    Four of the ten largest credit exposures are to financial institutions, four are to investment-grade rated sovereigns and two are to government-sponsored entities. None of the top ten is rated lower than BBB- or its equivalent.      (c)    Exposure to the ten largest combined as a percentage of Total equity was 150.7 percent at December 31, 2008.      AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG defines its cross-border exposure to include both cross-border credit exposures and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Nine countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 20 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2009. Based on AIG’s internal risk ratings, at that date, seven were rated AAA, one was rated AA and one was rated A.     In addition, AIG reviews and manages its industry concentrations. AIG’s single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector, comprised of banks, securities firms, life and non-life insurance companies, reinsurance companies, finance companies and government-sponsored entities.    197    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       The following table presents AIG’s largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of Total equity: At June 30, 2009                                          Credit Exposure                  as a Percentage of                  Total Equity                  Industry Category:                       Money Center / Global Bank Groups        138.2   %*              Government-Sponsored Entities        31.6                Global Life Insurance Companies        24.1                European Regional Financial Institutions        20.9                Global Reinsurance Companies        19.2                Asian Regional Financial Institutions        14.1                North American Based Regional Financial Institutions        13.4                Global Securities Companies        10.3                Non-Life Insurance Companies        8.5                             *    Exposure to Money Center/Global Bank Groups as a percentage of Total equity was 138.7 percent at December 31, 2008.      AIG’s exposure to its five largest money center/global bank group institutions was 55.8 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2009.     Credit exposure to Global Reinsurance Companies grew from 18.4 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2008 as the credit exposure to Transatlantic, previously a consolidated subsidiary, has been added to this category. Transatlantic is now AIG’s largest third-party reinsurer, representing approximately $1.5 billion of uncollateralized reinsurance assets. Transatlantic’s core operating subsidiaries have financial strength ratings of A+ by S&P and A by A.M. Best; the issuer credit rating is “a” by A.M. Best.     AIG’s exposure to global financial institutions includes $5.8 billion of preferred stock and Tier 1 securities, $1.1 billion of upper Tier 2 securities and $8.8 billion of lower Tier 2 securities. These securities can be subject to a higher risk of dividend or interest deferral and principal non-payment or non-redemption because they provide various levels of capital support to these institutions, and may be subject to regulatory and contractual restrictions. These securities are held by various AIG subsidiaries and are diversified by obligor and country. In addition, AIG’s financial institution exposures include other subordinated securities totaling $17.2 billion.     AIG also has a risk concentration through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG holds approximately $51.2 billion of tax-exempt and taxable securities issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories. A majority of these securities are held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG’s domestic property-casualty insurance companies. These securities are comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The average credit quality of these issuers is AA-.     Currently, several states, local governments and other issuers are facing pressures on their budget revenues from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG’s portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers is the State of California, of which AIG holds approximately $1.4 billion of general obligation bonds and which is also the largest single issuer in AIG’s portfolio. Nevertheless, despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does not expect any significant deterioration in the average credit quality of its portfolio holdings of municipal issuers.    198    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Insurance Risk Management      Catastrophe Exposures     The nature of AIG’s business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year. In order to control this exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting aggregate limits in key business units, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections.     Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIG’s operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, like the Swine Flu Influenza A Virus (H1N1), could adversely affect AIG’s business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs.     Pandemic Influenza     On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its alert level to 6 and declared that the new variant influenza A/H1N1 had reached pandemic alert status. Although AIG continues to monitor the developing facts, current evidence suggests that a resulting pandemic will be of moderate severity with some chance that it could be severe. To date, the virus has been mostly mild. The virus is occurring disproportionately in younger people and there is some evidence that individuals over 60 may have some resistance to the virus due to pre-existing immunity. Individuals infected generally recover fully after a few days and hospitalization rates have been low. However, it should be noted that as of July 7, three instances had been identified in which the H1N1 virus demonstrated a resistance to Tamiflu, the preferred treatment for the virus. The emergence of this resistant virus, or the emergence of a more virulent virus during the on-coming Northern Hemisphere flu season could result in a more severe pandemic.     A significant global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates.     Utilizing a scenario-based approach and an industry standard model, AIG has analyzed its insurance risk associated with pandemic influenza. For a severe event, considered to be a recurrence of the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the analysis indicates AIG could incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $6.3 billion if this event were to recur. For a mild event, considered to be a recurrence of the influenza epidemic of 1968, the analysis indicates AIG could incur a pre-tax loss of approximately $0.6 billion if such an event were to recur. These analyses were based on 2008 policy data representing approximately 95 percent of AIG’s individual life, group life and credit life books of business, net of reinsurance at that point in time. These estimates do not include claims that could be made under other policies, such as business interruption or general liability policies, and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of AIG’s own business operations or asset valuation losses that may arise consequent to such a pandemic. These related losses may be significant and in some scenarios exceed the losses incurred from AIG’s life insurance coverages.           ITEM 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Included in Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.           ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures       In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2009, AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.    199    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries        Part II — OTHER INFORMATION            ITEM 1.    Legal Proceedings       Included in Note 10(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     ITEM 1A. Risk Factors     The following supplements the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of the 2008 Form 10-K and in item 1A. Risk Factors of Part II of AIG’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 and summarizes information previously disclosed by AIG.     If the credit markets continue to deteriorate, AIG may recognize unrealized market valuation losses in AIGFP’s regulatory capital super senior credit default swap portfolio in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Moreover, the period of time that AIGFP remains at risk for such deterioration could be significantly longer than anticipated if AIGFP’s expectations with respect to the termination of transactions in its regulatory capital portfolio do not materialize.     A total of $177.5 billion (consisting of corporate loans and prime residential mortgages) in net notional amount of the super senior credit default swap CDS portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP), as of June 30, 2009, represented derivatives written for financial institutions, principally in Europe, for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief rather than for arbitrage purposes. The fair value of the derivative liability for these CDS transactions was $47 million at June 30, 2009.     The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP’s financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I) that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II). Financial institution counterparties are expected to transition from Basel I to Basel II over a two-year adoption period through December 31, 2009, after which they will receive little or no additional regulatory benefit from these CDS transactions, except in a small number of specific instances, and therefore AIGFP expects that the counterparties will terminate the vast majority of these transactions within the next 9 months. The pace at which these CDS transactions will be terminated following the transition to Basel II is affected by a number of factors, including the credit performance of the underlying assets.     The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP’s public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets required to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.     Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP’s own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory capital relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will terminate these transactions prior to their maturity. AIGFP will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace. Given the potential for further significant deterioration in the credit markets, there can be no assurance that AIG will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods. AIG could also    200    Table of Contents    American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     remain at risk for a significantly longer period of time than anticipated if AIGFP’s expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties do not materialize. Moreover, given the size of the credit exposure, a decline in the fair value of this portfolio could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition.
