Some of the measurements we use are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for "accounting principles generally accepted in the United States." The non-GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.    Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (AOCI) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented below in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A.  We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG and our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A.   •  AIG — After-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses, income from divested businesses, legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions (FIN 48) and other tax adjustments, legal reserves (settlements) related to "legacy crisis matters," deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges, changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, change in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital (gains) losses, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses, bargain purchase gain and net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests. "Legacy crisis matters" include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.  •  AIG Property Casualty    •  Operating income (loss): includes both underwriting income (loss) and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital (gains) losses, other (income) expense, legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above and bargain purchase gain. Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expense, acquisition expense and general operating expense.   •  Ratios: AIG Property Casualty, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.     •  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted: the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $10 million each.      71      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      •  Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted: the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.       •  AIG Life and Retirement    •  Operating income (loss): is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss): legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above, changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, net realized capital (gains) losses, and changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital (gains) losses. We believe that Operating income (loss) is useful because excluding these volatile items permits investors to better assess the operating performance of the underlying business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations.   •  Premiums and deposits: includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) and mutual funds.    •  Other Operations — Operating income (loss): income (loss) excluding certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters described above, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, Net realized capital (gains) losses, net (gains) losses on sale of divested businesses and properties, and income from divested businesses.  Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.    Executive Overview  This overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2012 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.   We report our results of operations as follows:  •  AIG Property Casualty — AIG Property Casualty offers property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. Commercial insurance products for large and small businesses are primarily distributed through insurance brokers. Major lines of business include casualty, property, financial and specialty (including aerospace, environmental, surety, marine, trade credit and political risk insurance). Consumer insurance products are distributed to individual consumers or groups of consumers through insurance brokers, agents, and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Consumer insurance products include accident & health (A&H) and personal insurance. In addition, Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) in Japan offers life insurance products through Fuji Life Insurance Company (Fuji Life), which are included in A&H.  •  AIG Life and Retirement — AIG Life and Retirement offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, A&H, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. AIG Life and Retirement offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms. During the first quarter of 2013, AIG Life and Retirement completed its previously announced reporting structure changes and now presents its results in the following two operating segments: Retail and Institutional. See Segment Results — AIG Life and Retirement Operations for additional information.   •  Other Operations — AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets (GCM) operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), Direct Investment book (including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP), Retained Interests and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).   72                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW     Executive Summary  We continued our positive financial and operational performance during the first quarter of 2013:  •  AIG Property Casualty reported improved operating income and has continued to experience positive pricing trends.  •  AIG Life and Retirement assets under management grew from deposits, net flows from individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds and appreciation due to higher equity markets. We continued to enhance spread income and actively manage the low interest rate environment.  •  Mortgage Guaranty reported new insurance written of $10.6 billion for the first quarter of 2013 compared to $6.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and has experienced improving credit trends.  •  Our investment portfolio performance, excluding gains recognized in the first quarter of 2012 from our previous investments in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) and AIA Group Limited (AIA), improved through yield enhancement initiatives, including the reduction of our concentration in lower-yielding tax-exempt municipal securities and the purchase of higher-yielding securities. The investment portfolio performance also improved due to an increase in partnership income primarily as a result of favorable equity market performance.  •  Realized capital gains improved because of lower other-than-temporary impairments and foreign exchange gains due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, euro and Japanese yen.   •  Our balance sheet is stronger as a result of our maturities, repayments and purchases of $2.9 billion of debt, including the redemption of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2047 and our purchase, in cash tender offers, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.0 billion, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion, of our junior subordinated debentures, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIG Life Holdings, Inc. (AIGLH) and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc. As a result of the redemption and cash tender offers, we expect annual interest expense to decrease by approximately $165 million.   •  We maintained financial flexibility through $1.3 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.

These changes did not affect Income from continuing operations before income tax expense or Net income attributable to AIG. Also, the presentation of the operating segments within the AIG Life and Retirement segment was revised in the current period to reflect two new operating segments: Retail and Institutional. For further discussion, see Notes 1 and 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     Investment Highlights  Net investment income decreased 41 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to fair value gains in the first quarter of 2012 on our investments in ML II, ML III and AIA, which were liquidated during 2012. The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was largely unchanged, and other-than- temporary impairments declined significantly compared to prior year levels, due in part to favorable developments in the housing sector which resulted in strong performance in our structured products portfolios.   •Our insurance operations achieved a $110 million increase in net investment income in spite of the challenges presented by a continuing low interest rate environment. Net investment income improved due to higher partnership income, driven primarily by equity market gains, which was partially offset by the absence of ML II gains in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to focus on risk-weighted opportunistic investments in residential mortgage-backed (RMBS) and other structured securities to improve yields.   75      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW   •Other-than-temporary Impairments were significantly lower than the prior year, in part driven by favorable developments in the housing sector which led to strong performance in our structured products portfolios.     Strategic Outlook     Industry Trends     Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, credit and equity market conditions, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2013, characterized by factors such as low interest rates, instability in the global markets due to the European debt crisis, uncertainly in the Far East and slow growth in the U.S. economy.  Low interest rates in the U.S. fixed income market have significantly affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines.     AIG Priorities for 2013   AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2013:  •Strengthen and improve the operating performance of our core businesses;   •Consummate the sale of up to 90 percent of our interest in ILFC;  •Enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality;   •Manage our capital and interest expense more efficiently by improving our capital structure and redeploying excess capital in areas that promote profitable growth;  •Work with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in its capacity as our principal regulator; and   •Reduce operating expenses by leveraging our scale and driving increased standardization through investments in infrastructure.      Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2013 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2012 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.     AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY OUTLOOK     We expect that the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets through at least the end of 2013. Due to these conditions, coupled with overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, we have sought to tighten terms and conditions, shed unprofitable business and develop advanced data analytics in order to improve profitability.  We have observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. Commencing in the second quarter of 2011, and continuing since, we have benefitted from favorable pricing trends, particularly in our U.S. commercial business. The property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in some markets. We expect that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions.   76      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      AIG Property Casualty Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities   •   Business Mix Shift   •Continue shifting toward higher value business to increase profitability.  •Expand in attractive growth economies, specifically in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America.    •   Underwriting Excellence – Enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate to the risk assumed.   •  Claims Best Practices – Implement improved claims practices and advanced technology to lower the loss ratio.   •   Operating Expense Discipline – Apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of our global footprint.   •  Capital Efficiency – Continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. •   Investment Strategy – Continue to execute our investment strategy, which includes increased asset diversification and yield-enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity, risk and return objectives.      Capital Efficiency     We continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for our operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing our global reinsurance strategy to improve capital efficiency.  We continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. In the first quarter of 2013, we completed six legal entity and branch restructuring transactions.  Effective March 29, 2013, we simplified the ownership structure of our surplus lines carriers in the U.S. to facilitate efficient capital allocation. Additionally, effective April 1, 2013, the Bermuda branch business of Chartis Excess Limited was transferred to American International Reinsurance Company (AIRCO) to simplify our business operations in Bermuda. AIRCO will be our primary insurance operation based in Bermuda. Our restructuring and capital management initiatives will enable AIRCO to make capital available to be used by AIG Property Casualty for general corporate purposes.  We made significant progress with respect to legal entity restructuring activities in the Asia Pacific region. On April 1, 2013, we completed the integration of most of our Japan operations under one licensed insurance holding company, AIG Japan Holdings KK, which holds the majority of our insurance companies and service companies that operate in Japan. The transaction is expected to enhance dividend capacity in the future.  We continue to implement restructuring plans in each region and the overall restructuring is expected to be mostly completed by the end of 2014, subject to regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions.     AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT OUTLOOK     AIG Life and Retirement's businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets. Continued low interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect sales of interest rate-sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing businesses. Products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate-adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields fall to a level that results in expected future losses. Also, low interest rates can affect the recoverability and accelerate the amortization of DAC assets held with respect to our variable annuity, fixed annuity and universal life businesses. Equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features, and can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC assets.   77      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  AIG Life and Retirement has implemented a number of actions to address the impact of low interest rates. These actions include a disciplined approach to pricing new business related to interest sensitive products (e.g. fixed annuities) and active management of renewal crediting rates. We have filed new life insurance and annuity products with reduced minimum rate guarantees.     AIG Life and Retirement Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities   •   Assets Under Management – Fully leverage our unified distribution organization to increase sales of profitable products across all channels. Capitalize on the growing demand for income solutions and on AIG Life and Retirement's capital base, risk controls, innovative product designs, expanded distribution initiatives and financial discipline to grow our variable annuity business. Pursue selected institutional market opportunities where AIG Life and Retirement's scale and capital base provide a competitive advantage.   •   Increase Life Insurance in Force – Develop innovative life offerings through consumer-focused research that delivers superior, differentiated product solutions. Consolidate life insurance platforms, operations and systems to create a more efficient, cost-competitive and agile operating model.  •  Enhance Return on Equity – We completed the merger of six life insurance operating legal entities into American General Life Insurance Company effective December 31, 2012. We expect to leverage our streamlined legal entity structure to enhance financial strength and durability, efficient capital allocation and the ease of doing business.  •  Investment Strategy – Consistent with AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy, AIG Life and Retirement places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies, structured securities collateralized by, among others, residential and commercial real estate, commercial mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, private equity, hedge funds, other alternative investments, and common and preferred stocks.  Our fundamental investment strategy is to maintain primarily a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to match the established duration targets based on the characteristics of its liabilities. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement enhances its returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships. Although these investments are subject to periodic volatility, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed income portfolio yields. AIG Life and Retirement's expectation is that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the fixed income portfolio yields over the long-term while providing important diversification to our investment portfolio. AIG Life and Retirement continues to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with attractive and appropriate risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.     78      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW     OTHER OPERATIONS OUTLOOK      Mortgage Guaranty        Mortgage Guaranty Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities   •   Underwriting Discipline – The mortgage market continues to show signs of improvement with increasing levels of originations, house value appreciation and tight mortgage underwriting standards. These trends, combined with the modest improvement of U.S. macroeconomic conditions, have had a favorable impact on our operating results, most notably on the quality of business written since 2009. Our risk-based pricing strategy has positioned UGC to take advantage of these improving market conditions and has resulted in the underwriting of a high quality book of business over the last four years. UGC plans to continue to execute this strategy during 2013 and to further enhance its risk-based pricing model. UGC will continue to review its new business pricing relative to changes in the market to ensure that the price of coverage is commensurate with the level of risk being underwritten.   •  Increase New Business Production through competitor differentiation. Beginning in 2009, UGC has differentiated itself from competitors through its risk-based pricing model that is designed to identify high quality new business and competitively price the associated risks.    Global Capital Markets (GCM)     AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The derivative portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives.  The remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the DIB and a portion of the legacy hedges for AIG and its subsidiaries. AIGFP's derivative portfolio consists primarily of interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity derivatives. Additionally, AIGFP has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with our risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.   Direct Investment Book (DIB)     The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all its liabilities, as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize return consistent with our risk management objectives. We are focused on meeting the DIB's liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB without relying on resources beyond the DIB. As part of this program management, we may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, we may seek to buy back debt or sell assets on an opportunistic basis, subject to market conditions.  From time to time, we may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB.  Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility. The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.   79                Table of Contents    ITEM 2. / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Results of Operations  The following section provides a comparative discussion of our Results of Operations for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.

For the first quarter of 2013, the effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was 24.5 percent. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and a decrease in the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains on sales of AIG Life and Retirement's available-for-sale securities. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.    For the first quarter of 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was 24.2 percent. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and investments in partnerships, and a decrease in the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains on sales of AIG Life and Retirement's available-for-sale securities.         Results of Operations Highlights      •    AIG Property Casualty posted underwriting income and improved its accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to underwriting improvements and lower catastrophe losses.   •    AIG Life and Retirement continued to actively manage spread income through the low interest rate environment and realized higher returns on alternative investments.   •    Our investment portfolio performance, excluding gains recognized in the first quarter of 2012 from our previous investments in ML II, ML III and AIA, improved due to higher partnership income, driven primarily by equity market gains.       81      Table of Contents   ITEM 2. / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following table presents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to after-tax operating income attributable to AIG:                                       Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)      2013      2012            Net income       $ 2,231    $ 3,449      Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense         93      64          Income from continuing operations         2,138      3,385      Net losses on sale of divested businesses         –      2      Legacy FIN 48 and other tax adjustments         626      –      Legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters         (64    )   4      Deferred income tax valuation allowance releases         (786    )   (293 )    Changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities         19      12      Change in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital (gains) losses         54      (23 )    Loss on extinguishment of debt         221      –      Net realized capital (gains) losses         (201    )   199      Non-qualifying derivative hedging losses, excluding net realized capital losses         –      1          After-tax operating income         2,007      3,287      Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests         25      241          After-tax operating income attributable to AIG       $ 1,982    $ 3,046           After-tax operating income attributable to AIG decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to fair value gains on AIG's previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares, ML II, and ML III, discussed above, partially offset by increases in income from insurance operations.  For the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 29.8 percent and 30.2 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income.

Factors that affect operating income for a specific business segment are discussed in the detailed business segment analysis.     First Quarter Pre-tax Income Comparison for 2013 and 2012     AIG Property Casualty — Pre-tax income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase in pre-tax income was the result of underwriting income in the first quarter of 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in the first quarter of 2012 due to rate increases and enhanced risk selection, favorable reserve development, and lower catastrophe losses. Net investment income increased due to the strong performance of equity partnership investments.     AIG Life and Retirement — Pre-tax income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, due to lower mortality costs and higher returns on alternative investments, partially offset by fair value gains on ML II in the first quarter of 2012. Results benefitted from our efforts to actively manage spread income and increases in policy fees as a result of growth in variable annuity assets under management. Net realized capital gains were $156 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to Net realized capital losses of $466 million in the first quarter of   83      Table of Contents   ITEM 2. / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2012. This improvement was due to lower other-than-temporary impairments and lower fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives.    Other Operations — Other Operations recorded a pre-tax loss in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a pre-tax gain in the first quarter of 2012 due to a loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the redemption of and cash tender offers for certain securities in the first quarter of 2013 and fair value and realized gains in 2012 from our previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares and ML III.

Commercial Insurance provides insurance solutions for large and small businesses. Commercial lines products are distributed through a network of independent retail and wholesale brokers, branches, and through an independent agency network in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions.    Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Consumer Insurance products are distributed through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet.  The   Other category consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including excess workers' compensation written on a stand-alone basis, asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior) and certain environmental liability businesses written prior to 2004. It also includes a portion of AIG Property Casualty expenses relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, and other income (expense).  See Item 1. Business — AIG Property Casualty in AIG's 2012 Annual Report for further discussion of AIG Property Casualty's products and geographic regions where it distributes its products.  We assess the performance of our operating segments based on operating income (loss), loss ratio, acquisition ratio, general operating expense ratio and combined ratio.   85      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We are developing new value-based metrics that provide management with measures to evaluate our profitability, such as a risk-adjusted profitability model. Along with underwriting results, this risk-adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital and net investment income. We believe that such performance measures will allow us to better assess the true economic returns of our business.     AIG Property Casualty First Quarter 2013 Highlights     Net premiums written decreased by four percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. We now recognize ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period. In addition, the timing of the 2013 catastrophe bond issuance decreased net premiums written. Excluding the impact of these items, Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased by over four percent in the first quarter of 2013, partially offset by a two percent decrease in Consumer Insurance due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.  The   loss ratio improved by 4.7 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit from positive pricing trends, the continued effect of the execution of our strategic initiatives which we began implementing in the second half of 2011, as well as lower catastrophe losses. Favorable net prior year development, including related premium adjustments during the period, contributed approximately one point to the overall decrease in the loss ratio.  The   acquisition ratio decreased by 0.5 points due to decreases in the Commercial Insurance acquisition ratio, which were partially offset by increases in the Consumer Insurance acquisition ratio.  The  general operating expense ratio increased by 0.4 points due to an increase in personnel-related costs which was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.     Net investment income increased by 11 percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the strong performance of equity partnership investments.   86      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    AIG Property Casualty Results     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty results:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)     2013      2012      Percentage Change            Commercial Insurance                         Underwriting results:                         Net premiums written      $ 4,903    $ 5,223      (6 )%    (Increase) decrease in unearned premiums         225      (61 )   NM          Net premiums earned         5,128      5,162     (1 )    Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred         3,329      3,730     (11 )    Acquisition expenses         838      928     (10 )    General operating expense         565      590     (4 )          Underwriting income (loss)         396      (86 )   NM      Net investment income         645      731     (12 )          Operating income      $ 1,041    $ 645     61 %          Consumer Insurance                         Underwriting results:                         Net premiums written       $ 3,532    $ 3,597      (2 )%    Increase in unearned premiums         (124    )   (101 )   (23 )          Net premiums earned         3,408      3,496     (3 )    Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred         1,969      2,030     (3 )    Acquisition expenses         850      829     3      General operating expense         534      519     3          Underwriting income         55      118     (53 )    Net investment income         98      116     (16 )          Operating income      $ 153    $ 234      (35 )%          Other                         Underwriting results:                         Net premiums written       $ 2    $ —     NM %    Decrease in unearned premiums         20      30     (33 )          Net premiums earned         22      30     (27 )    Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred         115      149     (23 )    General operating expense         127      93     37          Underwriting loss         (220     )   (212 )   (4 )    Net investment income         615      376     64          Operating income         395      164     141      Net realized capital gains (losses)         12      (135 )   NM      Other income — net         3      2     50          Pre-tax income      $ 410    $ 31     NM %          Total AIG Property Casualty                         Underwriting results:                         Net premiums written       $ 8,437    $ 8,820      (4 )%    (Increase) decrease in unearned premiums         121      (132 )   NM          Net premiums earned         8,558      8,688     (1 )    Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred         5,413      5,909     (8 )    Acquisition expenses         1,688      1,757     (4 )    General operating expense         1,226      1,202     2          Underwriting income (loss)         231      (180 )   NM      Net investment income         1,358      1,223     11          Operating income         1,589      1,043     52      Net realized capital gains (losses)         12      (135 )   NM      Other income — net         3      2     50          Pre-tax income      $ 1,604    $ 910     76 %            87      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                            * The operations reported as part of Other do not have meaningful levels of Net premiums written.     AIG Property Casualty Results  Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in both underwriting income and net investment income. We generated underwriting income in the first quarter of 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in same period in the prior year reflecting improved current accident year losses, favorable prior year loss development, as well as lower catastrophe losses. Net investment income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the strong performance of equity partnership investments. The asset diversification strategies that we executed during 2012 enabled us to maintain similar yields in the remainder of the portfolio despite the continued low interest rate environment in 2013. Net prior year favorable (adverse) loss development including premium adjustments was $52 million and $(47) million for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively.  See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense for further discussion of prior year development.  Acquisition expenses decreased primarily due to the timing of certain guaranty funds and other assessments in Commercial Insurance, which were partially offset by higher commission rates in Consumer Insurance.  General operating expenses increased due to an increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans of $34 million, primarily as a result of accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible individuals for the 2013 plan awards and increases in accruals for previously granted awards based on our stock price performance, as well as a $42 million increase due to the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan. This was offset by decreases in bad debt expense, and lower expenses related to strategic initiatives. Bad debt expense and strategic initiatives expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2013 by $53 million and $9 million, respectively, compared to the same period in the prior year.    Commercial Insurance Results  Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in underwriting income partially offset by a decrease in allocated net investment income due to a decrease in risk-free rates. Commercial Insurance generated underwriting income in the first quarter of 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to improved current accident year losses, rate increases and enhanced risk selection, favorable prior year loss development, and lower catastrophe losses.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of guaranty funds and other assessments.  General operating expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was partially offset by the employee incentive plan increases previously discussed.   88      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Consumer Insurance Results  Operating income decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in both underwriting income and allocated net investment income. Underwriting income decreased due to increases in acquisition expenses, investment in strategic business expansion in growth economy nations, and the change in business mix towards higher value products. Underwriting income for the first quarter of 2012 included a benefit of approximately $45 million from refinements to certain actuarial assumptions within the A&H line of business. Net investment income decreased due to a decrease in risk-free rates.  Acquisition expenses increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in commission expenses, reflecting new production growth in A&H products in Asia, which incur higher commission rates.  General operating expenses increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the employee incentive plan increases previously discussed and the strategic expansion in growth economy nations.     AIG Property Casualty Net Premiums Written     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty net premiums written by major line of business:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)     2013      2012      Percentage Change            Commercial Insurance                         Casualty       $ 2,244    $ 2,352      (5 )%    Property         683      972     (30 )    Specialty         972      990     (2 )    Financial lines         1,004      909     10          Total net premiums written      $ 4,903    $ 5,223      (6 )%          Consumer Insurance                         Accident & Health      $ 1,793    $ 1,807      (1 )%    Personal lines         1,739      1,790     (3 )          Total net premiums written      $ 3,532    $ 3,597      (2 )%          Other         2      –     NM          Total AIG Property Casualty net premiums written       $ 8,437    $ 8,820      (4 )%               89                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Commercial Insurance Net Premiums Written  During the first quarter of 2013, Commercial Insurance continued to focus on the execution of its strategic objectives.  Casualty net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the execution of our strategy to improve loss ratios. Our enhanced risk selection process, and adherence to pricing targets resulted in the non-renewal of approximately $80 million of net premiums written in the first quarter of 2013, primarily within the workers' compensation business in the Americas and within the Primary Casualty business in EMEA. We also entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement in the U.S. for the Excess Casualty business that decreased net premiums written by $72 million in 2013. We implemented rate increases in retained business, especially in the U.S., that partially offset these premium decreases.  Growth in Property new business and changes to our per-risk reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, was more than offset by additional ceded premiums written in the first quarter of 2013, as described below. Catastrophe-exposed business in the Americas also benefitted from rate increases.  Effective January 1, 2013, we recognize the annual ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period. Previously, we recognized ceded premiums written on these agreements based on the quarterly contractual remittance requirements, and recorded an adjustment at the end of the contract term to reflect the actual ceded premiums written amounts. This change resulted in the acceleration of ceded premiums written to earlier quarters, but had only a de minimis effect on net premiums earned. For the first quarter of 2013, ceded premiums written increased by $398 million compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of this change. The impact on net premiums written from this change will reverse throughout the rest of 2013.  Net premiums written also reflected the timing of a 2013 catastrophe bond issuance. We have continued the strategy, adopted in 2010, to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. During the first quarter of 2013, as part of this strategy, we secured a three-year catastrophe bond providing for up to $400 million in protection on U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes to the extent both industry losses and our actual losses exceed specific thresholds. The bond transaction reduced net premiums written by $96 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our previous catastrophe bond issuance occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011.    Specialty net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to rate pressure in the European aerospace and marine markets. This decrease was slightly offset by rate increases in small-and medium-sized enterprises and environmental business. Additionally, we continue to restructure our reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, which increased net premiums written by $40 million in the first quarter of 2013.    Financial lines net premiums written increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products as well as an improved rate environment globally. Global professional indemnity net premiums written increased by $35 million due to the restructuring of our reinsurance program, as part of our decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, as well as by improved rates and strong new business growth.    Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written  Consumer Insurance net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen and the effect of the excess of loss reinsurance ceded written premiums discussed above. Excluding these items, net premiums written in the first quarter of 2013 increased compared to the same period in the prior year as the business continued to build momentum through multiple distribution channels and continuing focus on direct marketing. In the first quarter of 2013, net premiums written generated by direct marketing increased by approximately 8 percent compared to the same period in the prior year, and accounted for approximately 16 percent of Consumer Insurance business.  Excluding foreign exchange,  A&H net premiums written increased as a result of our focus on the growth of Fuji Life products, direct marketing, and individual A&H in Asia. In addition, travel business continued to increase in most geographies across the globe, including in EMEA. Americas continued its strategy of repositioning U.S. direct   90      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  marketing operations and maintaining our pricing discipline and underwriting targets. As a result, several programs in the group personal accident business were not renewed in the first quarter of 2013.  Excluding foreign exchange,  Personal lines net premiums written increased as a result of growth in automobile products and the continued execution of our strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business in non-automobile products. Automobile products reported growth in EMEA as our market share continued to improve over local competition in key countries. Non-automobile products also reported continued growth, including increases in Europe Personal lines specialty products and personal property in Asia due to our focus on diversifying the global product mix. These increases were partially offset by a $47 million increase in ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements previously discussed. In addition, the timing of the catastrophe bond issuance reduced net premiums written by $20 million.     AIG Property Casualty Net Premiums Written by Region     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty's net premiums written by region:                                                    Three Months Ended March 31,   (in millions)      2013      2012      Percentage Change in U.S. dollars      Percentage Change in Original Currency            Commercial Insurance:                               Americas      $ 2,878    $ 3,079      (7 )%    (7 )%    Asia Pacific         501      452     11     16      EMEA         1,524      1,692     (10 )   (11 )          Total net premiums written      $ 4,903    $ 5,223      (6 )%    (6 )%          Consumer Insurance:                               Americas       $ 975    $ 1,028      (5 )%    (4 )%    Asia Pacific         1,973      2,023     (2 )   5      EMEA         584      546     7     6          Total net premiums written      $ 3,532    $ 3,597      (2 )%   3 %          Other:                               Americas       $ 2    $ –     NM %   NM %          Total net premiums written      $ 2    $ –     NM %   NM %          Total AIG Property Casualty:                               Americas       $ 3,855    $ 4,107      (6 )%    (6 )%    Asia Pacific         2,474      2,475     –     7      EMEA         2,108      2,238     (6 )   (7 )          Total net premiums written      $ 8,437    $ 8,820      (4 )%    (3 )%            91      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The Americas net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of the increase in ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements discussed above of approximately $210 million, and approximately $120 million due to the timing of a catastrophe bond issuance. These items, which affected both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, were partially offset by rate increases in Commercial Insurance and by continued growth in the personal property and private client group in Consumer Insurance.    Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding foreign exchange, net premiums written increased primarily due to an increase in Consumer Insurance, reflecting growth of Fuji Life products and direct marketing business in Japan. The expansion in Asia Pacific countries outside of Japan also continued in the first quarter of 2013, supported by growth in individual personal accident insurance, direct marketing and personal lines products. Commercial Insurance increased in the region primarily due to organic growth and rate increases in Property, Specialty, and Casualty. In addition, retention in Property and Specialty increased during the first quarter of 2013.     EMEA net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the change in methodology for recognizing ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements discussed above of approximately $230 million, partially offset by Commercial Insurance growth due to new business growth, and rate improvements on retained business, as well as modest growth in Consumer Insurance travel, warranty, and specialty personal lines products.   92      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    AIG Property Casualty Underwriting Ratios  The following table presents the AIG Property Casualty combined ratios based on GAAP data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:                                             Three Months Ended March 31,     2013      2012      Increase (Decrease)            Commercial Insurance                         Loss ratio         64.9      72.3     (7.4 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums         (0.6     )   (1.5 )   0.9      Prior year development net of premium adjustments         1.1      (0.5 )   1.6          Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted         65.4      70.3     (4.9 )          Acquisition ratio         16.3      18.0     (1.7 )    General operating expense ratio         11.0      11.4     (0.4 )          Expense ratio         27.3      29.4     (2.1 )          Combined ratio         92.2      101.7     (9.5 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums         (0.6    )   (1.5 )   0.9      Prior year development net of premium adjustments         1.1      (0.5 )   1.6          Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted         92.7      99.7     (7.0 )          Consumer Insurance                         Loss ratio         57.8      58.1     (0.3 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums         (0.3    )   (0.1 )   (0.2 )    Prior year development net of premium adjustments         1.3      0.4     0.9          Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted         58.8      58.4     0.4          Acquisition ratio         24.9      23.7     1.2      General operating expense ratio         15.7      14.9     0.8          Expense ratio         40.6      38.6     2.0          Combined ratio         98.4      96.7     1.7      Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums         (0.3    )   (0.1 )   (0.2 )    Prior year development net of premium adjustments         1.3      0.4     0.9          Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted         99.4      97.0     2.4          Total AIG Property Casualty                         Loss ratio         63.3      68.0     (4.7 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums         (0.5    )   (0.9 )   0.4      Prior year development net of premium adjustments         0.4      (0.6 )   1.0      Change in discount         –      (0.2 )   0.2          Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted         63.2      66.3     (3.1 )          Acquisition ratio         19.7      20.2     (0.5 )    General operating expense ratio         14.3      13.9     0.4          Expense ratio         34.0      34.1     (0.1 )          Combined ratio         97.3      102.1     (4.8 )    Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums         (0.5    )   (0.9 )   0.4      Prior year development net of premium adjustments         0.4      (0.6 )   1.0      Change in discount         –      (0.2 )   0.2          Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted         97.2      100.4     (3.2 )            93                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Given the nature of the lines of business and the expenses included in Other, we have determined that the traditional underwriting measures of loss ratio, acquisition ratio, general operating expense ratio and combined ratio do not provide an appropriate measure of underwriting performance. Therefore, these ratios are not separately presented for Other.  The following table presents AIG Property Casualty accident year catastrophe losses by major event, and severe losses:                                              2013      2012       Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      # of Events      Commercial Insurance      Consumer Insurance      Total      # of Events      Commercial Insurance      Consumer Insurance      Total            Event:*                                                        U.S. Windstorms       2        $ 24       $ 7       $ 31      2   $ 76   $ 4   $ 80      Australia Flood       1          9          1          10      –     –     –     –          Claims and claim expenses              33          8          41            76     4     80      Reinstatement premiums              –          –          –            –     –     –          Total catastrophe-related charges       3        $ 33       $ 8       $ 41      2   $ 76   $ 4   $ 80          Total severe losses       3       $ 60       $ –       $ 60      2   $ 42   $ –   $ 42           * Events shown in the above table are catastrophic insured events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each. Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophe individual first party losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance.   94      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Commercial Insurance Ratios  The improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2013, reflects the realization of benefits from the continued execution of our multi-faceted strategy to enhance risk selection, pricing discipline, exposure management and claims processing. Although the execution of these strategies resulted in a reduction of Casualty net premiums written, it also improved the accident year loss ratio as we remediated our primary and excess Casualty books in both the Americas and EMEA regions. Financial lines improved due to rate strengthening, restructuring and re-underwriting of certain products. Severe losses in the first quarter of 2013 totaled approximately $60 million, compared to $42 million in the first quarter of 2012, and are included in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted.  The acquisition ratio decreased by 1.7 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to insurance-related assessments.  The general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of $55 million, slightly offset by the employee incentive compensation plan increases previously discussed of $26 million.     Consumer Insurance Ratios  The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. The underwriting income for the first quarter of 2012 included a benefit of approximately $45 million from refinements to certain actuarial assumptions within the A&H line of business. This was partially offset by improvements in Personal lines, primarily automobile, as a result of rate actions taken in prior years in Japan, as well as by improvements in Europe specialty business and in the U.S. private client group.  The acquisition ratio increased by 1.2 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher commissions in lines of business targeted for growth and an increase in direct marketing expenses. Overall, net commissions increased by 1.2 percent, driven by higher growth in Fuji Life products and individual A&H. Direct marketing costs increased by approximately 22 percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.8 points primarily as a result of the employee incentive compensation increases previously discussed.     Other Category  We incurred higher costs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily related to our implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan, which contributed approximately 0.6 points to the AIG Property Casualty general operating expense ratio. We continue to invest in a number of strategic initiatives, including the implementation of global finance and information systems, compliance with the regulatory requirements of the FRB, legal entity restructuring, and underwriting and claims improvement initiatives. The costs of these initiatives, which are not specific to either Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance, are reported as part of the Other category. In the first quarter of 2013, such costs totaled $40 million, representing a decrease of approximately $12 million over the same period in 2012.     AIG Property Casualty Investing and Other Results     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty's investing and other results:                            Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)     2013      2012      Percentage Change            Net investment income                         Commercial Insurance      $ 645    $ 731      (12 )%    Consumer Insurance         98      116     (16 )    Other         615      376     64          Total net investment income         1,358      1,223     11      Net realized capital gains (losses)         12      (135 )   NM      Other income — net         3      2     50          Investing and other results      $ 1,373    $ 1,090     26 %            95      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We manage and account for our invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements. Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as the Other category. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments.  Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and the Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to the Other category. Commencing in the first quarter of 2013, we began applying similar duration and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) to the allocated capital of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance as is applied to loss reserves.  Net realized capital gains (losses) and Other income (expense) — net are not allocated to Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, but are reported as part of the Other category.    Net Investment Income  Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the interest rate environment and changes in overall asset allocation. Certain of our structured securities are accounted for under the fair value option, which may also increase the volatility of our net investment income. The increase in the fair value of structured securities in the first quarter of 2013 was offset by a decrease in interest income from available for sale securities. Net investment income increased by $135 million or 11 percent, in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the strong performance in equity partnership investments.  Corporate debt securities continues to be our largest asset category. We continued to reduce our concentration in lower yielding tax-exempt municipal bond holdings and focus on risk-weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities. This asset diversification has achieved an increase in average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity investments were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to execute our investment strategy in 2013 to meet our liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  Net investment income from investment categories other than debt securities increased by $133 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Approximately $125 million was attributed to the strong performance of equity partnership investments, following an 8 percent increase in the S&P 500 Index. Income from the life settlement portfolios also increased by approximately $35 million during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.     Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains in the first quarter of 2013 were driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities of $71 million, partially offset by impairment charges on life settlement contracts of approximately $49 million as a result of decreases in their estimated fair value and other-than-temporary impairment charges of $18 million.  Net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2012 were driven by impairment charges of $58 million on life settlement contracts and other-than-temporary impairments of $94 million attributable to RMBS and $98 million attributable to partnership investments, which were offset in part by the gains on fixed maturity securities of $169 million.   96                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense     The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for AIG Property Casualty as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in Other operations.

AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. We regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years' estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years' estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.  The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance, less applicable discount for future investment income.

While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of March 31, 2013. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  The following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves:                                       Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)     2013      2012            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year       $ 68,782    $ 70,825      Foreign exchange effect         (516     )   90      Change due to NICO reinsurance transaction         44      9      Losses and loss expenses incurred:                   Current year, undiscounted         5,411      5,840      Prior years, undiscounted*         (53     )   39      Change in discount         5      19          Losses and loss expenses incurred         5,363      5,898          Losses and loss expenses paid         6,848      6,949          Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period      $ 66,825    $ 69,873           * See tables below for details of prior year development by business unit, accident year and major class of business.   98      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following tables summarize development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years, net of reinsurance:                          Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)     2013      2012            Prior accident year development by accident year:                   Accident Year                   2012       $ (38    ) $ –      2011         (27     )   (156 )    2010         (19    )   (50 )    2009         (31    )   5      2008         15      7      2007         (1    )   (6 )    2006         8      (1 )    2005         4      34      2004         (13    )   (33 )    2003 and prior         49      239          Total      $ (53     ) $ 39           For certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims), losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to AIG.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.  For the three-month period ended March 31, 2013, the net favorable development was driven by reserve decreases on claims in the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments that was partially offset by net adverse development in reserves in Other. The net favorable development in Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to the reduction of reserves on large excess casualty cases and favorable development in domestic property exposures, and partially offset by adverse development in the primary Casualty lines. The favorable development in Consumer Insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe and non-catastrophe exposures in Personal lines. The adverse development in Other included adverse development on legacy asbestos and environmental exposures (1986 and prior), and adverse development on run-off environmental exposures (1987 – 2003).  For the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in Commercial Insurance and Other, partially offset by net favorable development in reserves in Consumer Insurance. The net adverse development in Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on large excess casualty cases, primarily casualty and environmental business (policies written after 1987), partially offset by favorable development in domestic property exposures and catastrophe losses. The favorable development in Consumer Insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe losses in Personal lines. The adverse development in Other included adverse development on run-off environmental exposures (1987 – 2003).  AIG Property Casualty recognized additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $10 million and $6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and incurred reinstatement premiums of $14 million in 2013 associated with the development on prior years' catastrophes.  See AIG Property Casualty Results herein and Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves     The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  As described more fully in the 2012 Annual Report, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis performed periodically. In the first quarter of 2013, a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount was recognized. In the first quarter of 2013, AIG increased its gross and net environmental reserves by $18 million. This development is primarily attributable to development on one large account expected to be settled in the near future.  In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, AIG Property Casualty also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $134 million gross and $111 million net as of March 31, 2013. The asbestos reserves relating to non-U.S. risks written by non-U.S. entities were $140 million gross and $116 million net as of December 31, 2012.   100      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:                                    2013      2012       As of or for the Three Months Ended March 31,   (in millions)          Gross      Net      Gross      Net            Asbestos:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year      $ 4,896       $ 427    $ 5,226   $ 537      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                                Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts         –          45      –     24      Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts(a)         –          (1     )   –     (15 )          Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance         –          44      –     9          Loss and loss expenses incurred:                                Undiscounted         –          6      –     –      Change in discount         12          5      43     20          Losses and loss expenses incurred(b)         12          11      43     20          Losses and loss expenses paid(b)         (167    )       (80     )   (115 )   (57 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period       $ 4,741       $ 402    $ 5,154   $ 509          Environmental:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year       $ 309       $ 163    $ 204   $ 119      Losses and loss expenses incurred         18          18      50     25          Losses and loss expenses paid         (18     )       (13     )   (13 )   (10 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period       $ 309       $ 168    $ 241   $ 134          Combined:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year       $ 5,205       $ 590    $ 5,430   $ 656      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                                Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts         –          45      –     24      Re-estimation of amount recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts         –          (1    )   –     (15 )          Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance         –          44      –     9          Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                Undiscounted         18          24      50     25      Change in discount         12          5      43     20          Losses and loss expenses incurred         30          29      93     45          Losses and loss expenses paid         (185     )       (93     )   (128 )   (67 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period       $ 5,050       $ 570    $ 5,395   $ 643           (a) Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts includes effect of changes in reserve estimates and changes in discount.

These changes did not affect operating income or pre-tax income. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       AIG Life and Retirement Operating Income  Operating income increased in the first quarter of 2013 principally due to higher returns on alternative investments, benefits from our efforts to actively manage spread income, the impact of favorable separate account performance on policy fees, policyholder benefit expenses and DAC amortization and lower mortality costs. This increase was partially offset by the absence of fair value gains on ML II that were recognized in the first quarter of 2012.  Premiums were essentially unchanged in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 as higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums were offset by lower term insurance and immediate annuity premiums.  Policy fees increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 as a result of growth in variable annuity assets under management from higher net flows and separate account performance, driven in large part by higher equity markets.  Net investment income was essentially unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2012 as higher returns on alternative investments, higher call and tender income and a fair value gain of $31 million on the investment in PICC were offset by ML II fair value gains in the first quarter of 2012 and lower base yields of 20 basis points in the first quarter of 2013. Recent investment purchases have been made at yields lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio.  Other income primarily consists of commission revenues earned by affiliated broker dealers from the sale of investments and variable annuities. The increase in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily as a result of the acquisition of Woodbury Financial in November 2012.  Policyholder benefits and claims incurred were essentially unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2012.  Interest credited decreased in the first quarter of 2013 due to active crediting rate management actions that included lowering renewal credited rates and maintaining disciplined new business pricing.  Amortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased in the first quarter of 2013 consistent with lower fixed annuity reserves.  Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased from the first quarter of 2012 due to higher commission expenses associated with brokerage activities as a result of the acquisition of Woodbury Financial.   105      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Retail Operating Income  Retail operating income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to lower mortality costs, higher returns on alternative investments and lower DAC amortization, partially offset by ML II fair value gains in the first quarter of 2012.  Premiums decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to lower term insurance and immediate annuity premiums.  Policy fees increased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 as a result of growth in variable annuity assets under management due to higher net flows and separate account performance driven in large part by higher equity markets.  Net investment income was essentially unchanged in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, as higher returns on alternative investments, fair value gains on trading securities, including PICC, and higher call and tender income in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 were offset by fair value gains on ML II of $153 million in the first quarter of 2012.  The decrease in policyholder benefits and claims incurred reflected lower mortality costs for individual life insurance compared with the first quarter of 2012.  Amortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 consistent with lower fixed annuity reserves. The favorable separate account returns did not result in unlocking assumptions of estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC, VOBA and SIA in the first quarter of 2013. An unlocking could occur if favorable equity market performance continues for the remainder of 2013; however, such positive unlocking is not expected to be significant to AIG Life and Retirement's operating results.    Institutional Operating Income  Institutional operating income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to higher returns on alternative investments and higher gains on trading securities, partially offset by ML II fair value gains recorded in the first quarter of 2012.  Premiums increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums.  Net investment income was essentially unchanged in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 as higher returns on alternative investments were offset by fair value gains on ML II of $93 million in the first quarter of 2012.  Policyholder benefits and claims incurred increased primarily as a result of higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums.  Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of ongoing actions to actively manage interest crediting rates on new and renewal Group Retirement business and maintaining disciplined new business pricing.  Amortization of deferred acquisition costs was essentially unchanged in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012.  Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to higher marketing and distribution expenses associated with growth initiatives related to group retirement products and institutional markets.    Legal Settlements  In the first quarter of 2013, we recorded income of $108 million from a settlement with a financial institution that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which AIG and its subsidiaries realized losses during the financial crisis.   106      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Changes in Fair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Designated to Hedge Living Benefit Liabilities  AIG Life and Retirement has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatilities related to embedded derivative liabilities contained in guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities. We substantially hedge our exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a portion of our interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, we began purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce our interest rate risk exposure over time. As a result of increases in interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities, the fair value of the U.S. Treasury securities used for hedging, net of financing costs, decreased by $29 million.    Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains were $156 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $466 million in the first quarter of 2012. While gains from sales activity were comparable to 2012, results were positively impacted by foreign currency transaction gains in the first quarter of 2013, lower other-than-temporary impairments and lower fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of hedges. The large embedded derivative losses in 2012 were primarily due to declining credit spreads in the first quarter of 2012.    Changes in Benefit Reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA Related to Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  In conjunction with a program to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards, we sold investments in the first quarter of both 2013 and 2012. These and other sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition on certain long-term payout annuity contracts of $102 million in the first quarter of 2013, and $87 million in the same period of 2012, which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized (included in AOCI) to actual loss recognition (included in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred) and, to a much lesser extent, transferred shadow DAC (included in AOCI) to Amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Additional sales of such securities are contemplated in the remainder of 2013, which could result in additional loss recognition. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves. In addition, due to the reinvestment of the assets at lower yields, earnings related to this payout annuity block of business are expected to decline in the reminder of 2013.  The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in AIG Life and Retirement DAC/VOBA:                                      Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012            Balance, beginning of year       $ 5,672    $ 6,502          Acquisition costs deferred         179      197      Amortization expense         (153  )    (164 )    Change in net unrealized gains on securities         (259  )    (251 )    Other         (5  )    –          Balance, end of period      $ 5,434    $ 6,284           Because AIG Life and Retirement operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest yield assumptions in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.  DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and group retirement products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant judgment. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for additional information on DAC and VOBA recoverability.   107                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Premiums  Premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums and deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts, GICs and mutual funds.  The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:                                      Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012            Premiums and deposits       $ 5,580    $ 5,560      Deposits         (4,804  )    (4,794 )    Other         (156  )    (152 )          Premiums      $ 620    $ 614           The following table presents the components of premiums and deposits by line of business for AIG Life and Retirement:                                             Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012      Percentage Change            Premiums and deposits:                         Retail                         Life Insurance & A&H      $ 835    $ 832     – %    Fixed Annuities         376      584     (36 )    Retirement Income Solutions         1,413      1,159     22      Retail Mutual Funds         833      749     11      Closed Blocks         29      39     (26 )          Total Retail      $ 3,486    $ 3,363     4 %          Institutional                         Group Retirement      $ 1,740    $ 1,844      (6 )%    Institutional Markets         181      181     –      Group Benefits         173      172     1          Total Institutional         2,094      2,197     (5 )          Total premiums and deposits       $ 5,580    $ 5,560     – %               108      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Total premiums and deposits were essentially unchanged in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, as significant increases in retirement income solutions were offset by substantial decreases in fixed annuities.  Retirement income solutions deposits increased due to innovative product enhancements and expanded distribution as well as a more favorable competitive environment. Retail mutual fund sales increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, principally driven by SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.'s Focused Dividend Strategy product offering. Fixed annuity deposits continued to be negatively affected by the sustained low interest rate environment as consumers are reluctant to purchase these products at the relatively low crediting rates currently offered. Group retirement deposits (which include deposits into mutual funds and fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) decreased due to lower levels of individual rollover deposits and periodic deposits in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, partially offset by higher mutual fund deposits. The low interest rate environment has affected group retirement deposits, resulting in lower levels of deposits into fixed options. Premiums from life insurance products were unchanged in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012.    Net Flows  The following table summarizes net flows for fixed annuities, retirement income solutions, retail mutual funds and group retirement:                                      Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012            Net flows*                   Fixed annuities       $ (999  )  $ (818 )    Retirement income solutions         571      335      Retail mutual funds         301      370      Group retirement         (117  )    227          Total net flows      $ (244  )  $ 114            * Annuities net flows represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows on retail mutual funds are deposits less withdrawals. Net flows presented excludes net flows activity on certain closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities reserves totaling $6 billion.   Overall net flows were negative in the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by lower deposits and higher surrenders for group retirement products driven by actions we took to mitigate a prolonged low interest rate environment. Net flows also declined due to lower fixed annuity deposits compared to the first quarter of 2012, resulting from the low interest rate environment. These decreases were offset by improvements in net flows for individual variable annuities due to both increases in deposits and favorable surrender experience.   109      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table presents AIG Life and Retirement insurance reserves and retail and group mutual funds:                                      Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012            Retail                   Balance at beginning of period, gross      $ 123,699    $ 120,396      Premiums and deposits         3,486      3,363      Surrenders and withdrawals         (2,497  )    (2,371 )    Death, and other contract benefits         (795  )    (893 )          Subtotal         194      99      Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees         1,745      1,911      Cost of funds         581      612      Other reserve changes         486      (292 )          Balance at end of period         126,705      122,726      Reserves related to unrealized investment appreciation         370      369      Reinsurance ceded         (1,497  )    (1,535 )          Total insurance reserves and mutual funds      $ 125,578    $ 121,560          Institutional                   Balance at beginning of period, gross      $ 110,494    $ 103,315      Premiums and deposits         2,094      2,197      Surrenders and withdrawals         (3,012  )    (2,452 )    Death, and other contract benefits         (477  )    (498 )          Subtotal         (1,395  )    (753 )    Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees         3,093      3,928      Cost of funds         398      410      Other reserve changes         12      (76 )          Balance at end of period         112,602      106,824      Reserves related to unrealized investment appreciation         2,004      1,895      Reinsurance ceded         (222  )    (269 )          Total insurance reserves and mutual funds      $ 114,384      108,450          Total AIG Life and Retirement:                   Balance at beginning of period, gross      $ 234,193    $ 223,711      Premiums and deposits         5,580      5,560      Surrenders and withdrawals         (5,509  )    (4,823 )    Death, and other contract benefits         (1,272  )    (1,391 )          Subtotal         (1,201  )    (654 )    Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees         4,838      5,839      Cost of funds         979      1,022      Other reserve changes         498      (368 )          Balance at end of period         239,307      229,550      Reserves related to unrealized investment appreciation         2,374      2,264      Reinsurance ceded         (1,719  )    (1,804 )          Total insurance reserves and mutual funds      $ 239,962    $ 230,010            110      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table presents selected reserves by surrender charge category and surrender rates:                                         2013      2012       At March 31,    (in millions)      Group Retirement Products*      Individual Fixed Annuities      Retirement Income Solutions      Group Retirement Products*      Individual Fixed Annuities      Retirement Income Solutions            No surrender charge      $ 57,739       $ 28,938       $ 13,019    $ 55,668   $ 24,097   $ 12,233      0% – 2%         1,356          2,688          4,656      1,369     3,735     4,490      Greater than 2% – 4%         1,505          3,483          2,131      1,246     4,588     2,420      Greater than 4%         5,097          20,153          12,941      4,367     25,295     9,354      Non-surrenderable         664          2,921          860      480     3,292     527          Total reserves       $ 66,361       $ 58,183       $ 33,607    $ 63,130   $ 61,007   $ 29,024          Surrender rates         9.0  %        6.6  %        8.9  %    8.4 %   6.3 %   11.6 %            * Excludes mutual funds of $12.8 billion and $10.7 billion at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.     Low Interest Rate Environment  A variety of factors affect AIG Life and Retirement's businesses, and the life insurance and annuity industry in general, during a prolonged low interest rate environment. Declining interest rates result in higher fair values of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities and may result in improved persistency of certain lines of business. A sustained low interest rate environment may also result in lower sales of fixed annuities and other products and lower net investment spreads as portfolio cash flows are reinvested at lower rates (spread compression). We have taken a number of actions to mitigate these impacts, as discussed below.     AIG Life and Retirement has addressed the impact of sustained low interest rates with a number of actions taken on both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet:    •Opportunistic investment in structured securities to increase yields  •Continued disciplined approach to new business pricing  •Active management of renewal credited rates  •Re-priced certain life insurance and annuity products to reflect current low rate environment   •Re-filed certain products to continue lowering minimum rate guarantees   •Included product limits where appropriate to minimize exposure to low interest rates  As a result of these actions, we estimate that the effect of interest rates remaining at or near current levels through the end of 2013 on pre-tax operating income would not be material, and would be modestly more significant with respect to 2014 results.      Opportunistic Investments: The majority of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities consists of intermediate- and long-term fixed maturity securities. We generally purchase assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. Opportunistic investments in structured securities, private placement corporate debt securities and mortgage loans continue to be made to improve yields, increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment.     Disciplined New Business Pricing: New fixed annuity sales have declined in the first quarter of 2013 relative to the first quarter of 2012, due to the relatively low crediting rates offered as a result of our disciplined approach to new business. However, even in the current interest rate environment, we continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads. New sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on   111      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  new non-indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted net investment spreads.    Active Management of Renewal Credited Rates: The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in our products may have the effect, in a continued low interest rate environment, of reducing our spreads and thus reducing future profitability. Although we partially mitigate this interest rate risk through our asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. Our annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We have adjusted, and will continue to adjust crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in-force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees. In addition to annuity and universal life products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment.  As indicated in the table below, approximately 73 percent of our annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of March 31, 2013, an increase from 61 percent at December 31, 2012. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of March 31, 2013 ranging from 1 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products.

To the extent that we cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, current products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower rates as permitted under state insurance product regulations.      Other Operations  AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty, GCM, DIB, Retained Interests and Corporate & Other (after allocations to AIG's business segments) as presented below.   112      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    Mortgage Guaranty (United Guaranty Corporation or UGC) offers private residential mortgage guaranty insurance, which protects mortgage lenders and investors from loss due to borrower default and loan foreclosure. The coverage we provide — which is called mortgage guaranty insurance, mortgage insurance, or simply "MI" — enables borrowers to purchase a house with a modest down payment. This is because MI protects lenders against the increased risk of borrower default related to high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages — those with less than 20 percent equity. In short, MI lets lenders provide more mortgage loans to more people.    Global Capital Markets (GCM) consists of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, or are currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.    Direct Investment Book (DIB) consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the MIP and certain subsidiaries not related to AIG's core insurance operations (including certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP). The management of the DIB portfolio is focused on an orderly wind down to maximize returns consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.    Retained Interests includes the fair value gains or losses, prior to their sale in 2012, of the AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering and the fair value gains or losses, prior to the FRBNY liquidation of ML III assets in 2012, on the retained interest in ML III.    Corporate & Other consists primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, certain expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, the results of AIG's real estate investment operations and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses and properties that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment.

New insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, was approximately $10.6 billion and $6.6 billion in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in new insurance written is the result of the market acceptance of UGC's risk-based pricing model by an increasing number of lenders as well as the addition and expansion of distribution channels. See Outlook — Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion.     Global Capital Markets Operations     GCM's pre-tax and operating income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the GCM derivative assets and liabilities, improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio and a decrease in operating expenses.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $53 million and net credit valuation adjustment losses of $22 million were recognized for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The improvement resulted primarily from lower losses on derivative liabilities, partially offset by lower gains on derivative assets due to less significant tightening of both AIG's credit spreads and counterparty credit spreads in the first quarter of 2013 than in the first quarter of 2012.  Unrealized market valuation gains of $171 million and $140 million were recognized for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The improvement resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio.   115      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Direct Investment Book Results     The following table presents Direct Investment book results:                            Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)     2013      2012      Percentage Change            Operating income (loss)      $ 329    $ (156 )   NM          Net realized capital gains (losses)         (13    )   404     NM      Loss on extinguishment of debt         (4    )   –     NM          Pre-tax income      $ 312    $ 248     26 %             Pre-tax income  Pre-tax income increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to an improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected and fair value appreciation on fair value option hybrid bonds that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by lower net realized capital gains (losses). Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $226 million and net credit valuation adjustment losses of $191 million were recognized for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. The improvement resulted primarily from lower losses on liabilities, partially offset by lower gains on assets due to less significant tightening of both AIG's credit spreads and counterparty credit spreads in the first quarter of 2013 than in the first quarter of 2012.  The change in Net realized capital gains (losses) was driven by realized capital gains of $426 million on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P. in the first quarter of 2012.     Operating Income (Loss)  The DIB reported operating income in 2013 compared to an operating loss in 2012 primarily due to the improvement in net credit valuation adjustments and fair value appreciation discussed above.  The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the DIB (excluding intercompany transactions):                         Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)     2013      2012            Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets:                   Bond trading securities      $ 250    $ 354      Loans and other assets        10      13          Increase in assets        260      367          AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities:                   Notes and bonds payable         (22    )   (201 )    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities         (14     )   (242 )    Guaranteed Investment Agreements        5      (90 )    Other liabilities         (3    )   (25 )          Decrease in liabilities         (34     )   (558 )          Net increase (decrease) to operating income      $ 226    $ (191 )              Retained Interests        Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities Prior to Their Sale  On March 7, 2012, AIG sold approximately 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA and recognized a gain of $0.6 billion. The fair value of AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities increased $1.2 billion during the first quarter of 2012.    Change in Fair Value of ML III Prior to Liquidation  The gain attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the first quarter of 2012 was generally due to tightening credit spreads.   116                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Corporate & Other     Corporate & Other reported higher operating losses in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to an increase in compensation and restructuring expenses. Also, the first quarter of 2012 included a reduction in expense of $36 million resulting from settlements of the liability for the Department of the Treasury's underwriting fees for the sale of AIG Common Stock at amounts lower than had been estimated at the time the accrual was established.      Discontinued Operations  Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations is comprised of the following:                         Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)     2013      2012            ILFC      $ 596    $ 118      Net gain (loss) on sale         (436    )   20          Income from discontinued operations        160      138      Income tax expense        67      74          Income from discontinued operations, net of tax      $ 93    $ 64           Significant items affecting the comparison of results from discontinued operations included pre-tax income of $596 million and a pre-tax loss of $553 million on the sale of ILFC, both reflecting the absence of depreciation and amortization expense because ILFC is classified as held for sale, and a pre-tax gain of $117 million in connection with the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) as a result of a refund of taxes, interest and penalties recognized in the first quarter of 2013.  See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations.     Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)     The following table presents AIG's consolidated comprehensive income (loss):                                             Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012      Percentage Change            Net income      $ 2,231    $ 3,449      (35 )%          Change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments         (1,193     )   2,711     NM      Change in deferred acquisition costs adjustment and other         (311    )   (379 )   18      Change in future policy benefits         424      34     NM      Change in foreign currency translation adjustments         (293     )   87     NM      Change in net derivative gains arising from cash flow hedging activities         –      4     NM      Change in retirement plan liabilities adjustment         43      29     48      Deferred tax asset (liability)         595      (761 )   NM          Other comprehensive income (loss)         (735     )   1,725     NM          Comprehensive income         1,496      5,174     (71 )          Total comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests         25      246     (90 )          Comprehensive income attributable to AIG       $ 1,471    $ 4,928      (70 )%              Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments     The decrease for the first quarter of 2013 was primarily attributable to depreciation in bonds available for sale due to higher rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities partially offset by narrowing spreads of high yield securities.   117      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The increase for the first quarter of 2012 was primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and significant spread tightening partially offset by higher U.S. treasury rates.   Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other     The change in DAC in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 is primarily the result of increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest-sensitive products.   Change in Future Policy Benefits     The change in future policy benefits reserves in the first quarter of 2013 and first quarter 2012 is due to loss reserve recognition in net income resulting from sales of securities in unrealized gain positions as well as decreases in unrealized gains resulting from declines in long term rates. Changes in unrealized appreciation of investments results in changes to future policy benefits which are recorded through Other comprehensive income. This change in future policy benefits assumes that the securities underlying certain traditional long-duration products are sold at their stated aggregate fair value and reinvested at current yields.   Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments     The net loss in the first quarter of 2013 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Japanese yen.   Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities     The decline primarily reflects the de-designation of all derivatives receiving cash flow hedging treatment in 2012.   Change in Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment     The increase for the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.   Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income     In the first quarter of 2013, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other comprehensive loss was 44.7 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to tax effects associated with a decrease in the valuation allowance and the effect of foreign operations.  For the first quarter of 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other comprehensive income was 30.6 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to the effect of foreign operations.   118                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Liquidity and Capital Resources     Overview       Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Identification, and Measurement in the 2012 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.    Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We and our insurance subsidiaries must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both the consolidated company and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM's stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both the consolidated company and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.  Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or capital, or both. In addition, regulatory, and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.  Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders, share purchases and acquisitions.   119      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Liquidity and Capital Resources Management Highlights First Quarter 2013   Sources  •AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries  During the first quarter of 2013, we collected approximately $1.3 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.   Uses  •Debt Reduction  We repaid an aggregate total of $2.9 billion of debt as follows:  We redeemed $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2047 for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued interest.  We purchased, in cash tender offers, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion (an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.0 billion), junior subordinated debentures we issued, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.  We also made other repayments of $0.8 billion which includes repayments by AIG Parent of $190 million.    •Purchase of Warrants We paid approximately $25 million to purchase warrants previously issued in 2008 and 2009 to the Department of the Treasury.   See Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries — AIG Parent — Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent herein for further discussion.     Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash     The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                                      Three Months Ended March 31,   (in millions)      2013      2012            Sources:                   Net cash used in operating activities — continuing operations      $ (777  )  $ (494 )    Net cash provided by operating activities — discontinued operations         628      588      Net cash provided by other investing activities         3,972      10,542      Issuance of other long-term debt         131      2,230      Net cash provided by other financing activities         208      1,588          Total sources         4,162      14,454          Uses:                   Changes in restricted cash         (8     )   (561 )    Changes in policyholder contract balances         (1,196    )   (420 )    Repayments of other long-term debt         (2,861     )   (1,994 )    Repayment of Department of Treasury SPV Preferred Interests         –      (8,636 )    Purchases of AIG Common Stock         –      (3,000 )          Total uses         (4,065     )   (14,611 )          Effect of exchange rate changes on cash         (36    )   (2 )          Increase (decrease) in cash      $ 61    $ (159 )            120      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The following table presents a summary of AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                                      Three Months Ended March 31,    (in millions)      2013      2012            Summary:                   Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities      $ (149     ) $ 94      Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities         3,964      9,981      Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities         (3,718    )   (10,232 )    Effect of exchange rate changes on cash         (36    )   (2 )          Increase (decrease) in cash         61      (159 )    Cash at beginning of year         1,151      1,474      Change in cash of businesses held for sale         15      –          Cash at end of period      $ 1,227    $ 1,315              Operating Cash Flow Activities     Interest payments totaled $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $0.9 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.  Cash used in operating activities of AIG Property Casualty was $0.7 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting the claim payments associated with Storm Sandy.  Cash provided by operating activities of AIG Life and Retirement was $0.4 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting efforts to actively manage spread income.  Cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $0.6 billion for both the first quarter of 2013 and 2012.   Investing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash provided by investing activities for the first quarter of 2013 includes approximately $1.1 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement.  Net cash provided by investing activities in the first quarter of 2012 includes the following items:  •approximately $1.6 billion in distributions from the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II; and   •approximately $6.0 billion in gross proceeds from the sale of 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares.   Financing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash used in financing activities during the first quarter of 2013 includes:  •approximately $1.1 billion to redeem our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2047; and  •approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate to purchase, in cash tender offers, junior subordinated debentures we issued, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.   121      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Net cash used in financing activities during the first quarter of 2012 includes:  •$8.6 billion pay down of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV preferred interests; •$3.0 billion payment for the purchase of 103 million shares of AIG Common Stock; •repayments of $1.2 billion of DIB long-term debt; and •issuances of $2.0 billion of AIG debt to fund the MIP.     Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries      AIG Parent     As of March 31, 2013, AIG Parent had approximately $15.0 billion in liquidity resources. AIG Parent's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and tenor. During the first quarter of 2013, upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchased these publicly traded, intermediate term, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity resources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs.  AIG Parent's primary sources of capital are dividends and distributions from subsidiaries. AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries to facilitate the transfer of capital and liquidity within the consolidated company. We expect these CMAs to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and help manage the flow of capital between AIG Parent and these subsidiaries. We have entered into and expect to enter into additional CMAs with certain other insurance companies in 2013. See AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement below for additional information. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity:                       (In millions)      As of March 31, 2013            Cash and short-term investments(a)(b)      $ 9,121       Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(c)         2,329       Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(d)         3,037       Available capacity under contingent liquidity facility(e)         500             Total AIG Parent liquidity sources      $ 14,987               (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $7.5 billion as of March 31, 2013.  (b) $5.5 billion is allocated toward future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs of DIB and GCM as of March 31, 2013.  (c) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entities securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds.

(e) For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facility, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.    122      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent   Sources During the first quarter of 2013, we collected approximately $1.3 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.  Uses During the first quarter of 2013, we:  •redeemed $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2047 for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest;  •purchased, in cash tender offers:      •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1 billion, approximately 77 million British pounds aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures, approximately 182 million Euro aggregate principal amount of our 8.000% Series A-7 Junior Subordinated Debentures, approximately $79 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and approximately $366 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures;   •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $211 million, approximately $19 million liquidation amount of 81/2% Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities, approximately $114 million liquidation amount of 7.57% Capital Securities, Series A and approximately $29 million liquidation amount of 81/8% Capital Securities, Series B, all of which were issued by statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH; and   •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $61 million, approximately $62 million aggregate principal amount of 5.60% Senior Debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.;    •repaid $190 million of debt, including $181 million of MIP long-term debt, and made interest payments totaling $434 million; and paid approximately $25 million in the aggregate to purchase a warrant issued to the Department of the Treasury in 2008 that provided the right to purchase approximately 2.7 million shares of AIG Common Stock at $50.00 per share and a warrant issued to the Department of Treasury in 2009 that provided the right to purchase up to 150 shares of AIG Common Stock at $0.00002 per share.    AIG Property Casualty     We expect that AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, dispositions of invested assets. AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $6.3 billion as of March 31, 2013. Further, AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient.  AIG Property Casualty paid no dividends to AIG Parent in the first quarter of 2013. AIG Property Casualty paid cash and non-cash dividends totaling $1.0 billion to AIG Parent in the first quarter of 2012.  AIG Parent could be required to provide additional funding to AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances, including:  •large catastrophes that may require AIG to provide additional support to our affected operations;   •downgrades in AIG's credit ratings that could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of AIG's subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations;   123      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   •increases in market interest rates that may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital; and  •other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain, including economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.  In February 2012, AIG Parent, AIG Property Casualty Inc. (formerly known as Chartis Inc.) and certain AIG Property Casualty domestic insurance subsidiaries, entered into a consolidated CMA.  Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries, measured as a group (the Fleet), at or above the specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined by NAIC guidelines and determined based on the subsidiaries' statutory financial statements). As a result, the CMA provides that if the total adjusted capital of the Fleet falls below the specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's total authorized control level RBC, AIG Parent will contribute cash or other instruments admissible under applicable regulations to AIG Property Casualty Inc., which will further contribute such funds to the AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries in the amount necessary to increase the Fleet's total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMA would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG Parent may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate. In addition, the CMA provides that if the total adjusted capital of the Fleet exceeds that same specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's total authorized control level RBC, subject to approval by their respective boards, the AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of:  (i) the amount (to be determined by AIG Property Casualty Inc.) necessary to reduce the Fleet's projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or  (ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law.  The CMA does not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board or regulatory approval, to reduce the Fleet's projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMA would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. On February 20, 2013, the CMA was amended to exclude deferred tax assets from the calculation of total adjusted capital. As a result, the specified minimum percentage decreased from 350 percent to 325 percent.  For the first quarter of 2013, no dividends were paid pursuant to the CMA and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions pursuant to the CMA.  National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (NUFI) is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh and Chartis Specialty Insurance Company (CSI) is a member of the FHLB of Chicago. FHLB membership provides participants with access to various services, including access to low-cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage-backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets. These advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes. As of March 31, 2013, neither NUFI nor CSI had any advances outstanding under their respective FHLB facilities.  On April 29 2013, we entered into a new $625 million Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) letter of credit facility, which replaced the prior $725 million ACNL letter of credit facility. Under the new facility, AIG Parent replaced AIG Property Casualty Inc. as a direct obligor. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd's), is required to hold capital at Lloyd's, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account, the entire FAL requirement of $564 million, as of April 29, 2013, was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility.   124      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    AIG Life and Retirement     We believe that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries have liquidity sources adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, dispositions of invested assets. The AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries maintain liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $7.6 billion as of March 31, 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, AIG Life and Retirement provided $1.3 billion of liquidity to AIG Parent which was funded by the payment of dividends from AIG Life and Retirement's insurance subsidiaries.  The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a significant potential liquidity requirement for AIG Life and Retirement's insurance subsidiaries. We believe that because of the size and liquidity of our investment portfolios, AIG Life and Retirement does not face a significant liquidity risk due to normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience. As part of its risk management framework, AIG Life and Retirement continues to evaluate programs, including securities lending programs and other secured financings, to improve its liquidity position and facilitate AIG Life and Retirement's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.  During 2012, AIG Life and Retirement began utilizing programs that lend securities from its investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, the AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to highly liquid short-term investments. AIG Life and Retirement's liability to the borrower for collateral received was $4.1 billion as of March 31, 2013. In addition, certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. As of March 31, 2013, AIG Life and Retirement had outstanding borrowings of $50 million from the FHLBs. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other general corporate purposes.  In March 2011, AIG Parent entered into CMAs with certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary's projected company action level RBC. As a result, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries falls below the specified minimum percentage of their respective company action level RBC, AIG Parent will contribute cash or instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG Parent may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate.  In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBC, subject to approval by their respective boards, the subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of:  •(i) the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage, or •(ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law.  The CMAs do not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board and regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMAs would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As a result of a reduction in rating agency minimum requirements and greater capital efficiency arising from the consolidation of legal entities, the specified minimum percentage decreased from 435 percent to 385 percent effective February 19, 2013, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage remained at 250 percent.  In the first quarter of 2013, AIG Parent received a total of approximately $1.3 billion in distributions from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries funded by the payment of dividends from AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries, which were made under the CMAs. AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions to AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2013 under the CMAs.   125      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Other Operations        Mortgage Guaranty     We currently expect that our Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, dispositions of invested assets. Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $419 million as of March 31, 2013. Mortgage Guaranty businesses also maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, which could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations. These securities included substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds totaling $3.7 billion at March 31, 2013.     Global Capital Markets     GCM acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. It executes its derivative trades under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of GCM's transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties. Most of GCM's CDS are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of our credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. We estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDS using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions.  As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, GCM had total assets of $8.6 billion and $8.0 billion and total liabilities of $4.2 billion and $4.9 billion. GCM's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM's liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted included in GCM to third parties was $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. GCM obtained collateral from third parties totaling $751 million and $846 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.     Direct Investment Book     The DIB is managed so that it maintains the liquidity that we believe is necessary to meet all of the DIB liabilities as they come due, even under stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from AIG Parent. If the DIB's risk target is breached, we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB's liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.  The DIB's assets consist primarily of cash, short term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities and, to a lesser extent, bank loans and mortgage loans. The DIB's liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short — term financing obligations. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, the DIB had total assets of $26.4 billion and $28.5 billion and total liabilities of $22.7 billion and $23.8 billion.  The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and are not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.  Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $4.3 billion at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.   126                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Credit Facilities     We maintain a committed revolving four-year syndicated credit facility (the Four-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Four-Year Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit. We currently expect to replace or extend the Four-Year Facility on or prior to its expiration in October 2016, although no assurance can be given that the Four-Year Facility will be replaced on favorable terms or at all.  The Four-Year Facility, entered into on October 5, 2012, provides for $4.0 billion of unsecured revolving loans, which includes a $2.0 billion letter of credit sublimit. As of March 31, 2013, a total of approximately $3.0 billion remains available under the Four-Year Facility, of which approximately $1.0 billion remains available for letters of credit. Our ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Four-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Four-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.     Contingent Liquidity Facilities     AIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.  Our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.     Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                              Payments due by Period       March 31, 2013    (in millions)      Total Payments      Remainder of 2013      2014- 2015      2016- 2017      2018      Thereafter            Insurance operations                                          Loss reserves   $ 89,016   $ 23,005   $ 25,475   $ 13,152   $ 4,275   $ 23,109      Insurance and investment contract liabilities     232,785     12,469     26,084     24,854     11,314     158,064      Borrowings     1,603     8     47     9     3     1,536      Interest payments on borrowings     2,869     69     224     225     113     2,238      Other long-term obligations     34     7     14     8     5     –          Total   $ 326,307   $ 35,558   $ 51,844   $ 38,248   $ 15,710   $ 184,947          Other and discontinued operations                                          Borrowings(a)   $ 65,927   $ 5,349   $ 11,523   $ 15,808   $ 9,989   $ 23,258      Interest payments on borrowings     42,017     2,835     6,686     5,284     1,851     25,361      Aircraft purchase commitments     17,673     1,350     4,546     7,366     3,988     423      Other long-term obligations     210     30     90     2     –     88          Total   $ 125,827   $ 9,564   $ 22,845   $ 28,460   $ 15,828   $ 49,130          Consolidated                                          Loss reserves   $ 89,016   $ 23,005   $ 25,475   $ 13,152   $ 4,275   $ 23,109      Insurance and investment contract liabilities     232,785     12,469     26,084     24,854     11,314     158,064      Borrowings(a)     67,530     5,357     11,570     15,817     9,992     24,794      Interest payments on borrowings     44,886     2,904     6,910     5,509     1,964     27,599      Aircraft purchase commitments     17,673     1,350     4,546     7,366     3,988     423      Other long-term obligations(b)     244     37     104     10     5     88          Total(c)   $ 452,134   $ 45,122   $ 74,689   $ 66,708   $ 31,538   $ 234,077            (a) Includes $24.1 billion of borrowings related to ILFC.  (b) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.  (c) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.9 billion ($4.6 billion excluding Aircraft Leasing), the timing of which is uncertain.    127      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities       Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to AIG Life and Retirement businesses. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of our control.  We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We believe that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.  Loss reserves relate to the AIG Property Casualty and the Mortgage Guaranty businesses, and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that AIG Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.     Borrowings     Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG and its subsidiaries through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements.   128      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments     The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                              Amount of Commitment Expiring       March 31, 2013  (in millions)      Total Amounts Committed      Remainder of 2013      2014- 2015      2016- 2017      2018      Thereafter            Insurance operations                                          Guarantees:                                          Standby letters of credit   $ 832   $ 262   $ –   $ 565   $ –   $ 5      Guarantees of indebtedness     176     –     –     –     –     176      All other guarantees(a)     17     7     7     1     –     2      Commitments:                                          Investment commitments(b)     1,845     1,462     212     171     –     –      Commitments to extend credit     564     522     42     –     –     –      Letters of credit     10     3     7     –     –     –      Other commercial commitments(c)     699     –     –     –     –     699          Total(e)   $ 4,143   $ 2,256   $ 268   $ 737   $ –   $ 882          Other and discontinued operations                                          Guarantees:                                          Liquidity facilities(d)   $ 101   $ –   $ –   $ –   $ –   $ 101      Standby letters of credit     307     299     6     2     –     –      All other guarantees(a)     392     6     180     79     31     96      Commitments:                                          Investment commitments(b)     393     302     65     26     –     –      Commitments to extend credit     91     87     3     –     –     1      Letters of credit     21     21     –     –     –     –      Other commercial commitments(c)     7     5     2     –     –     –          Total(e)(f)   $ 1,312   $ 720   $ 256   $ 107   $ 31   $ 198          Consolidated                                          Guarantees:                                          Liquidity facilities(d)   $ 101   $ –   $ –   $ –   $ –   $ 101      Standby letters of credit     1,139     561     6     567     –     5      Guarantees of indebtedness     176     –     –     –     –     176      All other guarantees(a)     409     13     187     80     31     98      Commitments:                                          Investment commitments(b)     2,238     1,764     277     197     –     –      Commitments to extend credit     655     609     45     –     –     1      Letters of credit     31     24     7     –     –     –      Other commercial commitments(c)     706     5     2     –     –     699          Total(e)(f)   $ 5,455   $ 2,976   $ 524   $ 844   $ 31   $ 1,080            (a) Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and AIG Life and Retirement construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations.  (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.  (c) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2013 is expected to be approximately $63 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.  (e) Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (f) Includes $338 million attributable to ILFC, which is reported as discontinued operations.    129      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities     While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, our involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturity securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. We consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   Indemnification Agreements     We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements.

They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.  We are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers". Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or require accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.  In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions, or to permit termination of the transactions. Such transactions could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of AIGFP's counterparties would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.  The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depend on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity, Capital and Credit in the 2012 Annual Report.   Dividend Restrictions     Payment of future dividends to AIG shareholders depends in part on the regulatory framework that will ultimately be applicable to AIG, including AIG's status as a SLHC under Dodd-Frank and whether AIG is determined to be a non-bank SIFI. See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of potential restrictions on payments of dividends to common shareholders.  Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for additional discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG and its subsidiaries.   133                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS       Investments    OVERVIEW     Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement, and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.     Market Conditions     Our investments and investment strategies were affected by the following conditions in the first quarter of 2013:  •Central banks initiated actions intended to improve weakening economic conditions, including the European Central Bank's commitment to further bond purchases and the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to maintain the Federal Funds Rate in the zero to a quarter percent range. The Federal Reserve also committed to support the mortgage market via purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, and extended "Operation Twist", a program of redeeming short-term U.S. Treasury securities and using the proceeds to buy longer-term U.S. Treasury securities with the objective of putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  •Equity markets experienced positive returns and reached record highs in the first quarter of 2013.   •Bond yields remained low, although the 10-Year U.S. Treasury rate temporarily increased above 2 percent before retreating to 1.85 percent at the end of the quarter. Investment grade interest rates increased during the first quarter.  •The U.S. dollar strengthened by 3 percent, 7 percent and 9 percent against the euro, British pound, and Japanese yen, respectively.     Investment Strategies     At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   •In the case of AIG Life and Retirement, as well as in the DIB, our fundamental investment strategy is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable.  •Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of AIG Property Casualty, cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   •Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  •AIG Parent's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and tenor. During the first quarter of 2013, upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchased publicly traded, intermediate term, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.   134      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS     Investment Highlights     The following is an overview of investment activities during the first quarter of 2013:  •We continued to make risk-weighted opportunistic investments in RMBS and other structured securities to improve yields and increase net investment income.  •Blended investment yields on new AIG Life and Retirement and AIG Property Casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  •An increase in rates in investment grade asset classes more than offset a continued narrowing of spreads on below investment grade securities, resulting in net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio.  •Other-than-temporary-impairments continued their downward trend, with structured securities experiencing only minor impairments in the quarter.   Credit Ratings     At March 31, 2013, approximately 88 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 18 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.  A significant portion of our foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2013, approximately 15 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 4 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 47 percent of the foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us. For a further discussion of the NAIC designations of our fixed maturity securities, see NAIC Designations below.  See Enterprise Risk Management herein for a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments.   135      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  The following table presents the composite AIG

AIG Property Casualty     In our property casualty business, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines. As differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies, the focus is not on asset-liability matching, but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus.  Fixed maturity securities of AIG Property Casualty domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.3 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds . The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.   137      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  Fixed maturity securities held in AIG Property Casualty foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration, averaging 4.4 years.  While invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in AIG Property Casualty domestic operations, a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds. These investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long-term returns over time.   AIG Life and Retirement     With respect to AIG Life and Retirement, we use asset-liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets. Our objective is to maintain a matched asset-liability structure, although we may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position. To the extent that we have maintained a matched asset-liability structure, the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated.  Our investment strategy for AIG Life and Retirement is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities. There exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in-force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.  AIG Life and Retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a low interest rate environment.  The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity.  A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products. The fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. We manage our exposure resulting from these long-term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. We actively review underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees. We have taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees. We execute listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products. We also enter into various types of futures and options contracts, primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates. We use several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure, including listed futures on government securities, listed options on government securities and the purchase of government securities.  With respect to over-the-counter derivatives, we deal with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. We have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. We generally use ISDA Master Agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.  Fixed maturity securities of AIG Life and Retirement, with an average duration of 6.4 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as municipal and government bonds, commercial mortgage loans, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on our composite ratings.     NAIC Designations     The SVO of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called 'NAIC Designations.' In general, NAIC Designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC   138      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  Designations for certain mortgaged-backed, asset-backed and collateralized securities are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third party engaged by the NAIC.  The following table presents the NAIC Designations of the fixed maturity securities in AIG Life and Retirement's fixed maturity security portfolio based on fair value:                              At March 31, 2013 (in millions)      Rating Agency Designation      Other Fixed Maturity Securities      Mortgage Backed, Asset Backed and Collateralized      Total            Investment grade:                            1   Aaa/Aa/A   $ 50,919   $ 37,428   $ 88,347      2   Baa     64,081     1,678     65,759          Subtotal         115,000     39,106     154,106          Below investment grade:                            3   Ba     4,527     778     5,305      4   B     2,166     373     2,539      5   Caa and Lower     526     373     899      6   In or near default     162     616     778          Subtotal         7,381     2,140     9,521          Total*       $ 122,381   $ 41,246   $ 163,627           * Excludes $690 million of fixed maturity securities that are not held in legal entities within AIG Life and Retirement that require a statutory filing, therefore no NAIC rating is available for these securities.

(b) Impairments of investments in Real estate are recorded in Other income.    Other-Than-Temporary Impairments     To determine other-than-temporary impairments, we use fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three-months periods ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 related to:  •issuer-specific credit events;  •securities for which we have changed our intent from hold to sell;  •declines due to foreign exchange rates;  •adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities;  •securities that experienced severe market valuation declines; and •other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts.  There was no significant impact to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations from other-than-temporary impairment charges for any one single credit. Also, no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.01 percent and 0.10 percent of total equity at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $205 million and $218 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(d) The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC.  (e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.   For the three-month period ended March 31, 2013, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $1.1 billion primarily due to the increase in interest rates for investment grade fixed maturity securities, which more than offset the narrowing of credit spreads for high yield securities.

We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.                   OVERVIEW       At AIG, we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm's major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses.    For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management in the 2012 Annual Report.         Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)      •    Our ERM framework provides senior management with a consolidated view of our risk appetite and major risk positions.   •    In each of our business units, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the ERM framework while working with ERM to mitigate risks across the firm.  •    Risk management is an integral part of how we manage our core businesses.         Credit Risk Management        Overview       Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of counterparty's credit ratings. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.  Our credit risks are managed at the corporate level within ERM. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by seasoned credit officers in all the business units, whose primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of credit risk policies and procedures.  Responsibilities of the CCO and credit executives include:  •developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies;   •approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives;   150      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT   •managing the approval process for requests for credit limits, program limits and credit transactions above authorities or where concentrations of risk may exist or be incurred;  •aggregating globally all credit exposure data by counterparty, country, sector and industry and reporting risk concentrations regularly to and reviewing with senior management;  •administering regular portfolio credit reviews of investment, derivative and credit-incurring business units and recommending corrective actions where required;  •conducting credit research on countries, sectors and asset classes where risk concentrations may exist;   •developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process; and •approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies in all credit portfolios.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We identify our aggregate credit exposures to our underlying counterparty risks.     Largest Credit Concentrations     Our single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 25 percent of Total equity at March 31, 2013 compared to 25 percent at December 31, 2012. Exposure to the U.S. Government primarily includes credit exposure related to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and to direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) based upon their U.S. Government conservatorship. Based on our internal risk ratings, at March 31, 2013, our largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure, apart from ILFC leasing arrangements secured by aircraft with airlines having below investment grade ratings, was related to a non-financial corporate counterparty. That exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity, compared to 0.6 percent at December 31, 2012.     Government Credit Concentrations (non-U.S.)     Our total direct and guaranteed credit exposure to non-U.S. governments is $21.4 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to $22.9 billion in December 31, 2012. Our single largest concentration in this sector was to the government of Japan in the amount of $6.9 billion at March 31, 2013. Most of these securities were held in the investment portfolios of our Japanese insurance operations and are yen denominated.   151      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  The following table presents our aggregate credit exposures to non-U.S. governments and their agencies, dependent state-owned enterprises, financial institutions and local governments:                                       (in millions)      March 31, 2013      December 31, 2012            Japan       $ 6,948    $ 8,109      Canada         2,704      2,718      Germany         1,253      1,446      France         1,148      1,207      China         921      926      South Korea         707      693      Singapore         638      122      United Kingdom         610      816      Mexico         573      552      Australia         539      601      Other         5,320      5,732          Total       $ 21,361    $ 22,922              Financial Institution Concentrations     Our single largest industry credit exposure at March 31, 2013 was to the global financial institutions sector as a whole, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of March 31, 2013, credit exposure to this sector was $77.1 billion, or 77 percent, of Total equity compared to 87 percent at December 31, 2012.  At March 31, 2013:  •$72.1 billion, or 94 percent, of these global financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings.  •$5.0 billion, or 6 percent, were considered non-investment grade based on our internal ratings. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade-rated financial institutions was $2.1 billion.  •Our aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $33.7 billion.  •Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $13.3 billion, or 17 percent, of the total global financial institution credit exposure. •The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, and captive fronting risk management programs for these financial institutions.     European Concentrations       We actively monitor our European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the Euro-Zone periphery. We use various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine the need for mitigating actions. As a mitigating action, we typically decide not to renew maturing exposures or, when the opportunity presents itself, to sell or to tender securities. To date, we have not actively used credit default protection. We periodically evaluate the financial condition of issuers and adjust internal risk ratings as warranted.  The result of these continuing reviews has led us to believe that our combined credit risk exposures in the Euro-Zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers.   152      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  The following table presents our aggregate United Kingdom and European credit exposures (excluding ILFC) by major sector:                                                      March 31, 2013            (in millions)      Sovereign      Financial Institution      Non- Financial Corporates      Structured Products/ Other(a)      Total      December 31, 2012 Total            Euro-Zone countries:                                               France      $ 1,148       $ 2,426       $ 7,147       $ 169       $ 10,890    $ 10,533      Germany         1,253          3,665          3,706          174          8,798      9,248      Netherlands         254          4,228          2,197          1,480          8,159      8,333      Spain         166          655          2,367          1,032          4,220      4,067      Italy         87          333          1,964          222          2,606      2,848      Belgium         132          203          921          –          1,256      1,174      Ireland         –          91          880          –          971      1,018      Luxembourg         –          27          603          36          666      666      Austria         146          151          206          –          503      523      Finland         127          30          296          –          453      432      Other Euro-Zone         24          24          206          18          272      306          Total Euro-Zone         3,337          11,833          20,493          3,131          38,794      39,148          Remainder of Europe                                               United Kingdom         610          9,004          15,895          4,458          29,967      30,372      Switzerland         59          4,817          2,880          –          7,756      7,290      Sweden         127          2,835          545          –          3,507      3,643      Other remainder of Europe         1,034          1,069          2,353          1,079          5,535      5,612          Total remainder of Europe         1,830          17,725          21,673          5,537          46,765      46,917          Total       $ 5,167       $ 29,558       $ 42,166       $ 8,668       $ 85,559    $ 86,065            (a) Other represents mortgage guaranty insurance ($1.3 billion), primarily in Spain ($935 million) and Italy ($174 million).   Aggregate credit exposure to European governments totaled $5.2 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Many of the European governments' ratings have been downgraded by one or more of the major rating agencies, occurring mostly in countries in the Euro-Zone periphery where our government credit exposures (Spain, Italy and Portugal) totaled $256 million at March 31, 2013. The downgrades primarily reflect continued recessionary conditions, large government budget deficits, rising government debt-to-GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these countries. These credit exposures primarily included available-for-sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. At March 31, 2013, we had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece, Ireland or Cyprus.  Our exposure to European financial institutions at March 31, 2013 included $18.7 billion of credit exposures to European banks, of which $17.3 billion were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade rated credit exposures to European banks were $1.5 billion. Our credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $7.7 billion at March 31, 2013, of which $4.4 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the five countries of the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $989 million, of which $710 million were fixed maturity securities. These credit exposures were primarily to the largest banks in Spain and Italy. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $1.4 billion at March 31, 2013, of which $759 million were fixed maturity securities. Our credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.  In addition, our exposure at March 31, 2013 to European financial institutions included $10.8 billion of aggregate credit exposure to non-bank institutions, mostly insurers and reinsurers, with $8.3 billion, or 77 percent, of credit exposure representing reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. At March 31, 2013, $1.4 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non-banks was fixed maturity securities, of which 94 percent were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings.   153      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  Of the $20.5 billion of non-financial institution corporate exposure to Euro-Zone countries at March 31, 2013, 95 percent was to fixed maturity securities ($11.0 billion) and insurance-related products ($8.4 billion), with the majority of the insurance exposures being trade credit insurance ($3.3 billion), captive fronting programs ($3.1 billion), and surety bonds ($1.5 billion). Our exposure to France of $7.1 billion at March 31, 2013 represented the largest single non-financial corporate country exposure within the Euro-Zone, of which $2.7 billion were fixed maturity securities. Approximately two-thirds of the French exposures were to issuers in the utilities, oil and gas, and telecommunications industries. Euro-Zone periphery non-financial institution corporate exposures ($5.4 billion) at March 31, 2013 were heavily weighted towards large multinational corporations or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (22 percent), telecommunications (16 percent), and oil and gas (9 percent).  Of the $7.4 billion at March 31, 2013 of United Kingdom and European structured product exposures (largely consisting of residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities), United Kingdom structured products accounted for 73 percent, while the Netherlands and Germany comprised 20 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the Euro-Zone periphery accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 76 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at March 31, 2013 based on external rating agency ratings.  In addition, we had commercial real estate-related net equity investments in Europe totaling $490 million at March 31, 2013 and related unfunded commitments of $92 million.  The following table presents our aggregate United Kingdom and European credit exposures (excluding ILFC) by product type:                                            March 31, 2013            (in millions)      Fixed Maturity Securities(a)      Cash and Short-Term Investments(b)      Insurance Credit Exposures(c)      Reinsurance Recoverables      Other(d)      Total      December 31, 2012 Total            Euro-Zone countries:                                                      France      $ 4,847       $ 428       $ 3,833        $ 541       $ 1,241       $ 10,890    $ 10,533      Germany         4,405          328          1,946          2,029          89          8,797      9,248      Netherlands         5,702          70          1,792          570          27          8,161      8,333      Spain         1,837          130          2,229          22          2          4,220      4,067      Italy         1,569          2          966          61          10          2,608      2,848      Belgium         890          1          358          3          3          1,255      1,174      Ireland         725          48          197          –          –          970      1,018      Luxembourg         332          8          326          –          –          666      666      Austria         294          4          202          3          –          503      523      Finland         316          12          122          3          –          453      432      Other Euro-Zone         116          7          148          –          –          271      306          Total Euro-Zone         21,033          1,038          12,119          3,232          1,372          38,794      39,148          Remainder of Europe                                                      United Kingdom         15,979          1,334          8,606          2,336          1,711          29,966      30,372      Switzerland         3,150          367          1,077          3,162          –          7,756      7,290      Sweden         1,545          1,628          329          3          –          3,505      3,643      Other remainder of Europe         3,200          650          1,342          17          329          5,538      5,612          Total remainder of Europe         23,874          3,979          11,354          5,518          2,040          46,765      46,917          Total      $ 44,907        $ 5,017       $ 23,473       $ 8,750       $ 3,412        $ 85,559    $ 86,065            (a) Fixed maturity securities primarily includes available-for-sale and trading securities reported at fair value of $42.0 billion ($42.0 billion amortized cost), and $2.9 billion ($2.9 billion amortized cost), respectively.

(d) Other primarily consists of derivative transactions reported at fair value.    154                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  At March 31, 2013, approximately 87 percent of fixed maturity securities in the United Kingdom and European exposures were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings. European financial institution fixed maturity securities exposure was $10.1 billion, of which $1.1 billion were covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and that have full recourse to the issuing bank). During the first quarter of 2013, $4.4 billion of fixed maturity securities were issued by banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries. Our subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $871 million and $308 million, respectively, at March 31, 2013. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.     Other Credit Concentrations     We have a risk concentration in the U.S. municipal sector, primarily through the investment portfolios of our insurance companies. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of our domestic property and casualty insurance companies. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. We had $405 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of our insurance company portfolios at March 31, 2013, compared to $464 million at December 31, 2012. These exposures consisted of derivatives and trading securities (at fair value), and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.  We have a risk concentration in the residential mortgage sector in the form of non-agency RMBS, CDO of RMBS as well as our mortgage guaranty insurance business. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details on RMBS and CDO investments. The net risk-in-force for UGC was $34.7 billion at March 31, 2013, of which exposure in the United States was $31.5 billion. UGC has no concentration of exposure in any one state that exceeds 10 percent of UGC's total United States exposure.  We also have a risk concentration in the commercial real estate sector in the form of non-agency CMBS, CDO of CMBS as well as commercial mortgage whole loans. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments and Investments — Commercial Mortgage Loans herein for further details.  We also monitor our aggregate cross-border exposures by country and region. Cross-border exposure is defined as an underlying risk that is taken within a country or jurisdiction other than the country or jurisdiction in which an AIG business unit taking the risk is domiciled. These cross-border exposures include both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and cross-border investments in our own international subsidiaries. Five countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Based on our internal risk ratings, at March 31, 2013, three countries were rated AAA and two were rated AA. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and Bermuda.  We regularly review concentration reports in the categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. We periodically adjust limits and review exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that we do not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that our credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.     Market Risk Management     Market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity and commodity prices, and their levels of volatility. Market risk includes credit spread risk, the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in credit spreads of securities or counterparties.  We are exposed to market risks, primarily within our insurance businesses and GCM. In our insurance operations, market risk results primarily from potential mismatches in our asset-liability exposures, rather than speculative positioning. Specifically, our life insurance and retirement businesses collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long-term, fixed maturity securities. We earn a spread between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders. We manage the business so that the cash flows from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due, without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market. In periods of severe market volatility, depressed and illiquid fair values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders' equity even without actual credit event related losses.   155      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  Our market exposures can be categorized as follows:  •  Benchmark interest rates. Benchmark interest rates are also known as risk-free interest rates and are associated with either the government/treasury yield curve or the swap curve. The fair value of our significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change.  •  Credit spread or risk premium. Credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument.  •  Equity and alternative investment prices. We are exposed to equity and alternative investment prices affecting a variety of instruments. These include direct investments in common stock and mutual funds, minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and other equity-like investments, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, private equity investments, commercial real estate and real estate funds.  •  Foreign currency exchange rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies.     We use a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify our market risk exposure, including:   •  Duration/key rate duration. Duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed-income instrument to the changes in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve.  •  Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets.  •  Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.  •  VaR. Value at Risk (VaR) is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors, and a management-determined level of confidence, to estimate how frequently a portfolio of risk exposures could be expected to lose at least a specified amount.    Insurance Operations Portfolio Sensitivities     The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                                              Exposure          Effect     (dollars in millions)      March 31, 2013      December 31, 2012      Sensitivity Factor      March 31, 2013      December 31, 2012            Yield sensitive assets      $ 301,502    $ 305,809   100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves       $ (16,504  )  $ (16,005 )    Equity and alternative                20% decline in stock prices and value                   investments exposure       $ 26,929    $ 27,131    of alternative investments      $ (5,386  )  $ (5,426 )    Foreign currency exchange                10% depreciation of all foreign currency                   rates net exposure       $ 9,757    $ 9,106    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar      $ (976  )  $ (911 )           Exposures to yield curve movements include fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short-term investments, but exclude consolidated separate account assets. Total yield-sensitive assets decreased 1.4 percent or   156      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  approximately $4.3 billion, compared to December 31, 2012, primarily due to a net decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of $2.7 billion, and a decrease in cash equivalents of $1.6 billion.  Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stock, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds, but exclude consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds. Total exposure in these areas decreased 0.7 percent, or approximately $202 million, compared to December 31, 2012, primarily due to a decrease of $80 million related to decreases in partnership investments, a decrease in common equity securities of $70 million and a decrease in other equity investments of $65 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in real estate investments of $11 million.  Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect our consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis. Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 7.1 percent, or $651 million, compared to December 31, 2012. This was primarily due to an increase in Hong Kong dollar exposure of $562 million as a result of AIG Life and Retirement's investment in PICC, and an increase in Hong Kong dollar exposure of $143 million due to the increase in market value of AIG Property Casualty's investment in PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. This should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.     Liquidity Risk Management     Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations.  The failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, and reputational harm. Because liquidity is critically important, our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address both AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.  Sources of Liquidity risk can include, but are not limited to:  •financial market movements — significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies. Changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions, inadequate market depth, or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets;  •potential reputational events or credit downgrade — changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements; and  •catastrophic events, including natural and man-made disasters, that can increase policyholder claims.  The principal objective of ERM's liquidity risk framework is to protect AIG's liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods.   We defined our risk appetite to include a liquidity target. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a two-year time horizon designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine the appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.  Additionally, each business unit is responsible for managing liquidity within a framework designed for the measurement and monitoring of liquidity risks inherent to the business. Current cash and liquidity positions are reviewed for changes and against minimum liquidity levels. Future cash inflows and outflows are tracked through cash flow forecasting. If the business unit projects a breach of the minimum liquidity levels, the amount of required liquidity resources will be identified and we will determine any actions to be taken. Business unit level key indicators are assessed to provide advance warning of potential liquidity risks.   157                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES      Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.      The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:   •classification of ILFC as held for sale;  •insurance liabilities, including property casualty and mortgage guaranty unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;  •income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;  •recoverability of assets including reinsurance assets;  •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;  •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments of financial instruments and goodwill impairments;  •liabilities for legal contingencies; and  •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.   See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. The following discussion updates critical accounting estimates included in the 2012 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, you should read this section in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2012 Annual Report.     Classification of ILFC as Held for Sale     We report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months, which may require significant judgment, and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized.  On December 9, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement with Jumbo Acquisition Limited for the sale of 80.1 percent of the common stock of ILFC for approximately $4.23 billion in cash. Jumbo Acquisition Limited may elect to purchase an additional 9.9 percent of the common stock of ILFC for $522.5 million (the Option) within ten days after approval of the ILFC Transaction and the Option by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The transaction is subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We determined ILFC met the criteria at December 31, 2012 for held for sale accounting and, consequently, we recorded a $4.4 billion after tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was reported in Income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2012.   158      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES     Recoverability of Net Deferred Tax Asset     The evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.  We consider a number of factors in order to reliably estimate future taxable income, so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses (NOLs), foreign tax credits (FTCs) and nonlife capital loss carryforwards. These factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG-specific conditions and events. We also subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. We also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies and stress scenarios, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes (other than life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards) prior to their expiration.  See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax asset.     Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities     See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and AIG's accounting policy regarding the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.  The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                         March 31, 2013 (in billions)      Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 279     94 %    Fair value based on internal sources     19     6          Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 298     100 %            (a) Includes $25 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.    Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  The following table presents the amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3:                                                (in billions)      March 31, 2013     Percentage of Total      December 31, 2012      Percentage of Total            Assets      $ 42.5          7.7     % $ 40.5     7.4 %    Liabilities         3.7          0.8      4.1     0.9           Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. We consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are   159      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.  We classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.  The following paragraphs describe the methods we use to measure fair value on a recurring basis for super senior credit default swaps classified in Level 3. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for other assets classified in Level 3, including certain fixed maturity securities and certain other invested assets, and Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein for a discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.     Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio     The entities included in GCM wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages through 2006. In these transactions, AIG is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets.  See Notes 5 and 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Regulatory Capital, Multi-Sector CDO, Corporate Debt/Collateralized Debt Obligation (CLO) and other portfolios.  AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on our calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio. For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Of the total $3.7 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at March 31, 2013, a BET value is available for $2.5 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.2 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $2.5 billion.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at March 31, 2013 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                               Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability            Average Inputs Used at March 31, 2013           (dollars in millions)      Change      Entire Portfolio      RMBS Prime      RMBS Alt-A      RMBS Subprime      CMBS      CDOs      Other            Bond prices   44 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (135 ) $ (2 ) $ (7 ) $ (64 ) $ (41 ) $ (11 ) $ (10 )           Decrease of 5 points     138     2     7     57     42     15     15          Weighted       Increase of 1 year     12     –     –     8     3     –     1      average life   5.93 years   Decrease of 1 year     (18 )   –     –     (14 )   (3 )   –     (1 )          Recovery rates   18%   Increase of 10%     (10 )   –     (2 )   (7 )   (1 )   –     –             Decrease of 10%     15     –     2     8     2     3     –          Diversity score(a)   13   Increase of 5     (5 )                                               Decrease of 5     11                                              Discount curve(b)   N/A   Increase of 100bps     5                                                (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.  In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, AIG's regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business — Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation, Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulation and Supervision and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report.     Other Regulatory Developments     In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly SIFIs, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). IAIS's ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries' financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority.  The FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). Ultimately, the IAIS will recommend its final assessment template to the FSB to determine whether any insurer groups should be designated as Globally Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs). The current timetable indicates preliminary designations to be announced by June 2013. AIG could be preliminarily designated a G-SII and, if a final designation is made, AIG could be then be subject to enhanced supervisory efforts, which could include enhanced capital requirements. Under the current timetable, insurer groups would expect to be definitively designated G-SIIs in 2017 and would then be subject to such enhanced capital requirements (currently termed High Loss Absorbance Capital requirements) in 2019.  The IAIS is developing a ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. As currently delineated under the ComFrame, AIG meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. While we currently do not know when any ComFrame directives will be finalized and become effective, the IAIS will undertake a field testing of the ComFrame, including the possibility of additional capital requirements for IAIGs, which is expected to commence in the latter part of 2013. It is expected that the ComFrame would be fully implemented by 2018.  Legislation in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective in January 2016 reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The impact on us will   161      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we, along with other insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.  We expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.   162                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / GLOSSARY        GLOSSARY Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.

ITEM 4. / CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013.  There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.   167                Table of Contents       PART II — OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1 / LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
