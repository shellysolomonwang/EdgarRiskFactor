Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of AIG for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 (AIG's First Quarter Form 10-Q), throughout Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial   95      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Condition and Results of Operations and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of AIG for the year ended December 31, 2010 (AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K).     AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.       Use of Non-GAAP Measures    Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of ongoing operations as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations.   AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis, Inc. (Chartis) using underwriting profit (loss). Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization and goodwill impairment charges, is utilized to report results for SunAmerica operations. Management believes that these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.       Executive Overview    This executive overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of AIG's financial statements. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety, together with AIG's First Quarter Form 10-Q and AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  AIG reports the results of its operations through the following reportable segments:    •Chartis — AIG's property and casualty operations are conducted through multiple-line companies writing substantially all commercial and consumer lines both domestically and abroad. Chartis offers its products through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes agents, wholesalers, global and local brokers, and direct-to-consumer platforms. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, reporting includes the results of Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji), which writes primarily consumer lines in Japan.   •SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) — SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, accident and health (A&H), fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms.   •Financial Services — AIG's financial services businesses engage primarily in commercial aircraft leasing through International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and in the management of the remaining Capital Markets derivatives portfolio through AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP).   96      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries          Highlights       Restructuring Activities    AIG substantially completed its recapitalization plan (the Recapitalization) and its asset disposition plan with the following significant milestones in 2011:    •On January 14, 2011 (the Closing), AIG completed the Recapitalization, which included:      •repaying the $20.7 billion outstanding balance and terminating the credit facility provided by the FRBNY (such credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility). As a result of the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility, AIG recorded a net $3.3 billion pre-tax charge for a loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2011, primarily representing the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset;   •applying proceeds from the AIA Group Limited (AIA) initial public offering and the American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) sale to partially repay the U.S. government's ownership interests (the SPV Preferred Interests) in special purpose vehicles that held AIA and ALICO (the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV, respectively, and collectively, the SPVs). As part of the Recapitalization, AIG used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to repay a portion of the liquidation preference and accrued return of the SPV Preferred Interests. The SPV Preferred Interests were further reduced during the first quarter of 2011 by approximately $9.1 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star), AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) and the sale of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities received in the sale of ALICO, in each case, discussed below; and   •exchanging preferred stock held by the Department of the Treasury and the AIG Credit Facility Trust (the Trust) for AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock).     •On January 12, 2011, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent interest in Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan) to a Taiwan-based consortium for $2.16 billion in cash. All regulatory approvals for the sale have been received and the transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2011. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   •On January 31, 2011, ILFC entered into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility. On March 30, 2011, ILFC entered into a secured $1.3 billion term loan with the right to add an additional $200 million of lender commitments. On April 21, 2011, ILFC increased its secured $1.3 billion term loan for a total commitment of $1.5 billion. On May 24, 2011, ILFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent senior notes due in 2016 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.25 percent senior notes due in 2019. On June 17, 2011, ILFC completed tender offers for the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with maturity dates in 2012 and 2013 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded losses of $61 million on the extinguishment of debt.   •On February 1, 2011, AIG completed the sale of its Japan-based life insurance subsidiaries, AIG Star and AIG Edison, to Prudential Financial, Inc., for $4.8 billion, consisting of $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in the assumption of third-party debt.   •On March 8, 2011, AIG completed the disposition of MetLife securities received upon the sale of ALICO to MetLife and used $6.6 billion of the proceeds to repay all of the liquidation preference and accrued return of the Department of the Treasury's ALICO SPV Preferred Interests and a portion of the liquidation preference and accrued return of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.   97      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Financial Overview    AIG's income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $305 million to $1.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 reflecting the following:    •fair value gains of $1.5 billion on the AIA ordinary shares, partially offset by the effect of the deconsolidation of AIA during the fourth quarter of 2010;   •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •a reduction in unallocated corporate expenses, principally due to the effect of securities litigation related charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010;   •lower levels of other-than-temporary impairment charges;   •an increased underwriting loss for Chartis reflecting higher catastrophe losses; and   •a reduction in the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests driven by widening spreads.    In the first six months of 2011, income from continuing operations before income taxes declined by $2.7 billion compared to the same period in 2010 and reflected a $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the first quarter of 2011, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011 and lower fair value gains on the Maiden Lane Interests, partially offset by higher fair value gains on the AIA ordinary shares.   In the first six months of 2011, AIG recorded income from discontinued operations net of taxes of $1.6 billion, which included a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2011 on the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison compared to a net loss of $2.3 billion in the same period in 2010, which included an impairment charge of $3.3 billion associated with the sale of ALICO.   See Results of Operations — Consolidated Results and Segment Results for further discussion.       Other Developments    On June 17, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' U.S. asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. At the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis ceded the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into the Chartis results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims.   On May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. A portion of the net proceeds AIG received from this offering, $550 million, is available to fund a litigation settlement, and AIG intends to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.   See Capital Resources and Liquidity herein and Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.  98      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Outlook       Priorities for 2011 and Beyond    AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2011 and beyond:    •continuing to strengthen and grow AIG's businesses;   •implementing plans to maximize the value of resources available for repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury;   •continuing to build, strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources;   •restructuring AIG's operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness;   •managing its capital more efficiently;   •investing its available cash in order to increase its net investment income; and   •continuing to work towards achieving the long-term aspirational goals with respect to return on equity and earnings per share as discussed in AIG's First Quarter Form 10-Q.        Chartis    Given current property and casualty industry capital levels and overall economic conditions, 2011 is anticipated to be a challenging year as Chartis expects a weak growth environment in most developed economies. The weakness of ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls, and sales) in 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base, as well as continued weakness in commercial insurance rates, were initially expected to continue through 2011. However, in the first six months of 2011, Chartis has observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the United States is beginning to abate. In addition, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 Chartis U.S. has observed a modest overall increase in its rates for the first time since 2009. In certain growth economies such as Brazil, Turkey, India, and Asia Pacific countries, Chartis expects improved growth rates.   In 2011, Chartis continues to execute on its strategy of growing its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business and implementing corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management continues to review its underlying businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures while seeking to reduce the overall volatility of results. In connection with these ongoing reviews, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, management took certain remedial actions relating to certain Consumer line programs that did not meet internal performance or operating targets, including the decision to reduce its net premiums written for two specific programs. Notwithstanding these actions, Chartis U.S. expects to continue to grow its Consumer lines business and, excluding these specific actions, the overall Consumer business continues to see growth in line with management's expectations.   To the extent that the aforementioned weakness in ratable exposures continue to abate, Chartis U.S. expects moderate growth in both gross and net written premiums in 2011. Chartis U.S. expects continued growth within its Consumer lines business and an overall decline in certain classes of its Commercial lines business. Because the Consumer lines business generally carries higher origination costs than Commercial lines business, Chartis U.S. expects an overall increase in its expense ratio due to the change in the mix of business. However, this increase is expected to be largely offset by on-going expense saving initiatives that were introduced in 2010.   Chartis International expects continued growth in net written premiums in 2011 as a result of its well established franchises and operations, expectations for continued globalization, increased demand for liability insurance, and growth in the gross domestic product within countries included in the Growth Economies region. Growth is also expected in the Far East region due in large part to the full-year inclusion of the Fuji results, compared to only six months of results in 2010. Further, in connection with its acquisition of a controlling interest in Fuji in 2010, Chartis recognized certain net intangible liabilities related to the difference between the fair value  99      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  and the carrying value of the insurance contracts acquired. The amortization of these liabilities will have a beneficial impact on the expense ratio through the third quarter of 2011. Strong pricing discipline in a continued soft market is expected to keep the Europe region net written premiums at levels consistent with 2010.   On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake occurred near the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan, triggering a tsunami in the Pacific Ocean. This disaster is referred to as the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami (the Tohoku Catastrophe).  The following table summarizes Chartis charges related to the Tohoku Catastrophe:                        (in millions)   Three Months Ended March 31, 2011   Six Months Ended June 30, 2011            Claims and claims adjustment expenses   $ 1,298   $ 1,284      Reinsurance reinstatement premiums     39     53            Total   $ 1,337   $ 1,337              The claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred include Chartis' participation in the Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance Company (JERC). The JERC is a joint government-private sector insurance system that is the exclusive provider of earthquake coverage for personal dwellings and their contents in Japan. Under the JERC system, a maximum of 5.5 trillion Yen ($67 billion at the June 30, 2011 weighted average exchange rate) of industry-wide losses will be covered by the Japanese government, the JERC, and private, general insurance companies in Japan through five layers of liability. Fuji is a 6.2 percent shareholder of the JERC. As such, Fuji, in accordance with Japanese statutory accounting rules, as well as the requirements of private sector participants in the JERC, had previously established reserves for potential claims associated with earthquake damage to personal dwellings. These reserves, which are backed by funds held by the JERC, exist to cover the potential losses that Fuji could sustain in connection with JERC-related claims. Given these statutory reserves, and its current estimate of losses, Chartis expects minimal net effects on the statutory capital and liquidity of its Japanese operations.   The Tohoku Catastrophe caused significant damage to Japan's transportation, power, manufacturing and service sectors and resulted in disruptions to supply chains, particularly in the technology and automobile industries. These disruptions have resulted in contingent business interruption (CBI) claims from insureds.   Generally, CBI coverage reimburses insureds for loss of business income or extra expense as a result of physical damage sustained by a supplier. The insured's supplier must have sustained physical damage by a peril otherwise covered by the insured's property policy and subject to its respective policy terms and conditions. Potential CBI losses are difficult to initially ascertain due to the unique facts and circumstances of each insured's supply chain and the specific conditions of its CBI coverage.   Chartis believes that the estimated loss liabilities for this catastrophe, including reserves established for CBI claims and JERC-related losses, are reasonable. Chartis has concluded that as of June 30, 2011 there was no overall net change to its March 31, 2011 estimate of total net losses, inclusive of reinstatement premiums, relating to the Tohoku Catastrophe. However, given the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe and the inherent nature of the underlying claims, the subsequent development of these liabilities in future periods could vary materially from amounts included in the accompanying June 30, 2011 financial statements.   As part of Chartis' ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk, on June 17, 2011, but with retroactive effect to January 1, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' U.S. asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. The transaction with NICO covers potentially volatile U.S.-related asbestos exposures. The transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that Chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by Chartis subsidiaries. The transfer was effected under a reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net asbestos liabilities. In connection with this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second  100      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into the Chartis results of operations as the underlying claims are settled.   Under GAAP, any future loss development on this retroactive reinsurance agreement will be reported in the period recognized through the results of operations. The corresponding recovery from NICO will be deferred, and consistent with the original deferred gain, amortized into the results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims.   Consistent with AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy, Chartis places primary emphasis on investments in fixed income securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies, and to a lesser extent, common stocks, real estate hedge funds and other alternative investments.   Fixed maturity securities held by Chartis U.S. historically have consisted primarily of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to better optimize its overall investment portfolio, including risk-return and tax objectives, Chartis U.S. has begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet overall liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   Chartis makes determinations of other-than-temporary impairments based on the fundamental credit analyses of individual securities. For the Chartis U.S. other invested asset classes, more specifically life settlements contracts, impairments are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis. During the second quarter of 2011, Chartis U.S. implemented an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individual's health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. Chartis U.S. also revised its valuation table, which it is using in estimating future net cash flows. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts. These changes resulted in an increase in the number of life settlement contracts identified as potentially impaired compared to previous analyses. As the overall book of business continues to mature and new medical information continues to become available regarding insureds, updated life expectancy assumptions may result in an increase in impairments relating to these assets. At June 30, 2011, Chartis U.S. held 5,819 life settlement contracts, included in Other invested assets, with a carrying value of $4.0 billion and a face value of $18.4 billion.   Chartis presents its financial information in the manner in which the business is currently being managed, with Chartis U.S. and Chartis International as the primary units included in the segment. On March 31, 2011, AIG announced a reorganization of its Chartis operations and named a new management team. Under the new structure, Chartis will consist of two major global groups — commercial and consumer — with the supporting claims, actuarial, and underwriting disciplines integrated into these two major business operations. In addition, Chartis will be organized geographically as four principal regions: the United States & Canada, Europe, the Far East and Growth Economies (primarily Asia Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America).   During the second quarter of 2011, the newly appointed executive management team made a number of key appointments to its overall management team and certain key decisions regarding how its underlying operating segments will be organized. However, management continues to work on the final key elements of the new organization and operating structure. As the new structure is finalized, the presentation of Chartis results will be modified accordingly and prior periods' presentations will be modified to conform to the new reporting presentation. Currently, Chartis anticipates that it will complete its organization and operating design and related segment reporting changes in the third quarter of 2011.       SunAmerica    SunAmerica intends in 2011 to expand its distribution capabilities, reposition its excess cash and liquidity, maintain a strong statutory surplus, pro-actively manage expenses and, subject to regulatory approval, increase dividends paid to AIG Parent. SunAmerica made progress on all of these fronts during the first six months of 2011.  101      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  SunAmerica built up a large cash and short-term investment position with the intention of purchasing all the assets in the Maiden Lane II portfolio. With the FRBNY's decision to sell the MLII assets through a competitive sales process, SunAmerica began acquiring other fixed income investments, including certain securities from Maiden Lane II. However, beginning late in the first quarter of 2011, SunAmerica started investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer-term higher-yielding securities to improve spreads, while actively managing credit and liquidity risks. SunAmerica made substantial progress commencing in the latter part of the first quarter of 2011 reducing its cash and short-term investment position from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2010 to $4.6 billion at June 30, 2011.   After a period of historic lows, interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first three months of 2011 before declining in the three months ended June 30, 2011. Changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. Although interest rates declined in the second quarter of 2011, SunAmerica believes that its fixed annuity sales should continue to exceed 2010 sales levels.   During 2011, SunAmerica sold approximately $3.4 billion of investments in order to generate capital gains to partially preserve the recoverability of the deferred tax asset relating to capital losses. The reinvestment of the proceeds from these sales will ultimately create downward pressure on yields due to the current low interest rate environment.   SunAmerica has experienced an increase in its variable annuity sales as various distribution partners have resumed sales of SunAmerica's products during 2010 and 2011. SunAmerica's largest pre-financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner agreed to resume distribution of SunAmerica's products in mid-2011. As a result of broader distribution opportunities and improvement in the equity markets, SunAmerica expects continued improvement in its variable annuity sales.   In amortizing Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC), Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) and Sales Inducement Assets (SIA), SunAmerica uses a reversion to mean methodology to account for fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business. Favorable separate account returns in the second half of 2011 could trigger a favorable unlocking, where the reversion to mean assumption is reset in 2011 which could result in higher amortization expense in future periods. Such unlocking is not expected to be significant to SunAmerica's operating results.   AIG life insurance companies have received industry-wide regulatory inquiries with respect to claims settlement practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws. AIG life insurance companies are enhancing their claims practices to use information such as the Social Security Death Master File to determine when insureds have died, and thus increased their estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims by $100 million in the second quarter of 2011.   SunAmerica already had robust practices relating to insurance claims settlements and compliance with unclaimed property laws that are consistent with applicable legal requirements and historical industry standards.   SunAmerica focuses on identifying cost effective opportunities to manage certain redundant statutory reserve requirements on term insurance and universal life insurance with secondary guarantees (XXX and AXXX reserves) through intercompany reinsurance agreements. For this purpose, SunAmerica had a $585 million syndicated letter of credit facility and $215 million of letters of credit on a bilateral basis outstanding at June 30, 2011, all of which relate to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. All of these letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015.  102                Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Financial Services   ILFC   ILFC continues to execute on its strategy to manage its fleet of aircraft, and expects to continue selling and parting out certain aircraft throughout the year. Depending on market conditions and the specific aircraft that may be sold, ILFC may incur additional losses on sales or record impairment charges and fair value adjustments, although these charges are not currently expected to be at the level recognized in 2010. AIG is considering strategic alternatives for ILFC, which may include a potential sale, spinoff or initial public offering.   AIGFP   The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis, although the portfolio may experience periodic mark-to-market volatility.   Other Operations   Parent & Other Businesses   In 2011, AIG completed the Recapitalization, executed transactions in the debt and equity capital markets and substantially completed its asset disposition plan. It is expected that declines in interest expense and costs associated with disposition activity will be at least partially offset in the short term by increases in unallocated expenses, primarily attributable to corporate initiatives and efforts to continue improving internal controls and financial and operating technology platforms. In addition, Parent and Other operations may continue to experience periodic volatility due to fair value gains or losses on the AIA ordinary shares and the retained interest in ML III.   Mortgage Guaranty   United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) has continued to improve its new book of business through differentiated pricing and improved underwriting practices. In older books of business, primarily the 2005 to 2008 books, newly reported delinquencies continue to decline while increased claims severity and overturns on previously denied claims unfavorably impacted results. UGC continues to deny claims and rescind coverage on loans (collectively referred to as rescissions) related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms, mostly with respect to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business. These policy violations have resulted in loan rescissions totaling $402 million of claims on first-lien business during the first six months of 2011 compared to $230 million during the same period in 2010. Although rescissions will continue to affect UGC's financial results, they have declined as a percentage of claims due to a higher level of appeals and overturns resulting from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. While these items may increase volatility in the future, AIG believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans after consideration of rescissions and overturns, consistent with industry practice.   Foreclosure moratoriums as a result of state attorneys' general investigations into lenders' foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 have slowed the reporting of claims from foreclosures. As a result, UGC is incurring additional costs associated with the payment of older claims which has adversely affected claim severity. This trend may continue and may affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is uncertain and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution, individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition.   In March 2011, federal regulators (as required by the Dodd-Frank Act) issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a Qualified Residential Mortgage (QRM) whereby a maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80 percent would be required for a home purchase transaction. The LTV is calculated without imputing  103      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan. The final regulations could adversely impact UGC's volume of domestic first-lien new insurance written, depending on the final definition of a QRM, the maximum LTV allowed and the benefit, if any, prescribed to the presence of private mortgage insurance.   Direct Investment Book   Matched Investment Program (MIP) assets and liabilities and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP are currently managed on a collective program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent. Liquidity requirements across the two portfolios are satisfied by transferring cash between AIG Parent and AIGFP as needed. Program management is focused on reducing and managing liquidity requirements, including contingent liquidity requirements arising from collateral posting requirements, for both derivative and debt positions of the combined program. As part of this program management, AIG may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions.   During 2011, AIG expects to continue to exit non-strategic assets within the Global Real Estate investment portfolio. AIG carefully evaluates each investment in the portfolio with a view towards optimizing the value of higher quality assets by considering, among other things, the risk adjusted returns, overall investment risks and funding commitment. This strategy may extend the hold times for certain assets in the portfolio in order to maximize returns.   The remainder of this MD&A is organized as follows:                             Index   Page            Results of Operations     105        Consolidated Results     105        Segment Results     110          Chartis Operations     111            Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense     123          SunAmerica Operations     128          Financial Services Operations     133          Other Operations     135      Capital Resources and Liquidity     140      Investments     152        Investment Strategy     152        Other-Than-Temporary Impairments     163      Enterprise Risk Management     168      Critical Accounting Estimates     171               AIG has incorporated into this discussion a number of cross-references to additional information included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to assist readers seeking additional information related to a particular subject.  104                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Results of Operations       Consolidated Results       The following table presents AIG's condensed consolidated results of operations:                                           Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Change   Percentage Change     (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Revenues:                                            Premiums    $ 9,898    $ 11,073      (11 )%  $ 19,380    $ 21,987      (12 )%      Policy fees      682      657      4      1,366      1,305      5        Net investment income      4,464      5,041      (11 )    10,033      10,241      (2 )      Net realized capital gains (losses)      66      (487 )    -      (585 )    (821 )    29        Aircraft leasing revenue      1,134      1,180      (4 )    2,290      2,423      (5 )      Other income      432      850      (49 )    1,628      1,734      (6 )            Total revenues      16,676      18,314      (9 )    34,112      36,869      (7 )          Benefits, claims and expenses:                                            Policyholder benefits and claims incurred      8,086      8,743      (8 )    17,045      17,336      (2 )      Interest credited to policyholder account balances      1,110      1,127      (2 )    2,215      2,236      (1 )      Amortization of deferred acquisition costs      1,786      1,967      (9 )    3,502      3,989      (12 )      Other acquisition and insurance expenses      1,653      1,704      (3 )    3,204      3,314      (3 )      Interest expense      968      1,734      (44 )    2,029      3,485      (42 )      Aircraft leasing expenses      627      636      (1 )    1,297      1,640      (21 )      Loss on extinguishment of debt      79      -      -      3,392      -      -        Net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses and properties      2      (198 )    -      74      (122 )    -        Other expenses      559      1,100      (49 )    928      1,849      (50 )            Total benefits, claims and expenses      14,870      16,813      (12 )    33,686      33,727      -            Income from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit)      1,806      1,501      20      426      3,142      (86 )    Income tax expense (benefit)      (288 )    1,005      -      (488 )    558      -            Income from continuing operations      2,094      496      322      914      2,584      (65 )    Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense (benefit)      (37 )    (2,611 )    99      1,616      (2,268 )    -            Net income (loss)      2,057      (2,115 )    -      2,530      316      701            Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests      217      541      (60 )    421      1,189      (65 )          Net income (loss) attributable to AIG    $ 1,840    $ (2,656 )    - %  $ 2,109    $ (873 )    - %            Significant fluctuations in line items for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 are discussed below.       Premiums    Premiums decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 reflecting declines of $2.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, resulting from the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the effects of the deconsolidation of AIA, Premiums increased 15 percent and 13 percent, respectively, for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 due primarily to growth in Chartis premiums, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010. See Chartis results herein for further discussion.  105      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Policy Fees    Policy fees increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 primarily due to higher variable annuity fees on the separate account assets consistent with the growth in variable accounts assets as a result of positive equity market conditions in 2010 through the first six months of 2011.

Aircraft Leasing Revenue    Aircraft leasing revenue decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 due to a reduction in the size of ILFC's aircraft fleet under operating leases as a result of the sales of aircraft during 2010 and 2011 and the impact of lower lease rates on used aircraft. At June 30, 2011, ILFC had 933 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 946 at June 30, 2010.       Other Income    Other income includes unrealized gains and losses on derivatives including unrealized market valuation gains and losses associated with Capital Markets' super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio as well as income from Asset Management operations. The declines in Other income for three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 were driven by credit valuation adjustments on Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities and Direct Investment book assets and liabilities as well as lower levels of  107      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  impairment charges in Global Real Estate and the effects of the active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio.   For the first six months of 2011, Other income was also impacted by the effect of deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of AIG's third party asset management business in the first quarter of 2010. Additionally, the first six months of 2010 also reflected a bargain purchase gain of $332 million recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   See Segment Results — Financial Services Operations — Financial Services Results — Capital Markets Results and Critical Accounting Estimates — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred    The declines in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, reflected declines of $2.1 billion and $4.0 billion related to the deconsolidation of AIA. These declines were partially offset in the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 by the effect of Chartis' consolidation of Fuji and increased catastrophe losses, including the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter and the Tohoku Catastrophe in the first quarter of 2011.       Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs    The decline in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 primarily results from the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease was partially offset by increases for SunAmerica related to lower DAC amortization benefit from capital losses compared to 2010 due to significantly lower net realized capital losses in 2011.       Other Acquisition and Other Insurance Expenses    Policy acquisition and other insurance expenses decreased slightly in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 as a result of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010.       Interest Expense    Interest expense decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 primarily as a result of the repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Aircraft Leasing Expenses    Aircraft leasing expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to lower impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges recorded on aircraft. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $155 million on certain aircraft related primarily to sales and potential sales of aircraft compared to charges of $497 million in the same period in 2010.       Loss on Extinguishment of Debt    The loss on extinguishment of debt for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 includes:    •a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt resulting from ILFC's completion of tender offers to purchase notes on June 17, 2011;   108      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   •an $18 million loss from the extinguishment of debt associated with AIG's Equity Units during the second quarter of 2011; and   •a $3.3 billion charge for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.        Other Expenses    Other expenses include expenses associated with Capital Markets, Asset Management and AIG Parent. Other expenses decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 due to lower securities-related litigation charges and lower operating costs for the Institutional Asset Management business due to the effect of deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of AIG's third party asset management business.       Income Taxes        Interim Tax Calculation Method    In the first quarter of 2011, AIG began using the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provisions. The recent stabilization of operations and expected financial results allow AIG to estimate the annual effective tax rate to be applied to year-to-date income.   From the third quarter of 2008 through December 31, 2010, the discrete-period method was used to compute the interim tax provisions due to the significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre-tax accounting income, which were partly due to the effects of AIG's asset disposition program and restructuring.   The estimated annual effective tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 reflect a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset of the U.S. consolidated income tax group, and statutory rates were used for computing the tax expense of foreign subsidiaries.   Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to that item is treated discretely, and is reported in the same period as the related item. For the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, the tax effects of the loss on extinguishment of debt, other-than-temporary impairments, realized capital gains and losses, the sale of MetLife securities, and divestiture gains or losses were treated as discrete items.       Interim Tax Expense (Benefit)    For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, the effective tax rates on pretax income from continuing operations were (15.9) and (114.6) percent, respectively. The effective tax rates were negative because AIG recorded a tax benefit on pre-tax income. The tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance attributable to the anticipated inclusion of ALICO SPV within the U.S. consolidated income tax group, tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, investments in partnerships, and effective settlements of several uncertain tax positions.   For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, the effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations were 66.9 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the change in investment in subsidiaries and the increase in the valuation allowance, partially offset by the tax benefit associated with tax exempt interest. The effective tax rate for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting from changes in the expected taxable gain on subsidiaries to be sold, the tax benefit associated with tax exempt interest, and the bargain purchase gain  109      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  associated with the acquisition of Fuji, partially offset by the change in investment in subsidiaries which was principally related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of the subsidiaries.   See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.       Discontinued Operations        Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations consists of the following:                                    Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Foreign life insurance businesses    $ 612    $ (2,768 )  $ 1,154    $ (2,011 )    AGF      -      205      -      249      Net gain (loss) on sale      (692 )    (294 )    902      (401 )    Consolidation adjustments      -      (250 )    (1 )    (363 )    Interest allocation      -      (19 )    (2 )    (38 )          Income (loss) from discontinued operations    $ (80 )  $ (3,126 )  $ 2,053    $ (2,564 )    Income tax expense (benefit)      (43 )    (515 )    437      (296 )          Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax    $ (37 )  $ (2,611 )  $ 1,616    $ (2,268 )            Results from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2011 include a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion on the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison.   See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       Segment Results   AIG presents and discusses its financial information in a manner it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis, using underwriting profit (loss). AIG analyzes the operating performance of SunAmerica using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization and goodwill impairment charges. Results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses are excluded from these measures. AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses.

Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a metric of the sales period while net premiums earned are a metric of the coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is part of the unearned premium reserve.   Underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies for short duration contracts. The unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally recognized in earnings ratably over the policy period. Net premiums written for long duration contracts are earned when due from the policyholder. Net premiums written reflect the premiums retained after purchasing reinsurance protection.   AIG, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses, which consist of acquisition costs plus other insurance expenses, divided by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is a sum of loss ratio and expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expenses, and other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.   The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio.  112      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Chartis Net Premiums Written       The following table presents Chartis net premiums written by major line of business:                                           Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Change   Percentage Change     (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Consumer lines:                                            Accident & health    $ 1,493    $ 1,274      17 %  $ 3,016    $ 2,664      13 %      Personal lines      1,737      1,093      59      3,414      2,121      61        Life insurance      176      -      -      356      -      -            Total Consumer lines      3,406      2,367      44      6,786      4,785      42            Commercial lines:                                            Casualty      2,165      2,045      6      4,757      4,234      12        Property      1,223      1,134      8      2,140      1,998      7        Specialty      2,373      2,246      6      4,650      4,419      5            Total Commercial lines      5,761      5,425      6      11,547      10,651      8            Total net premiums written    $ 9,167    $ 7,792      18 %  $ 18,333    $ 15,436      19 %                  The following table presents the effect of the acquisition of Fuji on Chartis net premiums written:                           (in millions)   Three Months Ended June 30, 2011   Six Months Ended June 30, 2011            Chartis Net Premiums Written:                    Consumer lines, excluding Fuji   $ 2,521   $ 4,956        Commercial lines, excluding Fuji     5,716     11,453              Total net premiums written, excluding Fuji      8,237     16,409            Fuji Consumer lines     885     1,830      Fuji Commercial lines     45     94              Total Fuji net premiums written      930     1,924            Total Consumer lines     3,406     6,786      Total Commercial lines     5,761     11,547              Total net premiums written    $ 9,167   $ 18,333              Chartis' net premiums written increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 due to growth in both Consumer and Commercial lines of business. Growth in both lines is primarily related to the acquisition of Fuji. The acquisition of Fuji is a significant element of Chartis' overall strategy of changing its business mix to increase its overall Consumer writings and geographic diversity through the growth of Chartis International. In addition to the Fuji acquisition:    •Consumer lines increased for both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 as Chartis continues to execute its strategy of growing its higher margin, less capital intensive classes of business and as appropriate, taking corrective actions, including exiting certain classes of underperforming businesses; and   •Commercial lines increased primarily reflecting improvements in ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls and sales), general rate improvement and retrospective premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts for Chartis U.S.    Management continues to execute on its plan to reduce its exposure to certain classes of its Casualty lines of business. As an example, as of June 30, 2011 policies-in-force for Chartis U.S. specialty workers' compensation business decreased approximately 8 percent compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in Property net  113      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  premiums written reflects the effects of the 2010 three-year reinsurance agreement, secured through the issuance of catastrophe bonds, which provides protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes and reduced 2010 net written premiums by approximately $104 million.   The overall increase in Specialty lines for the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 is due to improved retention ratios, new business submissions and an improving rate environment. In addition, the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 increase includes one large errors and omission policy issued by Chartis U.S.   Overall, Chartis continues to see improved retention ratios and new business submissions that are consistent with management expectations. In particular, Chartis U.S. is also experiencing overall rate increases, more specifically as it relates to its Commercial Property and Workers' Compensation lines.       AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies.

In addition to the items above, for the six months ended June 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to an increase in losses on short tail lines of business.   Expense Ratio   For the three months ended June 30, 2011, the overall expense ratio remained essentially unchanged compared to the same period in 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the expense ratio shows modest improvements compared to the same period in 2010 due in large part to the net benefits of the amortization relating to the acquisition of Fuji. For the three- and six-month 2011 periods, Fuji reported expense ratios of 25.7 and 22.9, respectively.   Excluding Fuji, the overall expense ratio for the three- and six-month periods end June 30, 2011 are consistent with those of the comparable 2010 periods as increases in Chartis International were offset by decreases within Chartis U.S. The increase in Chartis International relates to costs that are consistent with management's strategic objectives, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, global accounting and claims system initiatives, Solvency II and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives.   Chartis Investing and Other Results   Net investment income for Chartis increased for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 due to the acquisition of Fuji, which contributed $50 million and $128 million, respectively, of net investment income in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011. Additionally, returns on mutual fund investments improved by $30 million and $76 million, respectively in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 as general market conditions continued to improve.  116      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Net realized capital gains declined in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 as increased gains from sales of municipal bonds were more than offset by other-than-temporary impairments on Other invested assets, notably life settlement contracts within Chartis U.S.   See Consolidated Results for further discussion on net investment income and net realized capital losses.

Loss-sensitive business relates to policies whose premiums vary with the level of underlying losses. Accordingly, for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, additional premiums of $91 million and $128 million were recorded because a comparable amount of additional prior year losses were   117      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   recognized. Conversely, the comparable 2010 three- and six-month periods included additional premiums of $1 million and returned premiums of $58 million, respectively, because incurred loss experience emerged more favorably; and    •an increase in Property net premiums written reflecting the effects of a three-year reinsurance agreement, secured through the issuance of catastrophe bonds, which provides protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes and reduced net written premiums in 2010 by approximately $104 million.    The overall increase in Specialty lines for the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 is due to improved retention ratios, new business submissions and an improving rate environment. In addition, the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 increase includes one large errors and omission policy issued by Chartis U.S.   Growing the higher margin Consumer lines of business continues to be a key Chartis U.S. strategy. Where Consumer line programs do not meet internal performance or operating targets, management takes appropriate remedial actions, including in the first quarter of 2011, the decision to de-emphasize two specific programs, resulting in a decline in Consumer lines net premiums written for the three- and six-month 2011 periods. Excluding the effects of these de-emphasized programs, the Chartis U.S. Consumer lines business continues to see growth in line with management's expectations.

Also, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, Chartis U.S. recorded net adverse prior year development of $3 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $91 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts and including reserve discount charges of $5 million). During the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, Chartis U.S. recorded net adverse prior year loss development of $89 million (net of returned premium adjustments of $1 million relating to loss sensitive insurance contracts), primarily relating to property lines of business.  118                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   For the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to an increase to the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Chartis U.S. Specialty Workers' Compensation and Excess Casualty business as a result of the current year loss ratios established in connection with its 2010 annual loss reserve study. These increases were partially offset by mix of business changes to lower loss ratio businesses within certain classes of Commercial and Consumer product lines.       Year-to-Date Loss Ratio   The increase in the loss ratio reflects the effects of increased catastrophe losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 as discussed above. Also, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, Chartis U.S. recorded net adverse prior year development of $76 million (net of additional premium adjustments of $128 million relating to loss-sensitive insurance contracts and including reserve discount charges of $30 million). During the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, Chartis U.S. recorded net favorable prior year loss development of $42 million (net of returned premium adjustments of $58 million relating to loss sensitive insurance contracts), primarily relating to property lines of business.   For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, the overall adjusted loss ratio increased primarily due to an increase to the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Chartis U.S. Specialty Workers' Compensation and Excess Casualty business as a result of the current year loss ratios established in connection with its 2010 annual loss reserve study and an increase in losses on short tail lines of business (primarily within its property lines). These increases were partially offset by the initial effects of mix of business changes to lower loss ratio businesses within certain classes of Commercial and Consumer product lines.       Expense Ratio   The overall decline in the expense ratio in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 is due to an increase in net premiums earned and a decrease in acquisition costs. The decrease in acquisition costs is due to strategic reductions in certain direct marketing activities and other commission reductions due to declines in writings of certain classes of Consumer lines business which generally carry higher origination costs. The increased net premiums earned are consistent with the net premiums written increase discussed above.   In addition to the three-month items mentioned above, the decline in the expense ratio in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 is due to a 2011 reduction in certain insurance and reinsurance credit risk related allowances based on ongoing improvements relating to the analysis of certain account balances and related credit and financial statement exposure. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, Chartis U.S. reduced its bad debt allowance by approximately $33 million compared to an increase of $30 million in the same period in 2010. Partially offsetting these declines are increased personnel costs relating to Chartis U.S.' strategy to continue to attract, retain and develop its human capital and to better align employee performance incentive programs with profitability, capital management, risk management, and other AIG performance measures.   Chartis U.S. Investing Results   For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2011 net investment income decreased due a decline in partnership returns. Additionally, the 2010 three- and six-month periods include interest received on a tax refund. These decreases were partially offset by improved returns on fixed maturity securities as Chartis U.S. continues to optimize its overall portfolio and has begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet overall liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   Net realized capital gains increased for both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the 2010 three- and six-month periods. In connection with its strategy to better improve its risk-return and tax objectives, Chartis U.S. recognized approximately $325 million in realized gains relating to the sale of municipal  119      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  bonds. These gains were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments recognized within other invested asset classes, primarily life settlement contracts for which $185 million and $254 million of impairments were recorded by Chartis U.S. for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively, including approximately $18 million and $19 million of impairments, respectively, associated with life insurance policies issued by SunAmerica life insurance companies that are eliminated at the AIG consolidated level.   At June 30, 2011, Chartis U.S. held 5,819 life settlement contracts, with a carrying value of $4.0 billion and face value of $18.4 billion, of which 157 contracts with a carrying value of $171 million and face value of approximately $508 million relate to life insurance policies issued by SunAmerica life insurance companies. Impairments of life settlement contracts are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis and a contract is identified as potentially impaired if its undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the current carrying value of such contract. Potentially impaired contracts are impaired, and written down to fair value, when the carrying value of the contract is greater than the estimated fair value.   During the second quarter of 2011, Chartis U.S. received updated medical information as a result of a recently enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individual's health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. Chartis U.S. also revised its valuation table, which it is using in estimating future net cash flows. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts. These changes resulted in an increase in the number of contracts identified as potentially impaired as compared to previous analyses. Further, Chartis U.S. refined its fair values based upon the availability of recent medical information.

In addition, Chartis International's Life insurance business included in Consumer lines is produced by Fuji; and   •continued stabilization of developed economies, which resulted in improved pricing, increased new business submissions and improved policyholder retention rates in both Consumer and Commercial lines.    The decline in net premiums written for Commercial Property in the three months ended June 30, 2011 is due in large part to reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to the Tohoku Catastrophe.   From a regional perspective, growth in the Far East region was driven primarily by the Fuji acquisition. The Growth Economy countries, with well established franchises and operations, continue to increase insurance penetration and growth within Consumer and Commercial lines. The Europe region's net premiums written levels modestly declined compared to 2010 due to continued strong pricing discipline in a recovering soft market, in particular as it relates to its Primary and Excess Casualty lines of business.  AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Chartis International net premiums written:                            Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,          2011 vs. 2010   2011 vs. 2010            Increase in original currency(a)(b)     27.7 %   27.9 %    Foreign exchange effect     10.2     5.9            Increase as reported in U.S. dollars     37.9 %   33.8 %            (a) Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.

Expense Ratio   The decline in the expense ratios in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 is due to the acquisition of Fuji. These ratios reflect the benefits from the amortization of net intangible liabilities relating to the Fuji acquisition. Excluding Fuji, the expense ratio increased 3.1 and 2.0 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010, respectively. This increase relates to costs that are consistent with management's strategic objectives, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, global accounting and claims systems initiatives and Solvency II readiness. Additionally, Chartis International incurred approximately $14 million of expenses relating to the implementation of its business continuity plans and charges related to damages resulting from the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011.  122      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Chartis International Investing and Other Results   Chartis International net investment income increased primarily related to Fuji's investment income, which is consolidated in Chartis International beginning on July 1, 2010, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.   Chartis International recorded net realized capital losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 compared to net realized capital gains in the same periods of 2010. The three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 included $66 million and $230 million, respectively, of gains relating to fixed maturity securities.   The bargain purchase gain of $332 million in 2010 was recognized in connection with the acquisition of Fuji.       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense    The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for the Chartis U.S. and Chartis International reporting units in the Chartis operating segment and loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit which is reported in AIG's Other operations category.

AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.   The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment income.  123      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit:                         (in millions)   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Chartis:                    Chartis U.S.    $ 53,570    $ 53,111        Chartis International      16,985      14,963            Total Chartis      70,555      68,074            Mortgage Guaranty      3,012      3,433            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 73,567    $ 71,507              Discounting of Reserves   At June 30, 2011, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.18 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 - 81 Decennial Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Those asbestos liabilities that are fixed and determinable are discounted based on investment yields. The discount is comprised of the following: $790 million — tabular discount for workers' compensation in Chartis U.S. and $2.27 billion — non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in Chartis U.S.; and $120 million — non-tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.   Quarterly Reserving Process   AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of June 30, 2011. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of June 30, 2011. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  The following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves:                                   Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 73,474    $ 68,549    $ 71,507    $ 67,899      Foreign exchange effect      165      (662 )    711      (1,215 )    Acquisitions*      -      -      -      1,538      Dispositions      -      (59 )    -      (84 )          Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                Current year      6,519      5,539      14,203      11,537        Prior years, other than accretion of discount      108      (137 )    92      (613 )      Prior years, accretion of discount      89      86      204      172            Losses and loss expenses incurred      6,716      5,488      14,499      11,096            Losses and loss expenses paid      6,788      5,893      13,150      11,809            Reclassified to liabilities held for sale      -      -      -      (2 )          Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 73,567    $ 67,423    $ 73,567    $ 67,423               * Represents the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.  124      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    The following tables summarize development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years (other than accretion of discount):                                   Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Prior Accident Year Development by Reporting Unit:                              Chartis:                                Chartis U.S.    $ 89    $ 90    $ 173    $ (100 )      Chartis International      (6 )    5      (65 )    (49 )          Total Chartis      83      95      108      (149 )    Mortgage Guaranty      25      (232 )    (16 )    (464 )          Prior years, other than accretion of discount    $ 108    $ (137 )  $ 92    $ (613 )                                          Calendar Year      Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)       2011   2010            Prior Accident Year Development by Accident Year:                  Accident Year                    2010    $ (15 )            2009      31    $ (206 )      2008      (24 )    (360 )      2007      72      (163 )      2006      (161 )    (36 )      2005      (74 )    13        2004 and prior      263      139            Prior years, other than accretion of discount    $ 92    $ (613 )            Offsetting the unfavorable development were related additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $128 million in 2011; returned premiums of $58 million offset the favorable development in 2010.   In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business, as appropriate, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for that period. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to the U.S. mortgage and housing market.   See Chartis Results herein for further discussion of net loss development.   Asbestos and Environmental Reserves   The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  125                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   As described more fully in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount and a minor adjustment to the environmental gross and net reserves are reflected in the table below.   On June 17, 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., under which the majority of Chartis' U.S. asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO as part of Chartis' ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk. The transaction with NICO covers potentially volatile U.S.-related asbestos exposures. The transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that Chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by Chartis subsidiaries.   Upon the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, Chartis ceded the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, Chartis recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into income over the settlement period of the underlying claims. The minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount noted above is primarily related to the reserves subject to the NICO reinsurance agreement.       The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined:                                 Six Months Ended June 30,   2011    2010      (in millions)   Gross   Net(b)   Gross   Net            Asbestos:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 5,526    $ 2,223    $ 3,236    $ 1,151        Losses and loss expenses incurred(a)      99      43      99      38        Losses and loss expenses paid(a)      (257 )    (135 )    (358 )    (114 )      Other changes      -      131      -      -            Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 5,368    $ 2,262    $ 2,977    $ 1,075            Environmental:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 240    $ 127    $ 338    $ 159        Losses and loss expenses incurred(a)      22      12      8      11        Losses and loss expenses paid(a)      (51 )    (25 )    (35 )    (17 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 211    $ 114    $ 311    $ 153            Combined:                                Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year    $ 5,766    $ 2,350    $ 3,574    $ 1,310        Losses and loss expenses incurred(a)      121      55      107      49        Losses and loss expenses paid(a)      (308 )    (160 )    (393 )    (131 )      Other changes      -      131      -      -            Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period    $ 5,579    $ 2,376    $ 3,288    $ 1,228               (a) All amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years, primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior years.

Survival Ratios — Asbestos and Environmental   The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at June 30, 2011 and 2010. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. In addition, AIG's survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007. These settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at June 30, 2010 by approximately 0.3 years and 0.7 years, respectively.   Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves are not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analysis. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.       The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                     2011    2010      Six Months Ended June 30,   Gross   Net*   Gross   Net            Survival ratios:                                Asbestos      8.9      9.9      4.6      4.2        Environmental      2.9      2.7      4.6      3.7        Combined      8.3      8.7      4.6      4.1               * Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis of presentation in the reserve activity table above, which excludes the effects of the NICO cession.  127      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries         SunAmerica Operations    SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups including term life, universal life, accident & health products, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct to-consumer platforms.   In managing SunAmerica, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization, and goodwill impairment charges. Operating income (loss) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of Operating income (loss) enhances the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of SunAmerica.

See Outlook herein for further discussion of incurred but not reported death claims. Net investment income declined due to $176 million of losses related to the valuation of ML II compared to income of $120 million in the same period in 2010.   •a $96 million increase in partnership income, and an increase in overall base yields due to the continued investment of cash and short-term investments into higher yielding securities.   •lower DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses due to improved equity market conditions in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.    Pre-tax income for SunAmerica reflected net capital gains in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to net capital losses in the same period in the prior year due principally to a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairments, a $487 million decline in fair value losses of embedded derivatives, net of economic hedges, driven by improved equity market conditions and $291 million of gains on the sale of securities. See Results of Operations — Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).   Year-to-Date SunAmerica Results   SunAmerica reported a decrease in operating income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, reflecting the following:    •lower net investment income and the $100 million increase in incurred but not reported death claims. Net investment income declined due to $205 million lower income related to the valuation of ML II, lower call and tender income and an overall decline in base yields as investment purchases in 2010 and early 2011 were made at yields lower than the weighted average yields of the base portfolio. However, as noted above, yields are expected to improve due to the continued investment of cash and short term investments.   •a $274 million increase in partnership income.   •declines in DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses due to improved equity market conditions and higher fee income due to increases in average separate account balances.    Pre-tax income for SunAmerica reflected a decline in net realized capital losses in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 due principally to a $722 million decline in other-than-temporary impairments, a $450 million decline in fair value losses of embedded derivatives, net of economic hedges, driven by improved equity market conditions, a decrease in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves, and $341 million of gains on the sale of securities.

The decline in life insurance deposits was primarily driven by lower institutional life, payout and deferred annuity sales. Individual fixed annuity deposits increased as certain bank distributors negotiated a lower commission in exchange for a higher rate offered to policyholders which made SunAmerica's individual fixed products more attractive. Variable annuity sales increased due to reinstatements at a number of key broker-dealers, increased wholesaler productivity and improvements in the equity markets. Retail mutual funds increased as a result of increased sales due to a sales strategy surrounding cyclical investment themes. Retail life insurance sales increased as product enhancements and efforts to re-engage independent distribution and improve productivity of the career agency force continue to produce results. Sales of large institutional life policies decreased from prior periods which included significant variable universal life sales.  131      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Domestic Retirement Services Sales and Deposits       The following table presents the account value rollforward for Domestic Retirement Services:                                     Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,      (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Group retirement products                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 70,565    $ 64,869    $ 68,365    $ 63,419        Deposits – annuities      1,303      1,273      2,594      2,527        Deposits – mutual funds      402      329      813      683              Total Deposits      1,705      1,602      3,407      3,210        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (1,448 )    (1,740 )    (2,951 )    (3,416 )      Death benefits      (90 )    (78 )    (173 )    (151 )            Net inflows (outflows)      167      (216 )    283      (357 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      401      (2,437 )    2,485      (846 )          Balance, end of period    $ 71,133    $ 62,216    $ 71,133    $ 62,216            Individual fixed annuities                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 49,854    $ 47,547    $ 48,489    $ 47,202        Deposits      2,018      1,277      4,169      2,430        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (913 )    (892 )    (1,753 )    (1,797 )      Death benefits      (425 )    (392 )    (827 )    (762 )            Net inflows (outflows)      680      (7 )    1,589      (129 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      460      458      916      925            Balance, end of period    $ 50,994    $ 47,998    $ 50,994    $ 47,998            Individual variable annuities                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 26,277    $ 24,866    $ 25,581    $ 24,637        Deposits      832      496      1,591      853        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (838 )    (687 )    (1,676 )    (1,361 )      Death benefits      (115 )    (106 )    (225 )    (226 )            Net outflows      (121 )    (297 )    (310 )    (734 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      (73 )    (1,251 )    812      (585 )          Balance, end of period    $ 26,083    $ 23,318    $ 26,083    $ 23,318            Total Domestic Retirement Services                              Balance, beginning of year    $ 146,696    $ 137,282    $ 142,435    $ 135,258        Deposits      4,555      3,375      9,167      6,493        Surrenders and other withdrawals      (3,199 )    (3,319 )    (6,380 )    (6,574 )      Death benefits      (630 )    (576 )    (1,225 )    (1,139 )            Net inflows (outflows)      726      (520 )    1,562      (1,220 )      Change in fair value of underlying investments, interest credited, net of fees      788      (3,230 )    4,213      (506 )            Balance, end of period, excluding runoff      148,210      133,532      148,210      133,532        Individual annuities runoff      4,346      4,526      4,346      4,526        GIC runoff      6,836      8,361      6,836      8,361            Balance, end of period    $ 159,392    $ 146,419    $ 159,392    $ 146,419            General and separate account reserves and mutual funds                                General account reserve    $ 99,159    $ 97,129    $ 99,159    $ 97,129        Separate account reserve      50,418      41,779      50,418      41,779            Total general and separate account reserves      149,577      138,908      149,577      138,908        Group retirement mutual funds      9,815      7,511      9,815      7,511            Total reserves and mutual funds    $ 159,392    $ 146,419    $ 159,392    $ 146,419             132      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Net flows improved in 2011 due to the impact of both the significant increase in deposits and continued favorable surrender experience in group retirement and individual fixed annuities. Surrender rates for individual fixed annuities have decreased in 2011 due to the low interest rate environment and the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. Surrender rates for group retirement products declined due to a decrease in certain large group surrenders. SunAmerica has returned to a more normal level of group surrender activity that no longer reflects the negative AIG publicity associated with the events of 2008 and 2009.       The following table presents reserves by surrender charge category and surrender rates:                                           2011    2010      At June 30, (in millions)   Group Retirement Products*   Individual Fixed Annuities   Individual Variable Annuities   Group Retirement Products*   Individual Fixed Annuities   Individual Variable Annuities              No surrender charge    $ 54,369    $ 15,639    $ 12,085    $ 47,829    $ 12,719    $ 10,230        0% - 2%      1,210      3,500      3,855      1,203      3,492      3,701        Greater than 2% - 4%      1,400      5,180      2,279      1,767      5,329      1,720        Greater than 4%      3,562      23,567      7,701      2,993      23,314      6,472        Non-Surrenderable      777      3,108      163      913      3,144      1,195              Total reserves    $ 61,318    $ 50,994    $ 26,083    $ 54,705    $ 47,998    $ 23,318            Surrender rates      8.4 %    7.1 %    12.9 %    10.7 %    7.6 %    11.4 %             * Excludes mutual funds of $9.8 billion and $7.5 billion at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.       The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in SunAmerica DAC/VOBA:                           Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)   2011   2010            Balance, beginning of year    $ 9,606    $ 11,098        Acquisition costs deferred      608      489        Amortization expense*      (678 )    (457 )      Change in unrealized losses on securities      (398 )    (981 )          Balance, end of period    $ 9,138    $ 10,149               * Net of benefit of DAC and VOBA related to net realized capital losses.    As SunAmerica operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.   DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, SunAmerica's DAC and VOBA may be subject to an impairment charge and its results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.       Financial Services Operations    AIG's Financial Services subsidiaries engage primarily in commercial aircraft leasing and the management of the remaining Capital Markets derivatives portfolio.   AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Aircraft Leasing operations also  133      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.   AIG's Capital Markets operations consist of the management of the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio. The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed at the end of the second quarter of 2011. The remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis, although the portfolio may experience periodic mark-to-market volatility. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio, reduce risk and hedge the currency, interest rate and other market risks associated with the businesses of other AIG subsidiaries.

Quarterly Aircraft Leasing Results   ILFC pre-tax income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, lower rental revenues as a result of a reduction in its aircraft fleet and lower lease rates on used aircraft. These results were partially offset by lower depreciation expense and lower impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges recorded on aircraft. During the second quarter of 2011, ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $42 million related primarily to sales and potential sales of seven aircraft compared to charges of $66 million in the same period in 2010 related to sales and potential sales of eight aircraft.   Year-to-Date Aircraft Leasing Results   ILFC pre-tax income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to lower impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges recorded on aircraft. ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $155 million related primarily to sales and potential sales of 17 aircraft compared to charges of $497 million in the same period in 2010 related to sales and potential sales of 63 aircraft. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, ILFC also recorded a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, incurred increased interest expense driven by  134      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  higher composite borrowing rates, and recorded lower rental revenues and depreciation expense as a result of a reduction in its aircraft fleet compared to the same period in 2010 and lower lease rates on used aircraft.   Quarterly Capital Markets Results   Capital Markets reported a higher pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to unrealized market valuation losses related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio, partially offset by improvement related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities as well as lower operating expenses. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, Capital Markets recorded an unrealized market valuation loss of $94 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $161 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010. The loss resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price decreases on the underlying assets. (See Critical Accounting Estimates — Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities — Level 3 Assets and Liabilities for a discussion of Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio.) With respect to the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value, Capital Markets incurred a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $2 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $138 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010.   Year-to-Date Capital Markets Results   Capital Markets reported pre-tax income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2010 primarily due to the valuation of Capital Markets derivative assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value. Capital Markets recorded a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $26 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $316 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, Capital Markets recorded an unrealized market valuation gain of $229 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $280 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010. The gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price improvement and amortization of the underlying assets. Operating expenses were significantly lower during the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.       Other Operations    AIG's Other operations includes results from Parent & Other operations, after allocations to AIG's business segments, Mortgage Guaranty operations, Asset Management operations, and results from those divested businesses not included in Discontinued operations.   AIG's Parent & Other operations consist primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate-level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, and net gains and losses on sale of divested businesses which did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment. In addition, fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA and in the MetLife securities received as consideration from the sale of ALICO are included in Parent & Other.   Divested businesses include results of certain businesses that have been divested or are being wound down or repositioned.  135                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Other Results   The following table presents pre-tax income for AIG's Other operations:                                          Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,              Percentage Change   Percentage Change     (in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010            Parent & Other:                                            Intercompany interest income, net    $ 2    $ 144      (99 )%  $ 12    $ 298      (96 )%      Interest expense on FRBNY Credit Facility      -      (755 )    -      (72 )    (1,588 )    95        Other interest expense      (420 )    (484 )    13      (847 )    (959 )    12        Unallocated corporate expenses      (261 )    (761 )    66      (329 )    (941 )    65        Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to the sale      -      -      -      (157 )    -      -        Change in fair value of AIA securities      1,521      -      -      2,583      -      -        Loss on extinguishment of debt      (18 )    -      -      (3,331 )    -      -        Net realized capital gains (losses)      (46 )    409      -      (467 )    694      -        Net gain (loss) on sale of divested businesses      (2 )    198      -      (74 )    122      -        Other miscellaneous, net      72      10      620      89      37      141            Total Parent & Other    $ 848    $ (1,239 )    - %  $ (2,593 )  $ (2,337 )    (11 )%          Other businesses:                                            Mortgage Guaranty    $ 7    $ 245      (97 )%  $ 14    $ 341      (96 )%      Asset Management:                                              Direct Investment Book      112      118      (5 )    560      (29 )    -          Institutional Asset Management      (8 )    -      -      7      (74 )    -        Divested businesses      25      782      (97 )    47      1,457      (97 )      Change in fair value of ML III      (667 )    358      -      77      1,109      (93 )          Total Other businesses    $ (531 )  $ 1,503      - %  $ 705    $ 2,804      (75 )%          Total Other operations    $ 317    $ 264      20 %  $ (1,888 )  $ 467      - %            Parent & Other   Parent & Other reported pre-tax income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2010 primarily due to:    •fair value gains of $1.5 billion on AIG's equity interest in AIA;   •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and   •a reduction in unallocated corporate expenses, principally due to securities litigation-related charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.    Parent & Other reported an increased pre-tax loss in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in connection with the Recapitalization, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility and net realized capital losses recorded in the first six months of 2011 compared to net realized capital gains in the same period in 2010.   This loss was partially offset by:    •a $2.6 billion increase in fair value of AIG's equity interest in AIA;   •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and   •a reduction in unallocated corporate expenses noted above.   136      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Other Businesses   Mortgage Guaranty   The main business of the subsidiaries of UGC is the issuance of residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one- to four-family residences.       Quarterly Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to:    •declines in earned premiums from the second-lien, private student loan and international businesses resulting from these businesses being placed into runoff during the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by an increase in earned premiums from first-lien business;   •an increase in claims and claims adjustment expenses for the first-lien and second-lien businesses, partially offset by declines for the student loan and international businesses. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses include provisions for increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims and unfavorable reserve development in the current period compared to favorable development experienced in the same period in 2010, primarily in first-lien business. The increased overturns result from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses were partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher denials and rescissions, primarily on first-lien claims, and a reduction in reserves due to an agreement to resolve certain delinquencies with a major European lender that resulted in a $43 million benefit; and   •a reduction in underwriting expenses reflecting a $64 million accrual of estimated remedy losses in 2010. Remedy losses represent the indemnification for losses incurred by lenders arising from obligations contractually assumed by UGC as a result of underwriting services provided to lenders during times of high loan origination activity. UGC believes it has adequately accrued for these losses at June 30, 2011.    UGC, like other participants in the mortgage insurance industry, has made claims against various counterparties in relation to alleged underwriting failures, and received similar claims from counterparties. These claims and counterclaims allege breach of contract, breach of good faith and fraud, among other allegations. These claims and counter claims are currently being litigated and UGC cannot assess the ultimate outcome or quantify its ultimate liability, if any, for these unresolved legal matters.       Year-to-Date Mortgage Guaranty Results   Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to:    •declines in earned premiums from the second-lien, private student loan and international businesses resulting from these businesses being placed into runoff during the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by an increase in earned premiums from first-lien business;   •an increase in claims and claims adjustment expenses for the first-lien and second-lien businesses, partially offset by declines for the student loan and international businesses. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses include provisions for increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims and lower favorable development than experienced in the same period in 2010, primarily in first-lien business. The increased overturns result from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues. The higher claims and claims adjustment expenses were partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products and higher denials   137      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   and rescissions, primarily on first-lien claims and a reduction in reserves due to an agreement to resolve certain delinquencies with a major European lender discussed above; and    •the $64 million accrual of estimated remedy losses in 2010 discussed above.        Risk-in-Force  The following table presents risk in force and delinquency ratio information for UGC's domestic business:                         At June 30, (dollars in billions)   2011   2010            Domestic first-lien:                    Risk in force    $ 24.7    $ 25.9        60+ day delinquency ratio on primary loans(a)      14.6 %    18.5 %    Domestic second-lien:                    Risk in force(b)    $ 1.7    $ 2.4               (a) Based on number of policies. (b)Represents the full amount of second-lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans, usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool. Certain second-lien pools have reinstatement provisions, which will expire as the loan balances are repaid.   Change in Fair Value of ML III   The loss attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 was due to significant spread widening in the quarter. The small gain for the six-month period was due to the loss from significant spread widening in the current period that offset almost the entire gain from credit spreads and cash flow improvement in the first three months of 2011.   Asset Management Operations   AIG's Asset Management operations include the results of the Direct Investment book and the Institutional Asset Management business.   The revenues of the Institutional Asset Management business are primarily derived from providing asset management services to AIG and its subsidiaries and are eliminated in AIG's consolidated financial results. The Direct Investment book's operating results are impacted by performance in the credit, equity and real estate markets.       Direct Investment Book Results   The Direct Investment book includes results for the MIP, AIG Global Real Estate and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP now managed by the Asset Management Group.   The Direct Investment book's pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to lower credit valuation adjustments on the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP accounted for under the fair value option, partially offset by improved operating results of AIG Global Real Estate due to lower impairment charges on real estate investments. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Direct Investment book reported pre-tax operating income due to lower impairments on fixed maturity and real estate investments primarily due to market stabilization partially offset by lower credit valuation adjustments on the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP.  138      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the Direct Investment book (excluding intercompany transactions):                          (in millions)                       Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       Three Months Ended June 30, 2011                      Bond trading securities    $ (43 )  Notes and bonds payable    $ 14      Loans and other assets      2    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      22                GIAs      20                Other liabilities      1                Decrease in assets    $ (41 )  Decrease in liabilities    $ 57                Net pre-tax increase to Other income    $ 16                      Three Months Ended June 30, 2010                      Bond trading securities   $ 247    Notes and bonds payable   $ 73      Loans and other assets     (1 )  Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     85                GIAs     66                Other liabilities     13                Increase in assets   $ 246    Decrease in liabilities   $ 237                Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 483                                                   (in millions)                       Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets    AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities       Six Months Ended June 30, 2011                      Bond trading securities    $ 282    Notes and bonds payable    $ (4 )    Loans and other assets      18    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities      (8 )              GIAs      29                Other liabilities      (1 )              Increase in assets    $ 300    Decrease in liabilities    $ 16                Net pre-tax increase to Other income    $ 316                      Six Months Ended June 30, 2010                      Bond trading securities   $ 1,070    Notes and bonds payable   $ (123 )    Loans and other assets     45    Hybrid financial instrument liabilities     (164 )              GIAs     (79 )              Other liabilities     (24 )              Increase in assets   $ 1,115    Increase in liabilities   $ (390 )              Net pre-tax increase to Other income   $ 725                              Institutional Asset Management Results   Institutional Asset Management includes AIG's internal asset management business and AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets). AIG Markets acts as a derivative intermediary transacting with AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties.   Institutional Asset Management recognized a pre-tax operating loss in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, driven by fair value adjustments on derivative positions due to changes in counterparty credit risk and portfolio composition. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, Institutional Asset Management recognized  139      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  an increase in pre-tax operating income due to the sale of AIG third-party asset management business and deconsolidation of certain private equity investments, which significantly reduced operating expenses.   Divested Businesses   Divested businesses include the operating results of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting through the date of their sale as well as certain non-core businesses currently in run-off. The Divested businesses results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 primarily represent the historical results of AIA, which was deconsolidated in November 2010.      Capital Resources and Liquidity       Overview   AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are short-term investments and borrowing availability under syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities. Subject to market conditions, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs, which include the payment of maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries.       Liquidity Adequacy Management    In 2010, AIG implemented a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess AIG's aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIG's existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two-year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks.   AIG's insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERM's stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation in order to determine AIG Parent's liquidity requirements to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required under stressed scenarios for non-insurance operations, including the AIGFP derivatives portfolio, the Direct Investment book and ILFC.   AIG's consolidated risk target is to maintain a minimum liquidity buffer such that AIG Parent's liquidity requirements under the ERM stress scenarios do not exceed 80 percent of AIG Parent's overall liquidity sources over the specified two-year horizon. If the 80 percent minimum threshold is projected to be breached over this defined time horizon, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the target threshold, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions.   As a result of these ERM stress tests at June 30, 2011 and other considerations discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.   During the first quarter of 2011, AIG entered into unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain domestic Chartis and SAFG insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Chartis, and Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — SunAmerica below.  140      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash   The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                         Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions)   2011   2010            Summary:                    Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities    $ (3,464 )  $ 9,771        Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities      37,748      (6,067 )      Net cash used in financing activities      (33,714 )    (4,527 )      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash      29      (92 )          Increase (decrease) in cash      599      (915 )    Cash at beginning of year      1,558      4,400      Change in cash of businesses held for sale      433      (645 )          Cash at end of period    $ 2,590    $ 2,840              Net cash used in operating activities for the first six months of 2011 reflects the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued compounded interest and fees totaling $6.4 billion, which in prior periods were paid in kind and, accordingly did not reduce operating cash flow in prior periods.   Excluding the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued interest and fees, AIG generated positive operating cash flows in both periods. Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits, but the ability of Chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by operating expenses, the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies and policy retention rates. Cash used by Chartis operations was $398 million for the first six months of 2011 compared to $729 million in the same period of 2010. Catastrophic events and significant casualty losses, the timing and effect of which are inherently unpredictable, reduce operating cash flow for Chartis operations. Additionally, during the second quarter 2011, Chartis completed a transaction with NICO, under which Chartis paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for the cession of a majority of Chartis' U.S. net asbestos liabilities.   Cash provided by AIG's life insurance subsidiaries, including entities presented as discontinued operations, was $2.4 billion for the first six months of 2011 compared to $6.6 billion in the same period in 2010, as 2010 included operating cash flows from divested foreign life insurance subsidiaries including AIA and ALICO. Cash used by Financial Services was $854 million for the first six months of 2011, compared to cash provided of $2.7 billion for the same period in 2010, primarily attributable to the active wind-down of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio, which was completed at the end of the second quarter of 2011.   The AIGFP derivatives portfolio wind-down and other segment developments affecting pre-tax income (loss) described above are discussed further in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — Capital Markets.   The significant increase in cash from investing activities in the first six months of 2011 was driven by the deployment in connection with the Recapitalization of restricted cash generated from the AIA IPO and ALICO sale, the disposition of MetLife securities, sales and maturities of available for sale fixed maturity securities and hybrid investments, primarily at Chartis and SunAmerica Financial Group. Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities, resulting from AIG's investment of cash generated from operating activities, and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in 2008 and 2009.   Net cash used in financing activities for the first six months of 2011 primarily represents the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $9.1 billion partial repayment of the SPV Preferred Interests on January 14, 2011 in connection with the Recapitalization described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  141                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries    AIG Parent   The Recapitalization in January 2011 involved a series of integrated transactions which directly impacted AIG Parent's liquidity activities and position. These transactions included the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the repurchase and exchange of the SPV Preferred Interests. These transactions are excluded from the Sources and Uses discussion below.   In addition, in the first six months of 2011, several significant asset sales were completed, including the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison in February 2011and the sale of MetLife securities in March 2011. These transactions are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are excluded from the Sources and Uses discussion below.   On May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. A portion of the net proceeds AIG received from this offering, $550 million, is available to fund a litigation settlement, and AIG intends to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.   Sources of Liquidity   AIG Parent's primary sources of cash flow are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries. In the first six months of 2011, AIG Parent collected $291 million in payments from subsidiaries, including a $130 million dividend from Chartis in the second quarter of 2011. AIG Parent received liquidity from SunAmerica through the repayment of intercompany loans (see SunAmerica below.) In addition, AIG raised approximately $2.9 billion in net proceeds from the sale of AIG Common Stock discussed under Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — AIG Parent above.   AIG has established and maintains substantial sources of actual and contingent liquidity.  The following table presents AIG Parent's sources of liquidity. This does not include liquidity that is expected to result from cash flows from operations:                     (in millions)   As of June 30, 2011            Cash(a)(b)    $ 598      Short-term investments(a)      8,797      Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities      3,182      Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facility      500            Total AIG Parent liquidity sources(b)    $ 13,077               (a) Excludes Cash and Short-term Investments held by AIGFP, which are considered to be unrestricted and available for use by AIG Parent of $411 million at June 30, 2011. (b)Includes $492 million related to unsettled securities purchased under resale agreements which settled in July 2011.   AIG's ability to borrow under the syndicated credit and contingent liquidity facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings. For further discussion of the terms and conditions relating to the bank credit facilities, see Credit Facilities below.   AIG expects to establish an additional contingent liquidity facility during the third quarter of 2011. Under this facility, AIG will have the unconditional right, for a period of five years, to issue up to $750 million in senior debt to an unaffiliated international financial institution, at its discretion, based on a put option agreement between AIG and the financial institution.  142      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  For additional information on the existing contingent liquidity facility, see Debt below. The Series G Drawdown Right was terminated in connection with the May 2011 offering and sale of AIG Common Stock.   Uses of Liquidity   AIG's primary uses of cash flow are for debt service, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In the first six months of 2011, AIG Parent retired $3.6 billion of debt of which $1.4 billion is debt retirement of MIP, and made interest payments totaling $1.3 billion. Approximately $4.2 billion of AIG Parent's cash and short-term investment balances is attributable to the MIP and is available to meet obligations of the MIP. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Other Operations — Direct Investment Book below for additional details.   AIG Parent made $3.8 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the first six months of 2011, of which $3.7 billion was contributed to Chartis as a result of the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. This transaction was funded from the retention of $2 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison (for which the Department of the Treasury provided a waiver permitting AIG to use such proceeds for this purpose instead of using the proceeds to repay SPV Preferred Interests) and available cash at AIG Parent.   AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the AIG Parent level to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. No assurance can be given, however, that AIG's cash needs will not exceed projected liquidity. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, further downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or both. Regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.   Chartis   AIG currently expects that its Chartis subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Chartis subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $12.9 billion as of June 30, 2011. Further, Chartis businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which Chartis could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient. In the first quarter of 2011, Chartis received a capital contribution of $3.7 billion in cash from AIG as a result of the reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2010. Chartis used $1.8 billion of this amount to purchase certain assets from the Direct Investment book (DIB). Additionally, Chartis subsequently returned capital to AIG Parent of $2.2 billion in the form of all of the outstanding stock of UGC in the first quarter of 2011. In the second quarter of 2011, Chartis paid a dividend of $130 million to AIG Parent.   One or more large catastrophes may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected Chartis operations. In addition, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the relevant subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations, and require AIG to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of Chartis subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to Chartis operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.   In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain Chartis domestic property and casualty insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined under applicable insurance laws). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these Chartis insurance companies is in excess of a  143      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs (as reflected in the companies' quarterly or annual statutory financial statements), subject to board and regulatory approval(s), the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage.   Chartis continues to identify cost effective opportunities to manage its capital allocation through the use of intercompany reinsurance.   SunAmerica   Management considers the sources of liquidity for SunAmerica subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. The SunAmerica companies continue to maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $4.6 billion as of June 30, 2011. These subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed income securities in order to reduce the levels of cash, cash equivalents and other short-term instruments that had been maintained during 2009 and 2010. In the first six months of 2011, the SunAmerica companies paid dividends and surplus note interest totaling approximately $618 million to their respective holding companies, which used the funds to provide liquidity to AIG Parent through the repayment of intercompany loans.   The most significant potential liquidity requirements of SunAmerica companies are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of SunAmerica's investment portfolios, AIG believes that any deviations from projected claim experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk.   In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain SunAmerica insurance companies. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies at or above a specified minimum percentage of the companies' projected company action level RBCs (as defined under applicable insurance laws). In addition, the CMAs also provide that if the total adjusted capital of these SunAmerica insurance companies is in excess of a specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs (as reflected in the companies' quarterly or annual statutory financial statements), subject to board and regulatory approval(s), the companies would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their equity holders in amounts representing the excess over that required to maintain the specified minimum percentage.   Financial Services   AIG's major Financial Services operations at June 30, 2011 consist of ILFC and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP.   International Lease Finance Corporation   ILFC's sources of liquidity include existing cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments. In 2011, ILFC improved its liquidity position by entering into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility and a secured $1.5 billion term loan facility. In addition, on May 24, 2011, ILFC issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with $1.0 billion maturing in 2016 and $1.25 billion maturing in 2019. On June 17, 2011, ILFC completed tender offers for the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with maturity dates in 2012 and 2013 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt.   See Debt — Debt Maturities — ILFC for further details on ILFC's outstanding debt.   Capital Markets   Due to the wind-down of AIGFP's remaining derivatives portfolio, AIGFP continues to rely upon AIG Parent to meet most of its collateral and other liquidity requirements.  144      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by the Capital Markets operations:                              (in millions)   Collateral Posted as of December 31, 2010   Additional Postings, Netted by Counterparty   Collateral Returned by Counterparties   Collateral Posted as of June 30, 2011            Super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio   $ 3,786   $ 286   $ 861   $ 3,211      All other derivatives     1,335     979     506     1,808            Total   $ 5,121   $ 1,265   $ 1,367   $ 5,019              During 2010, AIG's Asset Management Group undertook the management responsibilities for certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP.

Accordingly, gains and losses related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP, primarily consisting of credit valuation adjustment gains and losses, are reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of Asset Management — Direct Investment book. For additional details regarding liquidity consideration related to these assets and liabilities, see Other Operations below.  The following table presents the net notional amount and number of outstanding trade positions in AIGFP's portfolios:                           (dollars in billions)   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010   Percentage Decrease            Net notional amount(a)    $ 198    $ 341      (42 )%    Super senior CDS contracts (included in net notional amount above)      29      60      (52 )    Outstanding trade positions(b)      2,200      3,900      (44 )             (a) Excludes $8.0 billion and $11.5 billion of intercompany derivatives at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (b)Excludes approximately 4,800 non-derivative trade positions that were transferred to Direct Investment book in 2010.   The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed at the end of the second quarter of 2011. The remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis, although the portfolio may experience periodic mark-to-market volatility.   Other Operations   Mortgage Guaranty   AIG currently expects that its UGC subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. UGC subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $1.1 billion as of June 30, 2011. Further, UGC businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed income securities, including substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds, which UGC could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient.   Direct Investment Book   The DIB includes results for the MIP, AIG Global Real Estate and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP now managed by the Asset Management Group. AIG's existing CDS contracts for the MIP under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements may require collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels.  145      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  While a significant portion of the DIB's liquidity requirements are supported by existing liquidity sources or maturing investments, mismatches in the timing of cash inflows and outflows may require assets to be sold to satisfy liquidity requirements. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets if required, proceeds from asset sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount required. Management believes that sufficient liquidity is maintained by the DIB to meet near-term liquidity requirements. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. The amount of collateral posted by the DIB for collateralized GIAs as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.   During the first six months of 2011, $1.8 billion of assets held by the DIB were sold to certain Chartis U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, during the first six months of 2011, AIG assigned approximately 52 percent of AIG's interest in Maiden Lane III to the DIB, subject to liens on those interests as set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement dated December 8, 2010, among AIG Parent, AM Holdings LLC (formerly known as ALICO Holdings LLC), AIA Aurora LLC, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury, and the Trust.   Institutional Asset Management   AIG Markets, which acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties, executes its derivative trades (interest rate and foreign exchange swaps and forwards) under ISDA agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of AIG Markets' transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties.       Debt    Debt Maturities  The following table summarizes maturing debt at June 30, 2011 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                 (in millions)   Third Quarter 2011   Fourth Quarter 2011   First Quarter 2012   Second Quarter 2012   Total            ILFC   $ 2,244   $ 328   $ 1,052   $ 570   $ 4,194      Borrowings supported by assets (DIB)     1,287     1,425     1,355     1,960     6,027      General borrowings     -     623     27     -     650      Other     1     1     1     1     4            Total   $ 3,532   $ 2,377   $ 2,435   $ 2,531   $ 10,875              AIG's plans for meeting these maturing obligations are as follows:    •ILFC's sources of liquidity available to meet these needs include existing cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion, future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. (See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries — Financial Services — ILFC.) In 2011, ILFC entered into an unsecured $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility and a secured $1.5 billion term loan facility. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations.   •AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt being managed in the DIB. At June 30, 2011, all of the debt maturities in the DIB through June 30, 2012 are supported by maturities of investments and short-term investments. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. Subject to market conditions, AIG expects from time to time to access the debt capital markets when necessary to fund any such shortfall.   146      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table provides the rollforward of AIG's total debt outstanding:                                     Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 (in millions)   Balance at December 31, 2010   Issuances   Maturities and Repayments   Effect of Foreign Exchange   Other Changes   Balance at June 30, 2011            Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                          General borrowings:                                            FRBNY Credit Facility    $ 20,985    $ -    $ (20,985 )(a)  $ -    $ -    $ -        Notes and bonds payable      11,511      -      -      118      -      11,629        Junior subordinated debt      11,740      -      -      282      1      12,023        Junior subordinated debt attributable to equity units      2,169      -      (2,169 )(b)    -      -      -        Loans and mortgages payable      218      150      (147 )    1      1      223        SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc.

Credit Facilities   AIG relies on credit facilities as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Currently, AIG, Chartis and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities and a letter of credit facility summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes. AIG and Chartis intend to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. One of the facilities, as noted below, contains a "term-out option" allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. All facilities, except for the ILFC five-year syndicated credit facility maturing October 2012, are unsecured.

AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, including covenants relating to AIG's maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict AIG's access to the facilities and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIG's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.   The Chartis letter of credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit in favor of certain of its general insurance companies to permit those companies to obtain statutory recognition of reinsurance recoverables from unauthorized reinsurers. This facility requires Chartis to maintain a minimum combined statutory surplus and a minimum combined net worth, and contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to incurrence of certain types of indebtedness or liens, certain dispositions, entry into certain restrictive agreements and transactions with affiliates and certain fundamental changes, as well as customary events of default. At June 30, 2011, the Chartis letter of credit facility was fully drawn and no additional amounts are available under this facility.   ILFC's three-year credit facility which became effective January 31, 2011 contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that require ILFC to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a maximum ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth. Prior to April 16, 2010, ILFC had a $2.5 billion five-year syndicated facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. On April 16, 2010, ILFC amended and extended the maturity date of $2.16 billion of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from October 2011 to October 2012. Upon effectiveness of these amendments, the previously unsecured bank debt became secured by the equity interest in certain of ILFC's non-restricted subsidiaries, which hold a pool of aircraft with an appraised value of not less than 133 percent of the principal amount of the outstanding loans. In December 2010, ILFC paid down $800 million on the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. In June 2011, ILFC paid down an additional $200 million, bringing the revolving credit facility size down to $1.5 billion. The amended facility prohibits ILFC from re-borrowing amounts repaid under this facility for any reason; therefore, the size of the outstanding revolving credit facility is $1.5 billion.   Credit Ratings   The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short- and long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of July 29, 2011. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.   These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.   "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.   A significant portion of the GIAs, structured financing arrangements and financial derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings or, with the consent of the counterparties, assignment or repayment of the positions or arrangement of a substitute guarantee of AIG's obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. Furthermore, certain downgrades of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings would permit either AIG or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts.   The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of AIG's insurance companies or AIG's credit ratings, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                            Payments due by Period      June 30, 2011  (in millions)           Total Payments   Remainder of 2011   2012 - 2013   2014 - 2015   2016   Thereafter            Loss reserves   $ 94,932   $ 11,582   $ 30,568   $ 16,850   $ 5,506   $ 30,426      Insurance and investment contract liabilities     446,732     12,928     26,822     25,755     12,805     368,422      Aircraft purchase commitments     17,652     87     1,451     4,103     2,899     9,112      Borrowings     77,142     5,909     14,410     9,267     6,393     41,163      Interest payments on borrowings     45,608     1,923     7,694     6,635     2,897     26,459      Other long-term obligations(a)     200     50     33     11     -     106            Total(b)   $ 682,266   $ 32,479   $ 80,978   $ 62,621   $ 30,500   $ 475,688               (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (b)Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $5.1 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of Capital Markets credit default swaps require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At June 30, 2011, the fair value derivative liability was $3.2 billion, relating to AIGFP's super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, realized in extinguishing derivative obligations. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, at June 30, 2011 AIGFP had posted collateral of $2.7 billion with respect to these swaps.  150                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                             Amount of Commitment Expiration      June 30, 2011  (in millions)           Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2011   2012 - 2013   2014 - 2015   2016   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 709   $ -   $ 608   $ -   $ -   $ 101        Standby letters of credit     779     754     14     9     1     1        Guarantees of indebtedness     219     -     -     -     -     219        All other guarantees(b)     561     32     176     198     -     155      Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(c)     3,316     2,456     789     33     38     -        Commitments to extend credit     306     223     58     24     -     1        Letters of credit     1,551     1,466     85     -     -     -        Other commercial commitments(d)     699     11     -     -     -     688            Total(e)   $ 8,140   $ 4,942   $ 1,730   $ 264   $ 39   $ 1,165               (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (b)Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and SunAmerica construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnifications included in asset sales agreements. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c)Includes commitments to invest in limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in limited partnerships and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (d)Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2011 is expected to be approximately $32 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. (e)Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.       Securities Financing    The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.       Dividend Restrictions    See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG subsidiaries.       Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities    While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  151      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     Investments       Investment Strategy   AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.   At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities. In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the Direct Investment book, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration. Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in Chartis U.S. historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. In order to meet the current risk/return and tax objectives of Chartis U.S., the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax-exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by Chartis International companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.   The market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components, including interest rate environment, credit spread, embedded optionality (such as call features), liquidity, structural complexity, foreign exchange risk and other credit and non-credit factors. However, in most circumstances, pricing is most sensitive to interest rates, such that the market price declines as interest rates rise, and increases as interest rates fall. This effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities.   AIG accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value. However, with limited exceptions (primarily with respect to separate account products on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet), AIG does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates, even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities, and falling interest rates have the opposite effect. This results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains (losses) on securities in Accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative, inverse changes in gains (losses) on AIG's liabilities. Because AIG's asset duration in certain low-yield currencies, particularly Japan and Taiwan, is shorter than its liability duration, AIG views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous, notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio.   At June 30, 2011, approximately 88 percent of the fixed maturity securities were held by domestic entities. Approximately 24 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Approximately 13 percent were below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.   A significant portion of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG's Credit Risk Committee closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2011, approximately 29 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 3 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 38 percent of the foreign fixed maturity portfolio is sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  152      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Investment Highlights   An overview of noteworthy investment activities during the second quarter of 2011 is provided below:    •deployment of approximately $25 billion from cash and short-term investments to higher yielding fixed income securities for the quarter ($47 billion year to date) in insurance operations;     •Corporate debt investments (primarily investment grade) accounted for approximately half of new purchases, and risk weighted opportunistic investments in structured securities were made to improve yields and increase investment income; and   •Base yields improved at both Chartis and SunAmerica in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2011 as a result of cash deployment activities, although the low rate environment has a continued effect on portfolio yields as new money rates are generally lower than maturing or called investment yields.    •continued reduction of the tax exempt municipal bond portfolio exposure with approximately $5 billion in sales;   •lower partnership income in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2011 (primarily equity market driven); however, annualized returns still approximated 10 percent in the quarter, consistent with the second quarter of 2010;   •negative fair value changes on the residual Maiden Lane Interests driven by widening spreads, which had a dampening effect on the second quarter 2011 net investment income as the combined effects were approximately $1.8 billion lower than the first quarter 2011 fair value changes and $1.3 billion lower than the second quarter of 2010;   •$2.2 billion unrealized appreciation in AIG's invested asset portfolio driven by lower yields across most asset classes. The exception was the high yield asset class;   •$661 million of realized gains on sales of securities in the second quarter of 2011, of which approximately half was derived from the municipal bond portfolio reduction strategy; and   •other-than-temporary impairments of $181 million in the second quarter of 2011. Other-than-temporary impairments on structured securities continued to trend lower.    The credit ratings table below reflects (a) the ratings on AIG's fixed maturity investments at June 30, 2011 by one or more of the major rating agencies or by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) AIG's equivalent internal ratings where the investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in the table consists of fixed maturity investments that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or AIG, and represents primarily AIG's interest in ML III.

AIG's underwriting practices for investing in RMBS, other asset-backed securities and CDOs take into consideration the quality of the originator, the manager, the servicer, security credit ratings, underlying characteristics of the mortgages, borrower characteristics, and the level of credit enhancement in the transaction.  159      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Investments in CMBS   The following table presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains (losses) and fair value of AIG's CMBS investments:                                                    June 30, 2011    December 31, 2010      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            CMBS (traditional)    $ 6,459    $ 331    $ (554 )  $ 6,236      81 %  $ 6,428    $ 204    $ (919 )  $ 5,713      88 %    ReRemic/CRE CDO      434      51      (131 )    354      5      508      23      (219 )    312      7      Agency      1,036      29      (1 )    1,064      13      297      13      (1 )    309      4      Other      83      -      (7 )    76      1      87      -      (10 )    77      1            Total    $ 8,012    $ 411    $ (693 )  $ 7,730      100 %  $ 7,320    $ 240    $ (1,149 )  $ 6,411      100 %           The following table presents AIG's CMBS investments by year of vintage:                                                    June 30, 2011    December 31, 2010      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Year:                                                                  2011    $ 940    $ 13    $ (3 )  $ 950      12 %  $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -      - %    2010      205      5      -      210      3      86      -      -      86      1      2009      43      1      -      44      -      42      1      -      43      1      2008      217      4      (4 )    217      3      217      8      (1 )    224      3      2007      2,141      186      (317 )    2,010      26      2,205      118      (484 )    1,839      30      2006 and prior      4,466      202      (369 )    4,299      56      4,770      113      (664 )    4,219      65            Total    $ 8,012    $ 411    $ (693 )  $ 7,730      100 %  $ 7,320    $ 240    $ (1,149 )  $ 6,411      100 %                  The following table presents AIG's CMBS investments by credit rating:                                                       June 30, 2011    December 31, 2010      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Rating:                                                                    AAA    $ 3,152    $ 115    $ (10 )  $ 3,257      39 %  $ 2,416    $ 88    $ (21 )  $ 2,483      33 %      AA      715      13      (26 )    702      9      772      7      (94 )    685      11        A      1,030      22      (51 )    1,001      13      1,061      18      (100 )    979      14        BBB      684      10      (56 )    638      9      1,140      12      (302 )    850      16        Below investment grade      2,418      250      (550 )    2,118      30      1,931      115      (632 )    1,414      26        Non-rated      13      1      -      14      -      -      -      -      -      -            Total    $ 8,012    $ 411    $ (693 )  $ 7,730      100 %  $ 7,320    $ 240    $ (1,149 )  $ 6,411      100 %           160                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  The following table presents the percentage of AIG's CMBS investments by geographic region based on amortized cost:                            June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Geographic region:                   New York      15 %    17 %     California      11      12       Texas      6      6       Florida      5      6       Virginia      3      3       Illinois      3      3       New Jersey      2      3       Georgia      2      3       Maryland      2      2       Pennsylvania      2      2       Nevada      2      2       Washington      2      2       All Other*      45      39            Total      100 %    100 %           * Includes Non-U.S. locations.

Although the market value of CMBS holdings has improved and CMBS spreads have tightened during the first six months of 2011, the portfolio continues to be below amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.  161      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Investments in CDOs   The following table presents AIG's CDO investments by collateral type:                                                     June 30, 2011    December 31, 2010      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Collateral Type:                                                                    Bank loans (CLO)    $ 1,848    $ 83    $ (184 )  $ 1,747      84 %  $ 1,697    $ 62    $ (321 )  $ 1,438      76 %      Synthetic investment grade      16      103      -      119      1      78      102      (2 )    178      4        Other      310      190      (18 )    482      14      433      151      (52 )    532      19        Subprime ABS      17      4      (8 )    13      1      24      2      (12 )    14      1            Total    $ 2,191    $ 380    $ (210 )  $ 2,361      100 %  $ 2,232    $ 317    $ (387 )  $ 2,162      100 %           The following table presents AIG's CDO investments by credit rating:                                                     June 30, 2011    December 31, 2010      (in millions)   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost   Amortized Cost   Gross Unrealized Gains   Gross Unrealized Losses   Fair Value   Percent of Amortized Cost            Rating:                                                                    AAA    $ 58    $ 1    $ (1 )  $ 58      3 %  $ 27    $ -    $ (2 )  $ 25      1 %      AA      290      18      (9 )    299      13      133      1      (13 )    121      6        A      858      6      (85 )    779      39      558      17      (99 )    476      25        BBB      600      30      (85 )    545      27      787      21      (181 )    627      35        Below investment grade      385      324      (30 )    679      18      727      277      (92 )    912      33        Non-rated      -      1      -      1      -      -      1      -      1      -            Total    $ 2,191    $ 380    $ (210 )  $ 2,361      100 %  $ 2,232    $ 317    $ (387 )  $ 2,162      100 %                  Commercial Mortgage Loans   At June 30, 2011, AIG had direct commercial mortgage loan exposure of $13.3 billion.

Notwithstanding AIG's intent and ability to hold its securities which suffered severity losses until they had recovered their cost or amortized cost basis, and despite structures that indicated, at the time, that a substantial amount of the securities should have continued to perform in accordance with original terms, AIG concluded, at the time, that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary.   Determinations of other-than-temporary impairments are based on fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit losses were not recognized.   AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 related to:    •securities for which AIG has changed its intent to hold or sell;   •declines due to foreign exchange rates;   •issuer-specific credit events;   •certain structured securities; and   •other impairments, including equity securities, partnership investments, private equity investments and investments in life settlement contracts.    With respect to the issuer-specific credit events shown above, no other-than-temporary impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.05 percent and 0.12 percent of Total equity in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $111 million and  166      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  $129 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $214 million and $221 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(d)The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC. (e)Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.   For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $3.0 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads.   As of June 30, 2011, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for more than 12 months consisted of the unrealized loss of $224 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 52 securities with an amortized cost of $159 million and a net unrealized loss of $101million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate-related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive.  167                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Credit Risk Management   AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loans, finance leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (mark-to-market and potential future exposure), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties and letters of credit (in the case of financial institutions) and the specified credit equivalent exposures to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. Therefore, AIG's reported credit exposures to a counterparty reflect available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, trading securities, derivative exposures and any other counterparty credit exposures.   AIG's single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 33 percent of total equity at June 30, 2011 compared to 21 percent at December 31, 2010. The increase reflects the effects of the Recapitalization on total equity as well as increased exposure to the U.S. Government, including primarily credit exposure to the U.S. Treasury and its agencies and to the direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities (primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)). Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at both June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, AIG's largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure was 0.6 percent of total equity.   AIG's single largest industry credit exposure was to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms and insurance and reinsurance companies. As of June 30, 2011, credit exposure to this sector was $122 billion, or 131 percent of total equity compared to 117 percent at December 31, 2010. At June 30, 2011, $117 billion or 96 percent of these financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. AIG's aggregate credit exposure to fixed income securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $49 billion. Short-term deposit placements with and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $33 billion of the total exposure to global financial institutions at June 30, 2011. The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to derivatives, reinsurance recoverables and collateral extended to counterparties. Below investment grade-rated credit exposures within global financial institutions were $4 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to $5 billion at December 31, 2010. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade financial institutions was $2 billion at June 30, 2011.   Among AIG's financial institution exposures, aggregate credit exposures to European banks totaled $31 billion at June 30, 2011, with $30 billion of these credit exposures considered investment grade. Moreover, short-term placements, operating account balances and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $15 billion. Aggregate below investment grade-rated credit exposures to European banks were $658 million at June 30, 2011.   Aggregate credit exposures at June 30, 2011 to banks in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Italy and Hungary were $2.3 billion, with $2.1 billion of these exposures to mostly highly rated banks in Italy and Spain.  168      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  AIG also has a risk concentration primarily through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies in the U.S. municipal sector. AIG held $38 billion (amortized cost) of tax-exempt and taxable securities as of June 30, 2011, compared to $45 billion at December 31, 2010, issued by a wide number of municipal authorities across the U.S. and its territories, with $5 billion of these exposures pre-refunded, compared to $6 billion at December 31, 2010. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property casualty insurance companies. These securities were comprised of the general obligations of states and local governments, revenue bonds issued by these same governments and bonds issued by transportation authorities, universities, state housing finance agencies and hospital systems. The weighted average credit quality of these issuers was A, based on AIG's internal ratings. At June 30, 2011, AIG had $909 million of additional exposures to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios, compared to $985 million at December 31, 2010. This consisted of AIGFP derivatives and assets and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.   Several states, local governments and other issuers are still facing pressures on their budgets from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending, increase taxes and draw on reserve funds. Consequently, several municipal issuers in AIG's portfolios have been downgraded one or more notches by the major rating agencies. The most notable of these issuers are the State of California, of which AIG held $503 million of general obligation bonds at June 30, 2011 (compared to $748 million at December 31, 2010), $12 million of which were pre-refunded, and the State of Illinois, of which AIG held $164 million of general obligation bonds (compared to $238 million at December 31, 2010), $59 million of which were pre-refunded ($69 million at December 31, 2010). Nevertheless, despite the budget pressures facing the sector, AIG does not expect any significant defaults in its portfolio holdings of municipal issuers in the foreseeable future.   AIG has credit exposures to several European governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in recent months by one or more major rating agencies. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits and rising government debt-to-GDP ratios. As of June 30, 2011, AIG had $959 million of aggregate direct and guaranteed credit exposures to the governments of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Hungary, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010. These credit exposures included available-for-sale and trading securities and derivative exposures to these governments. Of these countries, only Portugal experienced a ratings downgrade during the second quarter of 2011. Of this exposure, $859 million was to the more highly rated governments of Spain and Italy. AIG had no direct or guaranteed credit exposures to the government of Greece.   AIG monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Nine countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at June 30, 2011 compared to eight such countries in December 31, 2010. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at June 30, 2011, six countries were rated AAA, two were rated AA, and one was rated A. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and France.   See also Investments herein for further information.   AIG's Credit Risk Management Department reviews quarterly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings. AIG Credit Risk Management periodically adjusts limits to provide reasonable assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.  169      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       Market Risk Management       Insurance and Financial Services (excluding Capital Markets) Sensitivities   The following table provides estimates of AIG's sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                    Exposure        Effect      (dollars in millions)   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010   Sensitivity Factor   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Yield sensitive assets(a)    $ 379,300    $ 403,500    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves    $ (18,600 )  $ (19,700 )    Equity and alternative investments exposure(b)    $ 44,900    $ 54,300    20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments    $ (9,000 )  $ (10,900 )    Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure(c)    $ 6,040    $ 6,200    10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar    $ (604 )  $ (620 )             (a) Excluding Nan Shan, which is held for sale, at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Yield sensitive assets were $325.1 billion and $350.7 billion, respectively. (b)Excluding Nan Shan, which is held for sale, at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Equity and Alternative Investments were $39.7 billion and $50.6 billion, respectively. (c)Excluding Nan Shan, which is held for sale, at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Total foreign exchange exposures were $4.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.   Exposures for yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short-term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures for equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIG's consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis, net of Nan Shan DAC adjustment.    •Total yield sensitive assets decreased 5.6 percent or $24.2 billion at June 30, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to the divestiture of AIG Star/Edison in the first quarter of 2011 ($41.7 billion) as well as a decline in cash and other assets of $12.8 billion. This decline was partially offset by increases in fixed income assets of $30.3 billion.   •Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 17.3 percent or $9.4 billion compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to: AIG's sale of MetLife equity securities ($6.5 billion); lower common and preferred stock holdings in Japan ($1.5 billion) due to the sale of AIG Star/Edison; and decrease in mutual fund value ($1.5 billion) and real estate investment ($0.9 billion). The decrease was partially offset by the appreciation of AIA stock ($2.6 billion).   •The $0.1 billion decrease in foreign currency exchange rates net exposure is primarily due to the divestiture of AIG Star/Edison ($2.44 billion), partially offset by increases in AIG's continuing insurance operations (up $1.3 billion) and in Nan Shan (up $1.1 billion).    The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors are the same as those used in AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  170      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries     Critical Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:    •estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax asset;   •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and flight equipment;   •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps (CDS) and AIG's economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III;   •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;   •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;   •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments; and   •liabilities for legal contingencies;    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected. Following is a discussion of updates to Critical Accounting Estimates during 2011. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, see AIG's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset:   The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.   AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets weighs the sustainability of recent operating profitability, the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, and its emergence from cumulative losses in recent years. The framework requires AIG to consider all available evidence, including:    •the sustainability of recent operating profitability of the AIG subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions;   •the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets;   •the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses in recent years;   •the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards;   •the recognition of the gains and losses on business dispositions;   •prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax assets; and   •the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences.   171      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Despite several favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the active wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios, and the sale of certain businesses, AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group has experienced cumulative losses in recent years and volatility in sustainable operating profit. Based on this evidence at June 30, 2011, AIG cannot yet overcome this significant negative evidence to assert at this time that the U.S. consolidated income tax group deferred tax asset will be realized.   However, AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group has reported financial taxable income over the first half of 2011 and is currently projecting financial taxable income for the full year 2011. Additionally, AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group expects to emerge from cumulative losses in recent years in the second half of 2011. These factors, if realized, would represent significant positive evidence. Therefore, if these factors were to be met, and based on the characteristics of the deferred tax assets, the valuation allowance could be released in large part during the fourth quarter of 2011, which would materially and favorably affect Net income and Other comprehensive income in the period. At December 31, 2010, the valuation allowance for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group was $23.8 billion.       Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs — Short Duration (general insurance):   Recoverability of DAC is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses and maintenance costs, unamortized DAC and anticipated maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Investment income is not anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded unearned premiums of its Chartis U.S. and Chartis International operating segments exceeded the sum of these costs at June 30, 2011, by 4 percent and 19 percent, respectively, and, therefore, the DAC of these reporting units was considered to be recoverable. DAC for Chartis U.S. and Chartis International amounted to $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2011.       Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:       Overview   The following table presents the fair value of fixed income and equity securities by source of value determination:                        June 30, 2011 (in billions)   Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 262      93 %    Fair value based on internal sources     19     7            Total fixed income and equity securities(b)   $ 281      100 %             (a) Includes $22.7 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.    See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information about AIG's accounting policies for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements and the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.  172      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Level 3 Assets and Liabilities    Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the three levels of observability.   At June 30, 2011, AIG classified $40.3 billion and $5.5 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 6.5 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2011. At December 31, 2010, AIG classified $36.3 billion and $6.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3. This represented 5.3 percent and 1.1 percent of the total assets and liabilities, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.   Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.   Capital Markets Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio: AIGFP wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIGFP is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, AIGFP also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class:                                                               Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss)                  Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at          Net Notional Amount    Three Months Ended June 30,    Six Months Ended June 30,          June 30, 2011(a)   December 31, 2010(a)   June 30, 2011(b)(c)   December 31, 2010(b)(c)     (in millions)   2011(c)   2010(c)   2011(c)   2010(c)            Regulatory Capital:                                                        Corporate loans    $ 2,972    $ 5,193    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -    $ -        Prime residential mortgages(d)      5,562      31,613      -      (190 )    -      (7 )    6      26        Other      1,115      1,263      7      17      1      (13 )    10      (7 )            Total      9,649      38,069      7      (173 )    1      (20 )    16      19            Arbitrage:                                                        Multi-sector CDOs(e)      6,084      6,689      3,159      3,484      (90 )    241      183      399        Corporate debt/CLOs(f)      12,820      12,269      127      171      7      (83 )    44      (90 )            Total      18,904      18,958      3,286      3,655      (83 )    158      227      309            Mezzanine tranches(d)(g)      561      2,823      (27 )    198      (12 )    23      (14 )    (48 )          Total    $ 29,114    $ 59,850    $ 3,266    $ 3,680    $ (94 )  $ 161    $ 229    $ 280               (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

In addition, AIGFP terminated the vast majority of the related mezzanine tranches and the majority of the hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. The transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair values at the time of termination and, as a result, unrealized gains and losses were realized at termination. (e)During the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, AIGFP liquidated one multi-sector super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $188 million. The primary underlying collateral components, which consisted of individual ABS CDS transactions, were sold in an auction to counterparties, including AIGFP, at their approximate fair value at the time of the liquidation. AIGFP was the winning bidder on approximately $107 million of individual ABS CDS transactions, which are reported in written single name credit default swaps as of June 30, 2011. As a result, a $121 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, AIGFP also paid $21 million to its counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, a $21 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Multi-sector CDOs also include $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (f)Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (g)Net of offsetting purchased CDS of $721 million and $1.4 billion in net notional amount at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.

AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio. As of June 30, 2011, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 1.22 years. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. However, during the second quarter of 2011, AIGFP terminated mezzanine tranches related to certain terminated super senior regulatory capital trades and made payments which approximated their fair values at the time of termination. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties was generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.   The weighted average expected maturity of the Regulatory Capital Portfolio decreased as of June 30, 2011 by approximately 1.9 years from December 31, 2010 due to the termination of two transactions that had a longer than average weighted average maturity. Because the remaining counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early, AIGFP has extended the expected maturity dates by one year, which is based on how long AIGFP believes the relevant rules under Basel I will remain effective. These counterparties in the Corporate Loan and Prime Residential Mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under Basel I rules and, thus, AIG continues to categorize them as Regulatory Capital transactions.   During the second quarter of 2011, AIGFP terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions, with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion at March 31, 2011, that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute. In addition, AIGFP terminated the vast majority of the related mezzanine tranches and the majority of the hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. These transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair value at the time of termination. Subsequent to June 30, 2011, additional hedge transactions, with a net notional amount of $427 million, were terminated at values that approximated their fair value at the time of termination. The terminations had a positive net cash flow effect on AIG due to the return of previously posted collateral.  175      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than for transactions where AIGFP believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above. Although AIGFP believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and AIGFP's expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.

(c)Delinquency information is not provided to Capital Markets for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of this transaction. However, information with respect to principal amount outstanding, defaults, recoveries, remaining term, property use, geography, interest rates, and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to Capital Markets for such referenced pools.  176      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   All of the regulatory capital CDS transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution (or its affiliates) receiving the credit protection, rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties. In the vast majority of transactions, the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the CDS, either directly or through an intermediary.   As further discussed below, AIGFP receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets. AIGFP also obtains other information, such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer. The nature of the information provided or otherwise available to AIGFP with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital CDS transaction is not consistent across all transactions. Furthermore, in all corporate loan and residential mortgage transactions, the pools are blind, meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to AIGFP. In addition, although AIGFP receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools, virtually all of the regulatory capital CDS transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude AIGFP's public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets. The originating financial institutions, calculation agents or trustees (each a Report Provider) provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below, including for those within the blind pools. While much of this information received by AIGFP cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information, it does provide a sufficient basis for AIGFP to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value.   For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans, AIGFP receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more Report Providers for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool, the principal amount outstanding and defaults. In all of these reports, AIGFP also receives information on recoveries and realized losses. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography, industry and, when not publicly rated, the counterparty's assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans.   Ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available, but AIGFP estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the Report Providers to rating agency criteria. The "Percent Non-Investment Grade" information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions, not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the CDS transactions, which is determined by the individual transaction structures. All of the remaining corporate loan transactions are written on Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) loan balances, which tend to be rated lower than loans to large, well-established enterprises. However, the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the SME loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools. In addition, the transaction structures reflect AIGFP's assessment of the loan collateral arrangements, expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss. The percentage of non-investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably. One pool containing the highest percentages of non-investment grade obligations, which include all transactions with pools having non-investment grade percentages greater than 45 percent, are all granular SME loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions. The number of loans in this pool is 6,160. This large number of SME loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool. This transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated AAA by at least two rating agencies at June 30, 2011. Two other pools, with a total net notional amount of $899 million, have non-investment grade percentages less than 45 percent, with a weighted average remaining life to maturity of 3.5 years. These pools have weighted average realized losses of 0.29 percent from inception through June 30, 2011 and have current weighted average attachment points of 28.58 percent. Approximately 5.28 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default. The percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 3.40 percent to 12.88 percent.  177      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  For regulatory capital CDS transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages, AIGFP receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing, with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool, the aggregate principal amount outstanding, defaults and realized losses. These reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions. AIGFP also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages. The stratification tables also include information on remaining term, property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions.   Delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on 82.90 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0.15 percent to 2.21 percent, averaging 0.46 percent. Except for one transaction, which comprised less than 4.50 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount, the average default rate (expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount) was 0.89 percent and the default rates ranged from 0.00 percent to 6.14 percent. The default rate on this one transaction was 22.10 percent with a subordination level of 59.48 percent.   For all regulatory capital transactions, where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools, AIGFP monitors the rating agencies' releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings, as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available. The tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital CDS transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions.   AIGFP analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and to determine any changes in credit quality with respect to such pools of assets. This analysis includes a review of changes in pool balances, subordination levels, delinquencies, realized losses and expected performance under more adverse credit conditions. Using data provided by the Report Providers and information available from rating agencies, governments and other public sources that relate to macroeconomic trends and loan performance, AIGFP is able to analyze the expected performance of the overall portfolio because of the large number of loans that comprise the collateral pools.   Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief. Further, AIGFP expects that counterparties will continue to terminate these transactions prior to their maturity.

While the super senior tranches are amortizing, subordinate  180      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  layers have not been reduced by realized losses to date. Such losses are expected to emerge in the future. At inception, substantially all of the underlying assets were rated B-/B3 or higher and in most cases at least BBB or Baa. Thus, the percentage of gross notional amount rated less than B-/B3 represents a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets.

Collateral    Most of the Capital Markets credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. Although AIGFP has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions, the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi-sector CDOs.   Regulatory Capital Relief Transactions   As of June 30, 2011, 73.5 percent of the Capital Markets regulatory capital relief transactions (measured by net notional amount) were subject to CSAs linked to AIG's credit rating and 26.5 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions. In general, each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand-alone Master Agreement or similar agreement, under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction.   The underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula. The varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties. The following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio.   Reference to Market Indices — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index, such as either iTraxx or CDX. This mechanism is used for CDS transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages. While the market index is not a direct proxy, it has the advantage of being readily obtainable.  Negotiated Amount — Under this mechanism, the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between AIGFP and the counterparty, which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by AIGFP.   182      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio (prior to consideration of transactions other than the Capital Markets super senior credit default swaps subject to the same Master Agreements) as of the periods ended:                        (in millions)   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Reference to market indices    $ 5    $ 19      Negotiated amount      -      217            Total    $ 5    $ 236              Arbitrage Portfolio — Multi-Sector CDOs   In the CDS transactions with physical settlement provisions, in respect of multi-sector CDOs, the standard CSA provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified, with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying CDO security, rather than the replacement value of the transaction. As of any date, the "market value" of the relevant CDO security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such CDO security in a market transaction on such date, while the "replacement value of the transaction" is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation (e.g., the CDO security). In cases where a formula is utilized, a transaction-specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure, which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted. These thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of AIG and/or the reference obligations, with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings. For the large majority of counterparties to these transactions, the Master Agreement and CSA cover non-CDS transactions (e.g., interest rate and cross currency swap transactions) as well as CDS transactions. As a result, the amount of collateral to be posted by AIGFP in relation to the CDS transactions will be added to or offset by the amount, if any, of the exposure AIG has to the counterparty on the non-CDS transactions.   Arbitrage Portfolio — Corporate Debt/CLOs   All of the Capital Markets corporate arbitrage-CLO transactions are subject to CSAs. These transactions are treated the same way as other transactions subject to the same Master Agreement and CSA, with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard CSA procedures outlined above.   The vast majority of corporate debt transactions, and all such transactions maturing after 2011, are no longer subject to future collateral postings. In exchange for an upfront payment to an intermediary counterparty, AIGFP has eliminated all future obligations to post collateral on corporate debt transactions that mature after 2011.   Collateral Calls   AIGFP has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps, of which a large majority relate to multi-sector CDOs. To a lesser extent, AIGFP has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage.   From time to time, valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference CDO securities, for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by AIGFP in connection with such instruments, have resulted in estimates that differ, at times significantly, from AIGFP's estimates. In almost all cases, AIGFP has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements. Due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements, AIGFP regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences. Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party  183      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries  valuation, considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                        (in millions)   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010            Regulatory capital    $ 5    $ 236      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO      2,683      3,013      Arbitrage – corporate      523      537            Total    $ 3,211    $ 3,786              The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. While a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio, a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined. AIGFP estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with its super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into AIG's liquidity planning assumptions.       Valuation Sensitivity — Arbitrage Portfolio    Multi-Sector CDOs   AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the Capital Markets super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased during 2011. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.   For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the BET model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $6.1 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at June 30, 2011, a BET value is available for $3.7 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $2.4 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $3.7 billion.   The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  184      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at June 30, 2011 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                                                                                                             Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability          Average Inputs Used at June 30, 2011         (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS Prime   RMBS Alt-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices     36 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (246 ) $ (6 ) $ (17 ) $ (103 ) $ (87 ) $ (21 ) $ (12 )                Decrease of 5 points     243     7     17     97     89     16     17            Weighted         Increase of 1 year     28     -     2     20     4     2     -        average life     6.56 years   Decrease of 1 year     (48 )   (2 )   (2 )   (36 )   (5 )   (2 )   (1 )            Recovery rates     16%   Increase of 10%     (28 )   -     (4 )   (16 )   (7 )   -     (1 )                Decrease of 10%     23     -     4     12     6     1     -            Diversity score(a)     12   Increase of 5     (11 )                                                 Decrease of 5     33                                                  Discount curve(b)     N/A   Increase of 100bps     17                                                   (a)The diversity score is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. (b)The discount curve is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. Furthermore, for this input it is not possible to disclose a weighted average input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points.   These results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption. No assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed, perhaps significantly, the ranges assumed by AIGFP for purposes of the above analysis. No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above.

No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above.   Other derivatives. Valuation models that incorporate unobservable inputs initially are calibrated to the transaction price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities, etc.). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by observable market data.  185      Table of Contents American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Item 3.

Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2011, AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  186                 Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION        Item 1.
