Some of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.  Management believes that the measures described below allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the underlying performance and trends of AIG and its business segments. Management believes they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. Reconciliations of these measures to pre-tax income or unadjusted ratios, the most directly comparable measurements derived from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), are provided when such measures are disclosed.   •  AIG Property Casualty   •  Operating income (loss): During the first quarter of 2012, AIG revised the non-GAAP measure from underwriting income (loss) to operating income (loss), which includes both underwriting income (loss) and investment income (loss), but not net realized capital gains (losses) or other income (expense). Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses;   •  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted: the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discount. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $20 million each;   •  Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted: the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.   •  AIG Life and Retirement   •  Operating income (loss): During the first quarter of 2012, AIG revised its definition of operating income (loss) to exclude changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, and changes in benefit reserves related to net realized capital gains (losses). In addition to the above items, AIG Life and Retirement also excludes net realized capital gains (losses) and the related DAC, value of business acquired (VOBA) and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization from Operating income (loss).   •  Premiums, deposits and other considerations: includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts and mutual funds.    •  Aircraft Leasing – Operating income (loss): pre-tax income (loss) excluding net realized capital gains (losses); and  •  Mortgage Guaranty – Underwriting profit (loss): income (loss) excluding net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).  Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.      EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW     This executive overview highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety, together with the 2011 Annual Report, for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the capital, liquidity, credit, operational and market risks, and the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries. Commencing in the third quarter of 2012, the Chartis segment was renamed AIG Property Casualty and the SunAmerica segment was renamed AIG Life and Retirement, although certain existing brands will continue to be used.  83      Table of Contents AIG reports its results of operations as follows:  •  AIG Property Casualty – AIG Property Casualty offers property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. Commercial insurance products for large and small businesses are primarily distributed through insurance brokers. Major lines of business include casualty, property, financial and specialty (including aerospace, environmental, surety, marine, trade credit and political risk insurance). Consumer insurance products are distributed to individual consumers or groups of consumers through insurance brokers, agents, and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Consumer insurance products include accident & health (A&H) and personal insurance. In addition, Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) in Japan offers life insurance products through Fuji Life Insurance Company (Fuji Life), which are included in A&H.  •  AIG Life and Retirement – AIG Life and Retirement offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, A&H, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. AIG Life and Retirement offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms.  •  Aircraft Leasing – AIG's commercial aircraft leasing business is conducted through ILFC, and (since the date of its acquisition by ILFC on October 7, 2011), AeroTurbine, Inc. (AeroTurbine).  •  Other Operations – AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets (GCM) operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), Direct Investment book (including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP), Retained Interests (as defined below) and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments).      Prior Period Revisions     Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the following:      Accounting for Deferred Acquisition Costs     As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG retrospectively adopted an accounting standard on January 1, 2012 that amended the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts.  The impact to AIG shareholders' equity and Net income (loss) attributable to AIG previously reported in 2011 is summarized below:                      At December 31,   (in millions)      2011            AIG shareholders' equity as previously reported   $ 104,951      Impact of adoption of new standard on AIG Shareholders' equity     (3,413 )          AIG shareholders' equity as currently reported   $ 101,538                                       (in millions)      Three Months Ended September 30, 2011      Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011            Net income attributable to AIG as previously reported   $ (4,109 ) $ (2,000 )    Impact of adoption of new standard on Net income attributable to AIG     119     1,143            Net income attributable to AIG as currently reported   $ (3,990 ) $ (857 )           84      Table of Contents     Changes in Fair Value of Derivatives     To align the presentation of changes in the fair value of derivatives with changes in the administration of AIG's derivatives portfolio, changes were made to the presentation within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Specifically, amounts attributable to derivative activity where AIGFP is an intermediary for AIG subsidiaries have been reclassified from Other income to Net realized capital gains (losses). Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.      AIG Property Casualty Segment Changes     To align financial reporting with changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, certain products previously reported in Commercial Insurance were reclassified to Consumer Insurance. These revisions did not affect the total AIG Property Casualty reportable segment results previously reported.      Financial Overview     Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to a loss of $4.3 billion in the same period of 2011. These results reflected the following:  •pre-tax income from insurance operations of $1.8 billion and $897 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively;  •an increase in fair value of AIG's interest in AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares of $527 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to a decrease in fair value of $2.3 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2011;   •an increase in fair value of AIG's interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) of $330 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012 based on the liquidation of ML III assets by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY) in the third quarter of 2012, compared to a decrease in fair value of $931 million in the three months ended September 30, 2011; and  •impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft of $98 million and $1.5 billion in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $8.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to a loss of $3.8 billion for the same period in 2011. These results reflected the following:  •pre-tax income from insurance operations of $5.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $3.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, which included catastrophe losses of $2.8 billion, largely arising from Hurricane Irene, U.S. tornadoes and the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami in Japan (the Tohoku Catastrophe);  •increases in fair value of AIG's interest in AIA ordinary shares of $1.8 billion and $268 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively;  •an increase in fair value of AIG's interest in ML III of $2.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to a decrease in fair value of $854 million in the same period of 2011;  •an increase in estimated litigation liability of approximately $742 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 based on developments in several actions;  •impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft of $228 million and $1.7 billion in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and  •a $3.3 billion charge, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the credit facility provided by the FRBNY (the FRBNY Credit Facility) in 2011.  Pre-tax income from insurance operations reflected AIG Property Casualty's continued benefit from growth in higher value lines and geographies and improving pricing trends. AIG Property Casualty is benefiting from higher interest  85      Table of Contents income on fixed maturity securities driven by the redeployment of excess cash and short-term investments into longer term investments, and its investments in higher yielding securities.  AIG Life and Retirement is benefiting from its broad portfolio of innovative products and diverse and strong distribution relationships. Results for AIG Life and Retirement in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 also benefited, in comparison, from the reinvestment of cash in 2011 and an increase in base yields. Partially offsetting AIG Life and Retirement's improvements were lower income from hedge funds and private equity investments.      Liquidity and Capital Resources     In March 2012, AIG paid down in full the $8.6 billion remaining preferred interests in the AIA special purpose vehicle (the AIA SPV, and such interests, the AIA SPV Preferred Interests) held by the Department of the Treasury.  In addition, in the first nine months of 2012 the Department of the Treasury, as selling shareholder, completed four registered public offerings of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock) in March, May, August and September (collectively, the 2012 Offerings).  The Department of the Treasury sold approximately 1.22 billion shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately $38.2 billion in the 2012 Offerings. AIG purchased approximately 421 million shares of AIG Common Stock at an average price of $30.86 per share for an aggregate purchase amount of approximately $13 billion in the 2012 Offerings. As a result of the Department of the Treasury's sale of AIG Common Stock and AIG's purchase of shares in the 2012 Offerings, ownership of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury was reduced from approximately 92 percent prior to the completion of the first registered public offering with the Department of the Treasury as selling shareholder in May 2011 to approximately 15.9 percent after the completion of the fourth 2012 offering in September 2012.  AIG expects that the Department of the Treasury will seek to further reduce its ownership interest in AIG over time through additional secondary offerings or open market sales. Depending upon market conditions, regulatory limitations, available capital resources and liquidity, and any repurchase authorization then available, AIG may determine to participate as a purchaser in such secondary offerings.  See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries herein for further discussion and other liquidity and capital resources developments.      OUTLOOK         Hurricane Sandy     On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the United States. Because of the limited information available, AIG is currently unable to estimate the amount of its losses from the hurricane.      Priorities for 2012 and Beyond     AIG remains committed to its long-term aspirational goals and is focused on the following priorities for 2012 and beyond:  •Strengthen and grow AIG's core businesses;  •Implement a strategic alternative for ILFC through an initial public offering or sale;   •Manage AIG's capital and interest expense more efficiently;  •Work with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in its capacity as AIG's principal regulator;   •Continue to build, strengthen and streamline AIG's financial and operating systems infrastructure and control environment throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations and human resources; and  •Increase AIG's competitiveness by restructuring AIG's operations consistent with its current size and plans.  86      Table of Contents     AIG Property Casualty     AIG Property Casualty expects that the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to negatively impact net investment income and limit growth in some markets through at least the next 12 months. However, improving trends in certain key indicators may offset the effect of some of these challenges. Beginning in the second quarter of 2011 and continuing since, AIG Property Casualty has observed positive pricing trends, particularly in its U.S. commercial business. AIG Property Casualty expects that expansion in certain growth economies will trend higher than in developed countries, although at reduced levels from those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions for some of these countries.     Strategy     AIG Property Casualty continues to make progress with its strategy to grow higher value and less capital-intensive lines of business, and to implement corrective actions on underperforming businesses. Management reviews each of the businesses to evaluate their contribution to overall performance objectives.  AIG Property Casualty seeks to provide value for people and businesses worldwide through the identification and efficient management of risk. In pursuing this mission and growing its intrinsic value, AIG Property Casualty has established strategic initiatives in several key areas. Initiatives in these areas are helping AIG Property Casualty direct its capital and resources to optimize financial results, while acknowledging that performance in these areas may vary from quarter to quarter depending on local market conditions, such as pricing and the effects of foreign exchange rates or changes in global capital market trends.   •  Business Mix Shift – AIG Property Casualty seeks to continue to diversify its business portfolio, while retaining the flexibility to capitalize on sustainable profit in products and geographies of opportunity. AIG Property Casualty believes that there is an opportunity to shift its current mix of business toward growth economy nations, such as China, India and Brazil, among others, and to higher value lines such as consumer business and less commoditized commercial lines.      •Commercial Insurance is effectively utilizing global underwriting and product best practices to target high value customers and geographies. AIG Property Casualty is leveraging its significant global footprint and multinational capabilities to serve large and mid-sized businesses with cross-border operations. Commercial Insurance is also expanding its presence in growth economy nations. In the Americas and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, Commercial Insurance expects to focus on the higher value lines within its portfolio and to capitalize on market opportunities.   •Consumer Insurance continues to grow its net premiums written in key markets and to expand internationally, particularly in growth economy nations. Consumer Insurance growth strategies span multiple distribution channels and include direct to consumer, agent, broker and affinity groups. In the Asia Pacific region, the 2010 acquisition of Fuji enables the continued introduction of a breadth of products across its distribution channels and customer base. In the Americas region, Consumer Insurance continues to focus its growth in niche areas, such as the high net worth market, geographic expansion in Latin America, and the implementation of a strategic group benefits partnership with American General Life Companies (American General). In the EMEA region, management expects modest growth and will continue to focus on profitable underwriting performance.    •  Underwriting Excellence – AIG Property Casualty is implementing enhanced pricing, risk selection and account management tools, and marketing analytics that it believes enable underwriters to better select and price risks. Further changes include greater actuarial involvement in product pricing and attachments, widespread utilization of pricing and predictive models, policy form changes, increased policy exclusions and fewer multi-year policies being offered. In 2011, as part of its ongoing initiatives to reduce exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines, AIG Property Casualty ceased to actively write Excess Workers' Compensation business on a stand-alone basis. Based on this decision, AIG Property Casualty includes this legacy line of business in Other.   •  Claims Best Practices – AIG Property Casualty is continuing to focus on reducing the costs associated with claims by improving the effectiveness and efficiency in servicing its customers, thus improving its loss ratio. AIG Property Casualty is placing emphasis on streamlining its claims operations, implementing effective technology and processes and the use of fraud detection tools to create a competitive advantage. Analyzing actuarial, underwriting, claims and legal data is helping AIG Property Casualty develop its knowledge of the structural drivers of losses, in order to proactively mitigate their impact on reserve development and legal costs, and improve pricing. Current accident year loss ratios have started to improve and AIG Property Casualty expects this trend to continue.  87                Table of Contents   •  Expense Discipline – To achieve expense reductions, AIG Property Casualty plans to take advantage of its global footprint to improve efficiencies and expand the use of shared services to support regional businesses in strategic locations, reduce use of external services and negotiate preferred rates with vendors. As a result of the business mix shift to consumer products, higher value commercial products, and the investment in growth economy nations, policy acquisition expenses, including direct marketing costs, are expected to continue to increase. AIG Property Casualty expects, however, that these changes will ultimately help generate business with more favorable underwriting results. AIG Property Casualty continues to make strategic investments in systems, processes and talent worldwide, which will increase expenses in the short-term, but should create additional value and greater efficiency in the future.     Capital Deployment     AIG Property Casualty expects to continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, executing underwriting strategies, enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve capital ratios, increasing return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends.  AIG Property Casualty continues to streamline its legal entity structure, to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, AIG Property Casualty has completed 30 legal entity and branch restructuring transactions. In preparation for Solvency II compliance, a number of European branch conversions have been completed, including the merger of Chartis Ireland into Chartis Europe Limited on December 1, 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, AIG Property Casualty's capital management initiatives enabled certain European subsidiaries to return $325 million of capital to be used for general corporate purposes. As a result of its legal entity simplification efforts, the majority of AIG Property Casualty's European operations will be conducted through a single pan-European insurance carrier by the end of 2012, subject to regulatory approval.     Investments     AIG Property Casualty expects to continue to refine its investment strategy, which includes asset diversification and yield-enhancement opportunities that meet AIG Property Casualty's liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  See Segment Results – AIG Property Casualty Operations – AIG Property Casualty Results - AIG Property Casualty Investing and Other Results and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.      AIG Life and Retirement     AIG Life and Retirement continues to pursue its goals of (i) expanding the breadth and depth of its distribution relationships, (ii) introducing innovative new products and product enhancements, (iii) disciplined life insurance underwriting and matching of asset and liability durations, (iv) maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and strong statutory surplus, (v) proactively managing expenses and, (vi) subject to regulatory approval, continuing to make distributions to AIG Parent. AIG Life and Retirement expects to continue to make progress on all of these efforts for the remainder of 2012 and throughout 2013.     Business Environment      •  Effect of low interest rates – AIG Life and Retirement's businesses and the life and annuity industry in general continue to be affected by the current low interest rate environment. Low interest rates can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC. Continued low interest rates also put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect future sales of interest rate-sensitive products and reduce future profits.  •  Loss recognition    •Certain long duration products, including traditional life insurance, accident and health products such as long-term care insurance and payout annuities may require increases in reserves if changes in estimates    88      Table of Contents   of future investment returns result in projected future losses. Long term care products may also require additional reserve if future expected premium increases are not sufficient to cover future benefit cost increases not provided for in the current reserves. For these long duration traditional products, the assumptions used to calculate benefit liabilities and DAC are "locked in" at policy issuance. These assumptions are based on management's estimates of mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns. If observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing, DAC is adjusted and additional policyholder benefit liabilities may be recorded through a charge to policyholder benefit expense.   •AIG Life and Retirement does not expect a DAC unlocking or an increase in reserves due to loss recognition in 2012 solely as a result of the low interest rate environment.   •In conjunction with a program to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards, AIG Life and Retirement sold approximately $14.7 billion of investments in the first nine months of 2012. These sales and other sales and subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition on certain long-term contracts in the amount of $1.1 billion, which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized to actual loss recognition and, to a much lesser extent, transferred shadow DAC to DAC amortization expense in the first nine months of 2012. In connection with this block of business, assumptions related to investment yields, mortality and expenses will be reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which may result in additional loss recognition or reserve increases. In addition, due to the reinvestment of the assets at lower yields, earnings related to this block of business are expected to decline beginning in 2013. See Results of Operations – Segment Results – AIG Life and Retirement Operations.       •  Equity market volatility – Declines in the equity markets may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features, and equity market volatility can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC. In amortizing DAC, value of new business acquired (VOBA) and sales inducement assets (SIA), AIG Life and Retirement applies a reversion to the mean methodology to short-term fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business, given inherent changes in equity market returns and interest rates. This methodology reduces the effect of short-term volatility on valuations of reserves for guarantee features and related DAC. Positive separate account returns could trigger a favorable DAC adjustment, where the mean return assumption is reset. However, no DAC adjustment is currently anticipated for 2012 solely as the result of positive market returns.  •  DAC, VOBA and SIA for Investment-Oriented Products    •For long-duration traditional business, which includes traditional life, accident and health, and certain payout annuities, policy acquisition and issuance costs are deferred and amortized, with interest, over the premium paying period. The assumptions used to calculate liabilities and DAC are "locked in" at policy issuance. If observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing, DAC is adjusted through amortization expense, and additional liabilities may be recorded, as discussed above.   •For universal life and investment-type annuity products (collectively, investment-oriented products), policy acquisition and issuance costs are deferred and amortized, with interest, based on the estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include investment spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses and mortality gains and losses. Emerging actual gross profits are used to true up the amortization of DAC, VOBA and SIA each quarter. In addition, future assumptions are reviewed to determine whether they should be modified. If so, the DAC, VOBA and SIA assets may be recalculated and adjusted to reflect the updated assumptions. AIG Life and Retirement expects to complete its comprehensive annual review of assumptions for investment-oriented products in the fourth quarter of 2012 and incorporate the results of this analysis into its estimates of future gross profits.       Organizational Realignment     On April 12, 2012, AIG Life and Retirement announced several key organizational structure and management changes intended to better serve the organization's distribution partners and customers. Key aspects of the new structure are distinct product divisions, shared annuity and life operations platforms and a unified all-channel distribution organization with access to all AIG Life and Retirement products. Beginning in 2013, AIG Life and  89      Table of Contents Retirement expects to modify its presentation of results when organizational changes are implemented and all prior periods' presentations will be conformed.  AIG Life and Retirement intends to continue its efforts to consolidate its regulated insurance companies to implement a more efficient legal entity structure, while continuing to market products and services under existing brands. At the conclusion of this legal entity consolidation initiative, AIG Life and Retirement expects to reduce the number of its operating life insurance legal entities to three. Subject to receiving all necessary regulatory approvals, these legal entity mergers are targeted to be effective as of December 31, 2012.     Variable Annuities     AIG Life and Retirement variable annuity sales increased due to access to broad distribution, including the addition of several new distributors and AIG Life and Retirement's reinstatement by its largest pre-financial crisis distribution partner, as well as its innovative product offerings. In addition, several competitors have scaled back or ceased selling variable annuity products in 2012. As a result of a broad distribution network and a more favorable competitive environment, AIG Life and Retirement expects variable annuity sales to remain strong for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.  AIG Life and Retirement has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts, caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities. AIG Life and Retirement substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets. However, due to regulatory capital considerations, a portion of AIG Life and Retirement's interest rate exposure is unhedged. In 2012, AIG Life and Retirement began purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce its interest rate risk exposure over time. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement launched a new product offering with a volatility-controlled fund, which further reduces AIG Life and Retirement's risk related to market volatility while offering a competitive benefit. The volatility-controlled fund seeks capital appreciation and current income while managing net equity exposure by investing a portion of AIG Life and Retirement's assets using a strategy designed to reduce the effects of equity market volatility.     Fixed Annuities     Changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products. As a result of the current low interest rate environment, fixed annuity sales in the first nine months of 2012 were significantly below 2011 levels. If the low interest rate environment continues, AIG Life and Retirement expects its fixed annuities sales (including deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) to remain weak for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.    Life Insurance     AIG Life and Retirement's strategic focus for mortality-based products includes disciplined underwriting, active expense management and product innovation. AIG Life and Retirement's distribution strategy is to grow new sales by strengthening the core retail independent and career agent distributor channels and expanding its market presence with competitively priced products offering superior consumer value and differentiated features. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement is enhancing its service and technology platform through the consolidation of its life operations and administrative systems, which is expected to result in an improved service delivery model and a more efficient operating platform. In connection with this project, AIG Life and Retirement recorded a charge of $20 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012.     Interest Crediting Rates     The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in AIG Life and Retirement products may have the effect, in a continued low interest rate environment, of reducing AIG Life and Retirement's spreads and thus reducing future profitability. Although AIG Life and Retirement partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.  90      Table of Contents As of September 30, 2012, the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities consisted of intermediate- and long-term fixed maturity securities. AIG Life and Retirement generally purchases assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. Opportunistic investments in structured securities continue to be made in order to improve yields, increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment.  AIG Life and Retirement's annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. AIG Life and Retirement has adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates in order to maintain targeted interest rate spreads on both new business and in-force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees.  New fixed annuity sales have declined in the first nine months of 2012 relative to the same period in 2011, due to the relatively low crediting rates offered. However, even in the current interest rate environment, AIG Life and Retirement continues to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted interest rate spreads. The annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted interest spreads.  As a result of these actions, AIG Life and Retirement estimates that the effect of interest rates remaining at or near current levels through the end of 2013 on pre-tax operating income would not be material, and would be modestly more significant with respect to 2014 results.  As indicated in the table below, approximately 61 percent of AIG Life and Retirement's annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of September 30, 2012, an increase from 45 percent at December 31, 2011. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of September 30, 2012 ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products.  In addition to the products discussed above, certain traditional long-duration products for which AIG Life and Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential losses in a prolonged low interest rate environment.  The following table presents account values by range of current minimum guaranteed interest rates and current crediting rates for AIG Life and Retirement's universal life and deferred fixed annuity products and fixed account options of variable annuity products:                               September 30, 2012      Current Crediting Rates           Contractual Minimum Guaranteed Interest Rate Account Values (in millions)      At Contractual Minimum Guarantee   1-50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   More than 50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee   Total              Universal life insurance                              1%      $ 18   $ –   $ 6   $ 24        > 1% - 2%        –     –     228     228      > 2% - 3%        138     382     1,370     1,890        > 3% - 4%        2,179     246     1,568     3,993      > 4% - 5%        4,398     193     12     4,603        > 5% - 5.5%        322     3     2     327            Subtotal      $ 7,055   $ 824   $ 3,186   $ 11,065              Fixed annuities                              1%     $ 851   $ 2,663   $ 6,185   $ 9,699        > 1% - 2%        4,714     9,104     9,387     23,205      > 2% - 3%        29,866     2,238     5,970     38,074        > 3% - 4%        12,966     1,444     485     14,895      > 4% - 5%        8,162     –     7     8,169        > 5% - 5.5%        243     –     5     248            Subtotal      $ 56,802   $ 15,449   $ 22,039   $ 94,290              Total      $ 63,857   $ 16,273   $ 25,225   $ 105,355            Percentage of total        61 %     15 %     24 %     100 %           91      Table of Contents     Aircraft Leasing     On September 2, 2011, ILFC Holdings, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, which is intended to become a holding company for ILFC, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed initial public offering. The number of shares to be offered, price range and timing for any offering have not been determined. The timing of any offering will depend on market conditions and no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any offering or that an offering will be completed.  Challenges in the global economy, including the European sovereign debt crisis, political uncertainty in the Middle East, and sustained higher fuel prices, have negatively impacted many airlines' profitability, cash flows and liquidity, and increased the probability that some airlines, including ILFC customers, will cease operations or file for bankruptcy. During the first nine months of 2012, ILFC has had nine lessees cease operations or file for bankruptcy (or its equivalent) and these lessees returned 54 aircraft to ILFC. As of October 24, 2012, 37 aircraft have been committed to new leases, 11 have been or are intended for part-out, two have been sold and four remain to be re-leased.  Most of ILFC's lessees, like much of the international airline industry, are not publicly rated and are rated internally non-investment grade by AIG. Future events, including a prolonged recession, ongoing uncertainty regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, political unrest, continued weak consumer demand, high fuel prices, or restricted availability of credit to the aviation industry could lead to the weakening or cessation of operations of additional airlines, which in turn would adversely affect ILFC's earnings and cash flows. At September 30, 2012, ILFC had signed leases for all its new aircraft deliveries in 2013 and had 82 leases in its existing fleet expiring in 2013, 36 of which had not been extended with their current lessees as of October 24, 2012. If the current lessees do not extend these leases, ILFC will have to remarket these aircraft.      Other Operations       Mortgage Guaranty     The following will continue to affect results for the remainder of 2012 and throughout 2013:  •  Market developments – UGC believes it is a market leader in the mortgage insurance industry with a differentiated risk-based pricing model producing new high quality business. The withdrawal of certain competitors from the market during 2011 combined with UGC's investment grade rating and differentiation strategy that UGC implemented in late 2010 and early 2011 has positioned UGC to take advantage of market opportunities. UGC is continuing to execute this strategy. In the first nine months of 2012, UGC increased pricing nationally by approximately 6 percent on average. UGC will continue to review its new business pricing relative to changes in the market to ensure that the price of coverage is commensurate with the level of risk being underwritten.  •  Delinquent inventory review – Beginning in the third quarter of 2011 and continuing into the third quarter of 2012, UGC requested that lenders file claims, in accordance with the terms of the respective master policies, on approximately 21,000 accounts that had been delinquent approximately 24 months or more and were not expected to be cured. Many of these delinquencies were the result of the foreclosure moratorium discussed below. Through September 30, 2012, UGC received responses to over 90 percent of these requests. While accelerating the payment of claims, these requests have resulted in coverage rescissions and claim denials at levels higher than previously experienced. UGC has considered these higher levels of rescissions and denials and the potential for higher levels of overturns in estimating its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. Over the remainder of 2012 and during the first half of 2013, UGC expects that reserve development and premium refunds associated with these claim requests will continue to impact the business. UGC continues to monitor and review the status of these requests and plans to contact lenders on an ongoing basis regarding additional delinquencies that meet these criteria. Under the terms of these master policies, if a claim is not submitted within a year of UGC's request, the lender would no longer be able to file a claim.   •  Foreclosure delays – Since 2010, a variety of servicing practices have come to light that have delayed the foreclosure process in many states. Some of these practices, such as the "robo-signing" of affidavits in judicial foreclosures, have resulted in government investigations into lenders' foreclosure practices. These developments have slowed the reporting of foreclosures, which has in turn slowed the filing of mortgage insurance claims and increased the uncertainty surrounding the determination of the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses.  92      Table of Contents UGC's assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend, although significant uncertainty remains surrounding the determination of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. UGC expects that this trend may continue for the remainder of 2012 and throughout 2013 and may negatively affect UGC's future financial results. Final resolution of these issues is uncertain and UGC cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution, individually or collectively, may have on its future results of operations or financial condition. As discussed above, UGC has requested that lenders file claims on delinquent loans before foreclosure proceedings have commenced in an effort to reduce the uncertainty surrounding these issues. UGC expects to continue this practice as long as significant delays in reporting foreclosures continue.     Global Capital Markets     GCM consists of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets), which executes the overall hedging activity for AIG and its operating companies, and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP.  AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The derivative portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives.  The remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the DIB and a portion of the legacy hedges for AIG and its subsidiaries. Future hedging needs for AIG and its subsidiaries will be executed through AIG Markets. AIGFP's derivative portfolio consists primarily of interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity derivatives. Additionally, AIGFP has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and limited risk. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.    Direct Investment Book     Matched Investment Program (MIP) assets and liabilities and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP (collectively, the Direct Investment book or DIB) are currently managed collectively on a single program basis to limit the need for additional liquidity from AIG Parent.  The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed to maximize return consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Program management is focused on managing the DIB's liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB. As part of this program management, AIG may from time to time access the capital markets, subject to market conditions. In addition, AIG may seek to buy back debt or sell assets on an opportunistic basis, subject to market conditions. The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.  As of September 30, 2012, the DIB maintains the liquidity that AIG believes is necessary to meet all of the DIB maturing liabilities, at all times, even in stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from AIG Parent.  Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB, including CDO securities purchased in the ML III auctions, are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility. Although a portion of AIG's investment in AIA ordinary shares is allocated to the DIB, the fair value gains and losses on the AIA ordinary shares will continue to be reported in Retained Interests – Changes in fair value of AIA securities.    Retained Interests     Retained Interests may continue to experience volatility due to fair value gains or losses on the AIA ordinary shares. At September 30, 2012, AIG owned approximately 14 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of AIA. A change of one Hong Kong dollar in AIA's share price would result in an approximate $210 million change in AIG's pre-tax income.  93                Table of Contents  In accordance with an agreement with the underwriters of the September 2012 sale of AIA ordinary shares, AIG may not sell or hedge the remaining AIA ordinary shares prior to December 10, 2012. After that time, AIG expects to monetize its investment in AIA ordinary shares from time to time depending on market conditions, AIG's liquidity position and opportunities for cash redeployment.

Premiums and Policy Fees     Premiums decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 primarily due to declines in Commercial Insurance, resulting from enhanced risk selection and the continued execution of strategic initiatives to improve pricing and loss ratios. These declines were partially offset by increases in Consumer Insurance, resulting from the business mix shift towards higher value lines and continued investment in the direct marketing channel. Total net premiums written at AIG Property Casualty in original currency increased approximately two percent and decreased one percent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2011.  Policy fees increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to higher variable annuity fees on separate account assets as variable account assets grew as a result of improved equity markets.     Net Investment Income     The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income:                                                                                        Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011              Fixed maturity securities, including short-term investments     $ 3,263    $ 3,024      8 %   $ 9,547    $ 8,754      9 %    Change in fair value of ML II       –      (43 )    NM       246      32      NM        Change in fair value of ML III       330      (931 )    NM       2,888      (854 )    NM      Change in fair value of AIA securities including realized gain in 2012       527      (2,315 )    NM       1,829      268      NM        Change in the fair value of MetLife securities prior to their sale       –      –      NM       –      (157 )    NM      Equity securities       53      50      6       85      84      1        Interest on mortgage and other loans       270      264      2       799      794      1      Alternative investments*       340      142      139       1,194      1,467      (19 )      Real estate       35      23      52       93      75      24      Other investments        (11     )     44      NM        (9     )     72      NM              Total investment income       4,807      258      NM       16,672      10,535      58      Investment expenses       157      130      21       436      374      17              Net investment income     $ 4,650    $ 128      NM %   $ 16,236    $ 10,161      60 %            * Includes hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships.   Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2012 was significantly higher than the same period in 2011 due to the following:  •fair value gains on AIG's ML III residual interest and its investment in AIA equity securities compared to decreases in fair value of both investments for the same period in 2011;  •higher income on fixed maturity securities as a result of opportunistic risk weighted increases in the structured securities portfolio; and  •higher income from alternative investments due to improved equity market performance.  95      Table of Contents Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased significantly from the same period of 2011, primarily due to:  •fair value gains on AIG's ML III residual interest; the FRBNY completed the liquidation of ML III assets during the third quarter of 2012 and substantially all of the sales proceeds have been distributed in accordance with the priority of payments in the transaction;  •fair value gains on AIG's investment in AIA equity securities;  •increases in the fair value of Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), which made its final distribution in the first quarter of 2012; and  •higher income from fixed maturity securities and short-term investments attributable to higher average invested balances in connection with the redeployment of cash in the first half of 2011.  The increases were partially offset by declines in alternative investment income in the first half of 2012 due to relatively weaker equity market performance in 2012 compared to 2011.

These gains were partially offset by foreign exchange losses driven by a weakening U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies in the third quarter of 2012 compared to strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the same period in 2011.  AIG recognized net realized capital gains in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to net realized capital losses in the same period in 2011 due to the following:  •significantly higher gains from sales of fixed maturity securities, due in part to the capital loss tax carryforwards program discussed above, and equity securities, which in 2012 included a $426 million gain on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P.; and   •lower foreign exchange losses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.  96      Table of Contents These gains were partially offset by derivative losses, driven primarily by spread tightening and the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies.     Aircraft Leasing Revenues and Expenses     Aircraft leasing revenue increased slightly in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase from the consolidation of AeroTurbine commencing in October 2011. This increase was partially offset by the impact of early returns of aircraft from lessees who ceased operations, lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet and the decrease in the average number of aircraft owned to 926 for the period ended September 30, 2012, compared to 934 for the period ended September 30, 2011.  ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments, and lease-related charges of $98 million and $228 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively. The third quarter charge in 2011 was primarily attributable to changes in the holding period and residual values of certain aircraft types. See Segment Results – Aircraft Leasing Operations – Aircraft Leasing Results for additional information.    Other Income and Expenses     The increase in Other income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was driven by:  •an improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, resulting primarily from gains on assets due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by losses on liabilities due to the tightening of AIG's credit spreads. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, net credit valuation adjustment gains of $323 million and $54 million, respectively, were recognized;   •an improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio resulting primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, unrealized market valuation gains of $204 million and $3 million, respectively, were recognized; and  •an improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the GCM derivative assets and liabilities resulting primarily from a tightening of counterparty credit spreads. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2012, no net credit valuation adjustment gains or losses were recognized compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $97 million in 2011.  The slight increase in Other income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was driven by:  •an improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio resulting primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio. Unrealized market valuation gains of $401 million and $232 million were recognized for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and  •an improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, resulting primarily from gains on assets due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by losses on liabilities due to the tightening of AIG's credit spreads. Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $453 million and $370 million were recognized for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  These improvements were partially offset by lower gains on real estate dispositions and losses on real estate equity investments.  Other expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 due to a decrease in losses on trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft and a reduction in expense of $117 million in 2012 resulting from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the Department of the Treasury's underwriting fees for the sale of AIG Common Stock as shares were sold at a price lower than had been estimated at the time the accrual was  97      Table of Contents established and AIG repurchased a significant amount of shares for which no payment to the underwriters was required.  Other expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 due to an increase in estimated litigation liability of approximately $742 million, partially offset by a decrease in losses on trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft, lower restructuring and pension expenses and a reduction in expense of $184 million in 2012 resulting from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the Department of the Treasury's underwriting fees for the sale of AIG Common Stock as described above.     Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred     Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 primarily as a result of lower catastrophe losses for AIG Property Casualty in 2012 compared to 2011, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Irene in the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011 and the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and earthquakes in New Zealand in the first quarter of 2011.  Policyholder benefits and claims incurred also decreased for Mortgage Guaranty in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 due to declines in newly reported delinquencies and favorable loss development in 2012 compared to unfavorable loss development in 2011.  Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in policyholder benefit expenses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 for AIG Life and Retirement due to the sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, which triggered loss recognition. See Results of Operations – Segment Results – AIG Life and Retirement for additional information.    Acquisition and Insurance Expenses     Amortization of DAC was relatively unchanged in the three month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  Amortization of DAC increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to AIG Property Casualty's continued strategy to grow the higher margin Consumer Insurance business, which carries higher acquisition costs than Commercial Insurance, and change its mix of business within Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance to more profitable lines with higher acquisition costs. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the amortization of DAC in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 for AIG Life and Retirement due to positive equity market performance.  Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to increases in compensation expense, bad debt expense, direct marketing expense and expenses related to strategic initiatives for AIG Property Casualty, as well as a result of a decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities arising from the 2010 Fuji acquisition.    Interest Expense     Interest expense increased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to new debt issuances. Interest expense decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily as a result of a net reduction in outstanding debt. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $72 million in 2011 through the date of termination, including amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of $48 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries and Liquidity and Capital Resources – Debt herein for additional information.     Loss on Extinguishment of Debt     The decline in loss on extinguishment of debt reflects the effect of the $3.3 billion charge for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility.  98                Table of Contents    Income Taxes         Interim Tax Calculation Method     AIG uses the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these cases, the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to those items is treated discretely, and is reported in the same period as the related item. For the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, the tax effects of the gains on ML II and certain dispositions, including a portion of the ordinary shares of AIA and common units of The Blackstone Group L.P., as well as certain actual gains on AIG Life and Retirement's available-for-sale securities, were treated as discrete items. Those changes in the valuation allowance which were reflected in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, were also treated as discrete items.      Interim Tax Expense (Benefit)     For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, the effective tax rates on pretax income from continuing operations were 28.3 and 14.4 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, attributable to continuing operations differ from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax-exempt interest income and investments in partnerships, adjustments to the tax bases of certain foreign aircraft leases, and a decrease in the life-insurance business capital loss carryforward valuation allowance. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.  For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, the effective tax rates on pretax loss from continuing operations were 15.6 and 31.3 percent, respectively. The tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance attributable to the anticipated inclusion of the ALICO SPV within the U.S. consolidated income tax group, tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, investments in partnerships, and effective settlements of certain uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, the entire increase in the U.S. consolidated income tax group valuation allowance was allocated to continuing operations. The amount allocated to continuing operations was net of the decrease to the valuation allowance attributable to the anticipated inclusion of the ALICO SPV within the U.S. consolidated income tax group.  See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     Discontinued Operations     Results from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 include a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion on the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison). See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.      Segment Results     AIG reports the results of its operations through three reportable segments: AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Aircraft Leasing. The Other operations category consists of businesses and items not allocated to AIG's reportable segments.  99      Table of Contents The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment.

AIG Life and Retirement – Pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily reflecting higher net investment income, the positive effect of more favorable equity market performance on DAC amortization and policyholder benefit reserves, improved net investment spreads, partially offset by policyholder benefit reserve increases related to the settlement of death claim enhancement procedures and a charge to increase GIC reserves.  Pre-tax income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily reflecting the positive effect of more favorable equity market performance on DAC amortization and policyholder benefit reserves, higher net investment income due to an increase in base yields from the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short-term investments in 2011 and decreases in losses related to equity-method investments in trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft and improvements in base net investment spreads. These items were partially offset by lower income from private equity and hedge funds, lower call and tender income and a charge to increase GIC reserves.    Aircraft Leasing – Pre-tax income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to an approximately $1.4 billion decrease in impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft, and lower losses on extinguishment of debt. This decrease was partially offset by lower lease revenue and increased costs due to early returns of aircraft by lessees who ceased operations, lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet, charges relating to reserves recorded for potential exposure under aircraft asset value guarantees and an increase in depreciation expense due to the change in depreciable lives and residual values of certain aircraft.    Other Operations – Pre-tax income in the three month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to pre-tax losses in the same period in 2011 due to fair value gains in both AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities and AIG's interest in MLIII prior to the completion of the FRBNY's auctions of ML III assets. Pre-tax income in the nine month  100      Table of Contents periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to pre-tax losses in the same period in 2011 due to fair value gains in both AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities and AIG's interest in ML III partially offset by an increase in estimated litigation liability, and a loss of extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in 2011 in connection with the transactions to recapitalize AIG.     AIG Property Casualty Highlights      •Net premiums written were relatively unchanged in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 reflecting the continued execution of management's strategic initiatives to improve pricing and loss performance. Declines in certain lines of business that did not meet internal operating objectives within Commercial Insurance were offset by an increase in Consumer Insurance net premiums written.  •The loss ratio decreased by 4.2 points and 10.1 points for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, due to a reduction in catastrophe losses, coupled with the benefit from positive pricing trends, the execution of AIG Property Casualty's strategic initiatives and an increase in reserve discount. Catastrophe losses, adjusted for reinstatement premiums, were $261 million and $669 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $574 million and $2.8 billion in the respective prior year periods. Net prior year adverse development including related premium adjustments was $145 million and $329 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to adverse development of $55 million and $35 million in the respective prior year periods.  •The expense ratio increased by 3.3 points and 4.0 points for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, as acquisition costs (primarily commissions) increased due to the change in business mix to higher value lines and increased market competition. Acquisition costs also increased due to lower ceding commissions on reinsured business as a result of Commercial Insurance restructuring its Property and Specialty reinsurance programs as part of AIG Property Casualty's decision to retain more profitable business while continuing to manage aggregate exposures. Operating expenses increased in both periods as AIG Property Casualty continues to build, strengthen and streamline its financial and operating systems infrastructure and control environment throughout the organization, particularly in financial reporting, financial operations, policy and claims administration, and human resources. In addition, AIG Property Casualty incurred higher personnel costs, as it continued to seek to attract, retain and develop its human capital and sought to better align employee performance with AIG Property Casualty and broader AIG strategic goals.  •Net investment income increased by 20 percent and 8 percent for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, due to asset diversification by reducing concentration in tax-exempt municipal instruments and increasing investments in private placement debt and structured securities, and yield-enhancement opportunities.  •AIG Property Casualty paid cash and non-cash dividends of $75 million and $1.6 billion to AIG in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. In addition, on October 19, 2012, AIG Property Casualty paid a cash dividend of $800 million to AIG.    AIG Property Casualty Operations     Commencing in the third quarter of 2012, the Chartis segment was renamed AIG Property Casualty, although certain existing brands will continue to be used.  AIG Property Casualty presents its financial information in two operating segments – Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, as well as an Other category.  Commercial Insurance provides insurance solutions for large and small businesses. Commercial lines products are distributed through a network of independent retail and wholesale brokers, branches, and through an independent agency network in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions. These products are categorized into four major lines of business:  •Casualty: Includes general liability, commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management insurance. Casualty also includes risk management and other customized structured programs for large corporate customers and multinational companies.  101      Table of Contents  •Property: Includes industrial, energy and commercial property insurance products, which cover exposures to man-made and natural disasters, including business interruption.  •Specialty: Includes environmental, political risk, trade credit, surety, marine, and aerospace insurance, and various product offerings for small-medium enterprises.  •Financial: Includes various forms of professional liability insurance, including director and officer (D&O), fidelity, employment practices, fiduciary liability, network security, kidnap and ransom, and errors and omissions insurance.  Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Consumer Insurance products are distributed through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet. Consumer Insurance products are categorized into two major lines of business:  •Accident & Health: Includes individual and group voluntary and sponsor-paid personal accidental and supplemental health products, including accidental death and disability, accidental medical reimbursement, hospital indemnity and medical excess for individuals, employees, associations and other organizations. It also includes life products as well as a broad range of travel insurance products and services for leisure and business travelers, including trip cancellation, trip interruption, lost baggage, travel assistance and concierge services.  •Personal: Includes automobile, homeowners and extended warranty insurance. It also includes insurance for high net worth individuals (offered through the Private Client Group) including umbrella, yacht and fine art, and consumer specialty products, such as identity theft and credit card protection.  Other consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including excess workers' compensation written on a stand-alone basis and asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior), certain AIG Property Casualty expenses relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, and other income (expense).  The historical AIG Property Casualty financial information has been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain products that were previously reported in the Commercial Insurance operating segment to the Consumer Insurance operating segment. This change aligns the financial reporting with the changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the business to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. These revisions did not impact the total AIG Property Casualty reportable segment results previously reported.  AIG Property Casualty distributes its products through three major geographic regions:  •Americas: Includes the United States, Canada, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda.  •Asia Pacific: Includes Japan and other Asia Pacific nations, including China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and Indonesia.  •EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa): Includes the United Kingdom,

increased net investment income due to asset diversification, from concentration in tax-exempt municipal instruments into investments in private placement debt and structured securities, and yield-enhancement opportunities, lower catastrophe losses and underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection, partially offset by higher acquisition costs as a result of the change in business mix from Commercial Insurance to Consumer Insurance. Other operating expenses increased due to the continued investment in strategic initiatives as well as higher personnel costs.    Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results  Operating income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 decreased, reflecting a decrease in allocated net investment income, primarily due to a decrease in the risk free rate, offset by an improvement in underwriting losses. Lower catastrophe losses and the effect of underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection were offset by an increase in acquisition expenses as a result of a change in business mix to higher value lines with higher acquisition costs. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2012, catastrophe losses, adjusted for reinstatement premiums were $239 million compared to $452 million in the same period in 2011. The current year quarter was also impacted by severe but non-catastrophic losses overseas. Net prior year adverse development, including related premium adjustments, was $146 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to $22 million in the prior year period.  Operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 increased, reflecting an improvement in underwriting losses due to lower catastrophe losses, the effect of rate increases and enhanced risk selection, and an increase in reserve discount of $100 million. These items were partially offset by higher acquisition costs and a decrease in the allocated net investment income due to a decrease in the risk free rate. In 2012, catastrophe losses, adjusted for reinstatement premiums, were $603 million compared to $2.2 billion in 2011 as the prior year included the impact of the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and the earthquakes in New Zealand. Acquisition costs increased primarily as a result of higher commission expense due to a decrease in loss sensitive business as AIG Property Casualty moves towards higher value lines. In 2012, net prior year adverse development, including premium adjustments, was $317 million compared to net prior year favorable development of $38 million in 2011.  See AIG Property Casualty Underwriting Ratios below for further information on prior year development.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results  Operating income in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 increased, reflecting an improvement in underwriting results and an increase in allocated net investment income. This is primarily due to the combination of lower catastrophe losses, the effect of rate increases, enhanced risk selection and portfolio management, partially offset by higher acquisition costs.  In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, expenses increased primarily as a result of a change in the mix of business to higher value lines with higher acquisition costs and increased investment in direct marketing. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 also reflected a $60 million decrease in the benefit from the amortization of VOBA liabilities recognized at the time of the Fuji acquisition compared to the same period in 2011. Catastrophe losses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 were $22 million and $66 million, respectively, compared to $122 million and $680 million during the same periods in the prior year. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, net prior year favorable development was $51 million compared to net prior year adverse development of $56 million in 2011.      AIG Property Casualty Net Premiums Written     Net premiums written are the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheet.  104      Table of Contents The following table presents AIG Property Casualty net premiums written by major line of business:                                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Commercial Insurance                                          Casualty     $ 2,195   $ 2,393      (8 )%   $ 6,728   $ 7,656      (12 )%    Property       1,063     998     7       3,481     3,333     4      Specialty       856     877     (2 )     2,707     2,708     –      Financial lines       968     911     6       2,953     2,929     1            Total net premiums written     $ 5,082   $ 5,179      (2 )%   $ 15,869   $ 16,626      (5 )%          Consumer Insurance                                          Accident & Health     $ 1,819   $ 1,762     3 %   $ 5,321   $ 5,139     4 %    Personal lines       1,811     1,717     5       5,434     5,196     5            Total net premiums written     $ 3,630   $ 3,479     4 %   $ 10,755   $ 10,335     4 %          Other       –     1     NM       3     31     (90 )          Total AIG Property Casualty net premiums written     $ 8,712   $ 8,659     1 %   $ 26,627   $ 26,992      (1 )%             Commercial Insurance Net Premiums Written  In 2012, Commercial Insurance continued to concentrate on growing higher value business. The decrease in net premiums written in each period was primarily due to enhanced risk selection, particularly in the Casualty line of business, and restructuring of loss sensitive business. This is consistent with AIG Property Casualty's business strategy to improve pricing and loss ratios and to not renew business that does not meet its internal performance or operating targets. Retentions are in line with management's expectations based on the execution of these strategic initiatives.  Casualty net premiums written decreased in both periods primarily due to the continuation of AIG Property Casualty's strategic initiatives related to improved risk selection, particularly in the Americas. The continuation of the restructuring of the loss sensitive book of business in the Americas resulted in a reduction of net premiums written of $35 million and $257 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, Casualty recognized additional premium, primarily related to the loss-sensitive business, of $52 million, compared to $153 million for the same prior year period. Further, management continued to emphasize higher value lines, while taking corrective action in lines and accounts that do not meet internal performance targets, including U.S. workers' compensation and European primary casualty.  Property net premiums written increased in both periods due to growth in energy and engineered risk and restructuring of its reinsurance program as part of AIG Property Casualty's decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure. Catastrophe exposed business retained in the Americas and Asia Pacific region also benefitted from rate increases.  Specialty net premiums written for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 decreased due to the continuation of AIG Property Casualty's strategic initiatives related to improved risk selection, particularly within products provided to small and medium enterprises, in the Americas and EMEA regions, which was partially offset by the restructuring of the aerospace reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, Specialty net premiums written were unchanged although AIG Property Casualty continues to shift its business mix towards higher value lines, particularly in aerospace.  Financial lines net premiums written for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 increased reflecting business growth in all regions. Financial lines net premiums written for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 benefited from a multi-year Errors and Omissions policy in the Americas that produced net premiums written of $148 million.  105      Table of Contents   Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written  The Consumer Insurance business continued to grow its net premiums written and build momentum through its multiple distribution channels and continuing focus on direct marketing. Consumer Insurance is well-diversified across the major lines of business and has global strategies that are executed across its regions to enhance customer relationships and business performance.  Consumer Insurance currently has direct marketing operations in over 50 countries, and management continued to emphasize the growth of this channel, which for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 accounted for approximately 15 percent of its overall net premiums written. Total global direct marketing spending outside the Americas region has increased by approximately 15 percent in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, from the same periods in 2011.  A&H net premiums written increased in both periods due to the growth of group personal accident business in the Americas and Asia Pacific, strong growth of new business sales in Fuji Life, direct marketing programs in Japan and other Asia Pacific nations and growth in individual personal accident in other Asia Pacific nations. This was partially offset by the continuing strategies to reposition U.S. direct marketing, as well as pricing and underwriting actions in Europe.  Personal lines net premiums written increased in both periods primarily due to the execution of AIG Property Casualty's strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business in non-automobile products and rate increases in Japan automobile products. Growth in non-automobile net premiums written outpaced growth in automobile net premiums written, increasing its proportion to total net premiums written, due to management's focus on diversifying the global base.    Other Net Premiums Written  Substantially all premiums reported in Other relate to excess workers' compensation written on a stand-alone basis. Premium activity reflects the effects of premium audit activity on expired policies.  106      Table of Contents The following table presents AIG Property Casualty's net premiums written by region:                                                                                            Three Months Ended September 30,              Nine Months Ended September 30,                    Percentage Change in U.S. dollars      Percentage Change in Original Currency      Percentage Change in U.S. dollars      Percentage Change in Original Currency       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Commercial Insurance:                                                      Americas     $ 3,503   $ 3,607      (3 )%    (3 )%   $ 10,548   $ 11,266      (6 )%    (6 )%    Asia Pacific       530     492     8     11       1,519     1,391     9     9      EMEA       1,049     1,080     (3 )   3       3,802     3,969     (4 )   (1 )          Total net premiums written     $ 5,082   $ 5,179      (2 )%    – %   $ 15,869   $ 16,626      (5 )%    (4 )%          Consumer Insurance:                                                      Americas     $ 1,053   $ 968     9 %   10 %   $ 3,025   $ 2,795     8 %   9 %    Asia Pacific       2,162     2,065     5     5       6,337     6,014     5     4      EMEA       415     446     (7 )   4       1,393     1,526     (9 )   (3 )          Total net premiums written     $ 3,630   $ 3,479     4 %   6 %   $ 10,755   $ 10,335     4 %   4 %          Other:                                                      Americas     $ –   $ 1     NM %    (100 )%   $ 1   $ 31      (97 )%    (97 )%    Asia Pacific       –     –     NM     NM       2     –     NM     NM            Total net premiums written     $ –   $ 1     NM %    (100 )%   $ 3   $ 31      (90 )%    (90 )%          Total AIG Property Casualty:                                                      Americas     $ 4,556   $ 4,576      – %    – %   $ 13,574   $ 14,092      (4 )%    (4 )%    Asia Pacific       2,692     2,557     5     6       7,858     7,405     6     5      EMEA       1,464     1,526     (4 )   4       5,195     5,495     (5 )   –            Total net premiums written     $ 8,712   $ 8,659     1 %   2 %   $ 26,627   $ 26,992      (1 )%    (1 )%           AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The primary currencies resulting in foreign exchange fluctuations in net premiums written are the British pound, euro and Japanese yen.  The Americas net premiums written decreased in both periods, primarily due to the restructuring of the loss sensitive Casualty book of business and specialty workers' compensation, which was slightly offset by rate increases in Commercial Insurance, particularly in the U.S. These decreases were partially offset by continued growth in Consumer Insurance, which was primarily attributable to increases to group accident, personal property, Private Client Group and warranty lines. Additional premium recognized on the loss sensitive book of business was $52 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, compared to additional premium of $153 million in the prior year period.  Asia Pacific net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 primarily due to growth in Consumer Insurance, primarily driven by group personal accident insurance, personal lines products, direct marketing and travel business in Japan. In addition, net premiums written increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 as a result of growth of personal property business in Japan. The expansion in Asia Pacific countries outside Japan also continued in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, supported by growth in individual personal accident insurance, direct marketing and personal lines products. Commercial Insurance increased in the region primarily due to organic growth in property and financial lines.  107                Table of Contents  EMEA net premiums written decreased in both periods primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2012, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the British pound and euro compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 mainly due to a reduction of reinsurance protection in the Property line of Commercial Insurance. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, the EMEA net premiums written decreased due to the continued execution of underwriting discipline, a reduction in primary casualty as it did not meet internal performance targets, and rate strengthening initiatives on new and renewal business for Commercial Insurance. Consumer Insurance is focused on re-building its direct marketing programs that it previously shared with American Life Insurance Company (ALICO).

Therefore, these ratios are not separately presented.    Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Loss Ratios  The loss ratio decreased in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in catastrophe losses incurred in both the three- and nine-month periods. The accident year loss ratio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 also benefitted from an increase in reserve discount of $100 million. The improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 reflects the continued execution of strategic initiatives, including enhanced risk selection, particularly in the Property business, and restructuring of loss sensitive Casualty business. Net prior year adverse development including related premium adjustments was $146 million and $317 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to net prior year adverse development of $22 million and net favorable development of $38 million in the respective prior year periods.  In the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, net prior year adverse development was due to the impact of claims emergence in catastrophe- and non-catastrophe-related reserves, primarily in environmental (policies written after 1987) and primary (specialty) workers' compensation business. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, net prior year adverse development was due to the impact of adverse claims emergence in non-catastrophe reserves, primarily in environmental business (policies written after 1987) and excess casualty, partially offset by additional premium of $52 million related to loss-sensitive business, and by favorable development from catastrophes of $222 million. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, net prior year adverse development was due to the impact of claims emergence in non-catastrophe reserves (primarily environmental), partially offset by additional premium of $153 million related to loss-sensitive business, and by favorable development from catastrophes of $35 million. The period over period increase in the favorable development from catastrophe-related reserves is due primarily to the unique severity of 2011 catastrophes.  See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense for further discussion of discounting of reserves and prior year development.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Loss Ratios  The Consumer Insurance loss ratio in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 decreased compared to the same period in 2011 mainly due to lower catastrophes in the Americas and Asia Pacific. The loss ratio in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 decreased compared to the same period in 2011 mainly due to lower catastrophes as the prior year period was impacted by the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and other events. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 decreased as a result of management's emphasis on continued improvement in the areas of business mix risk selection, price sophistication, and where necessary, targeted underwriting actions to meet internal performance or operating targets. Included in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, were three severe, but non-catastrophic, loss events in Japan of $24 million.  109      Table of Contents The following table presents the components of net prior year development for AIG Property Casualty:                                                                   Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Commercial Insurance                              Prior year adverse development, Net of Reinsurance     $ 212   $ 47     $ 369   $ 115      Returned (additional) premium on loss-sensitive business       (66 )   (25 )     (52 )   (153 )          Net prior year loss development     $ 146   $ 22     $ 317   $ (38 )          Consumer Insurance                              Prior year adverse (favorable) loss development, Net of Reinsurance     $ (1 ) $ 28     $ (51 ) $ 56      Returned (additional) premium on loss-sensitive business       –     –       –     –            Net prior year loss development     $ (1 ) $ 28     $ (51 ) $ 56            Other                              Prior year adverse development, Net of Reinsurance     $ –   $ 5     $ 63   $ 17      Returned (additional) premium on loss-sensitive business       –     –       –     –            Net prior year loss development     $ –   $ 5     $ 63   $ 17            Total AIG Property Casualty                              Prior year adverse development, Net of Reinsurance     $ 211   $ 80     $ 381   $ 188      Returned (additional) premium on loss-sensitive business       (66 )   (25 )     (52 )   (153 )          Net prior year loss development     $ 145   $ 55     $ 329   $ 35             The following table presents AIG Property Casualty accident year catastrophe losses by major event:                                                                                                    2012      2011       (in millions)      # of Events   Commercial Insurance   Consumer Insurance   Total   # of Events   Commercial Insurance   Consumer Insurance   Total            Three Months Ended September 30,                                                      Event:*                                                      U.S. Windstorms       1   $ 30   $ –   $ 30     –   $ –   $ –   $ –      U.S. Droughts       1     121     –     121     –     –     –     –      Hurricane Isaac       1     74     24     98     –     –     –     –      Hurricane Irene       –     –     –     –     1     305     67     372      All other events and prior period development       7     14     (2 )   12     19     178     55     233            Claims and claim expenses             239     22     261           483     122     605      Reinstatement premiums             –     –     –           (31 )   –     (31 )          Total catastrophe-related charges       10   $ 239   $ 22   $ 261     20   $ 452   $ 122   $ 574            Nine Months Ended September 30,                                                      Event:*                                                      U.S. Windstorms       8   $ 345   $ 15   $ 360     4   $ 368   $ 14   $ 382      U.S. Droughts       1     121     –     121     –     –     –     –      Hurricane Isaac       1     74     24     98     –     –     –     –      Hurricane Irene       –     –     –     –     1     305     67     372      Tohoku Catastrophe       –     –     –     –     1     726     546     1,272      New Zealand earthquakes       –     –     –     –     2     300     6     306      All other events and prior period development       3     63     27     90     13     439     47     486            Claims and claim expenses             603     66     669           2,138     680     2,818      Reinstatement premiums             –     –     –           22     –     22            Total catastrophe-related charges       13   $ 603   $ 66   $ 669     21   $ 2,160   $ 680   $ 2,840              * Events shown in the above table are catastrophic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $20 million each.   110      Table of Contents   Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Expense Ratios  The expense ratio increased by 3.5 points and 4.8 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs related to AIG Property Casualty's strategy of growing higher value lines, which typically incur higher commission rates. In addition, ceding commissions decreased as a result of restructuring of the Property reinsurance program as part of the strategic decision to retain more profitable business while continuing to manage aggregate exposures. Acquisition expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 increased the expense ratio by approximately 2.6 points and approximately 3.0 points, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Further, increases in bad debt expense of approximately $27 million and $146 million contributed approximately 0.6 points and 0.9 points to the expense ratio increase in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. The remainder of the expense ratio increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Expense Ratios  The expense ratio in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 increased by 1.8 points and 1.4 points, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a change in business mix and increases in direct marketing spending. The acquisition expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 increased the expense ratio by approximately 1.9 points from the same period in the prior year, reflecting the change in business mix and an increase in direct marketing spending. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, the expense ratio increase was primarily due to operating expenses incurred to grow key lines of business across a number of geographic areas and a $60 million decrease in VOBA benefit compared to the same period in the prior year.    AIG Property Casualty Quarterly and Year-to-Date Expense Ratios  AIG Property Casualty also continued to invest in a number of strategic initiatives during 2012, including the implementation of global finance and information systems, preparation for Solvency II compliance, readiness for regulation by the FRB under Dodd-Frank, legal entity restructuring, and underwriting and claims initiatives. The costs of these initiatives are reported as part of Other. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, such investments totaled $59 million and $167 million, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $23 million and $84 million over the same periods in the prior year. AIG Property Casualty incurred higher personnel costs, as it continued efforts to attract, retain and develop its human capital and to better align employee performance with its strategic goals. These items collectively contributed approximately 0.6 points and 1.2 points to the expense ratio increase in the respective periods.

Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as Other. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments.  111                Table of Contents  Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to Other.  Net realized capital gains (losses) and Other income (expense) – net are not allocated to Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, but are reported as part of Other.    Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Investment Income  AIG Property Casualty continued to refine its investment strategy, which includes asset diversification by reducing the concentration of its portfolio in tax-exempt municipal instruments and increasing investments in private placement debt and structured securities, and yield-enhancement opportunities, by redeploying excess cash and short-term investments into longer term investments. In addition, net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 increased due to the strategic partnership with American General, all of which is reported in Consumer Insurance, and higher dividend income. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, the average yield increased by 60 and 20 basis points to 3.9 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. Net investment income increased in both periods due to higher interest income on fixed maturity securities driven by the refinement in the investment strategy. This was offset by decreases in returns on partnership and hedge fund investments, reflective of the overall lower market performance for the respective periods.    Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities in the amount of $169 million and a gain on the sale of real estate. This was partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment of $31 million, primarily attributable to publicly traded and privately-held equity securities in the Japan portfolios and a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities. In addition, impairment charges of approximately $59 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period.  Net realized capital gains for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity securities in the amount of $490 million, which were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $330 million, primarily attributable to a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities, and partnership investments and equity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. In addition, impairment charges of $174 million primarily related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period.      Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense     The following discussion of the consolidated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses (loss reserves) presents loss reserves for AIG Property Casualty as well as the loss reserves pertaining to the Mortgage Guaranty reporting unit, which is reported in Other.  112      Table of Contents The following table presents the components of AIG's gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a U.S. statutory basis*:                                          (in millions)     September 30, 2012      December 31, 2011            Other liability occurrence     $ 21,698   $ 22,471      International       17,795     17,726      Workers' compensation (net of discount)       17,483     17,420      Other liability claims made       11,597     11,216      Property       3,775     6,165      Auto liability       2,987     3,081      Products liability       2,197     2,416      Medical malpractice       1,683     1,690      Mortgage guaranty/credit       2,101     3,101      Accident and health       1,521     1,553      Commercial multiple peril       1,310     1,134      Aircraft       1,061     1,020      Fidelity/surety       618     786      Other       1,587     1,366            Total     $ 87,413   $ 91,145             * Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  AIG's gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. The methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting from this review are currently reflected in pre-tax income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.  The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance, less applicable discount for future investment income.  The following table classifies the components of net loss reserves by business unit:                                          (in millions)     September 30, 2012     December 31, 2011            AIG Property Casualty:                  Commercial Insurance     $ 56,481   $ 58,549      Consumer Insurance       5,485     5,438      Other       4,170     3,992            Total AIG Property Casualty       66,136     67,979            Other operations – Mortgage Guaranty       1,951     2,846            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period     $ 68,087   $ 70,825               Discounting of Reserves  At September 30, 2012, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.3 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations.  The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979 - 81 Decennial Mortality Table.  113      Table of Contents The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies. Certain other asbestos business that was written by AIG Property Casualty is discounted based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business. The discount consists of the following: $777 million – tabular discount for workers' compensation in the U.S. operations of AIG Property Casualty; $2.4 billion – non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in the U.S. operations of AIG Property Casualty; and $57 million – non-tabular discount for asbestos for AIG Property Casualty.  The following table presents the change in reserve discount:                                                                Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Change in loss reserve – current accident year     $ 85   $ 82     $ 255   $ 244      Change in loss reserve – prior year development       –     –       87     (27 )    Accretion of reserve discount        (91  )    (89 )      (273  )    (267 )          Net increase (decrease) in reserve discount      $  (6  )  $ (7 )    $  69    $ (50 )           The benefit from the change in discount in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 includes a $100 million increase in the reserve discount due to the commutation of an internal reinsurance treaty, under which a U.S. subsidiary previously ceded workers' compensation claims to a non-U.S. subsidiary. AIG discounts its loss reserves related to workers' compensation business written by its U.S.-domiciled subsidiaries as permitted by the domiciliary statutory regulatory authorities. As a result of the commutation, the reserves for these claims are now being discounted commencing in the three-month period ended June 30, 2012. The commutation was implemented as part of AIG Property Casualty's efforts to simplify its internal reinsurance arrangements.  The prior year development and changes in the estimates in the payout patterns of previously established loss reserves did not have a significant impact on the change in discount in any of the periods presented.    Quarterly Reserving Process  AIG believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of September 30, 2012. While AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of September 30, 2012. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, management examines the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. AIG conducted reserve analyses in 2012 to determine the loss development from prior accident years. As part of its reserving process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues, such as those related to changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, changes in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services), underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling practices.  114      Table of Contents The following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves:                                                                Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of period     $ 68,365   $ 73,567     $ 70,825   $ 71,507      Foreign exchange effect       316     (94 )     950     617      Change due to NICO reinsurance transaction       21     –       38     –      Losses and loss expenses incurred:                              Current year, undiscounted       6,081     6,844       18,020     21,209      Prior years, undiscounted       167     130       278     221      Change in discount        5      7        (69  )    50            Losses and loss expenses incurred       6,253     6,981       18,229     21,480            Losses and loss expenses paid       6,868     6,753       21,955     19,903            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period     $ 68,087   $ 73,701     $ 68,087   $ 73,701             The following tables summarize development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years, net of reinsurance:                                                                Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Prior Accident Year Development by business unit:                              AIG Property Casualty:                              Commercial Insurance     $ 212   $ 47     $ 369   $ 115      Consumer Insurance        (1  )    28        (51  )    56      Other       –     5       63     17            Total AIG Property Casualty       211     80       381     188      Other operations – Mortgage Guaranty        (44  )    50        (103  )    33            Total     $ 167   $ 130     $ 278   $ 221                                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Prior Accident Year Development by Major Class of Business:                              Excess casualty      $  (12  )  $ (115 )    $  117    $ (177 )    D&O and related management liability        (20  )    (59 )      (22  )    (95 )    Environmental       77     133       326     218      Primary (specialty) workers' compensation       42     15       45     32      Asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior)       –     5       75     17      Commercial risk       24     45       28     115      Natural catastrophes        13      16        (241  )    (35 )    All other, net       87     40       53     113            Total AIG Property Casualty       211     80       381     188            Other operations – Mortgage Guaranty        (44  )    50        (103  )    33            Total     $ 167   $ 130     $ 278   $ 221             115      Table of Contents                                                                 Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Prior Accident Year Development by Accident Year:                              Accident Year                              2011      $  64             $  (260  )           2010        14    $ 116        (61  )  $ 102      2009        (34  )    112        (17  )    143      2008        (4  )    (41 )      (31  )    (65 )    2007        (6  )    (101 )      12      (29 )    2006        (33  )    (87 )      (40  )    (247 )    2005        59      (31 )      117      (106 )    2004        16      (20 )      1      (53 )    2003        34      23        87      37      2002 and prior        57      159        470      439            Total      $  167    $ 130      $  278    $ 221               Quarterly and Year-to-Date Prior Accident Year Development  As noted in the prior accident year development by major class of business table above, AIG Property Casualty experienced adverse development in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 in AIG Property Casualty's environmental business (policies written after 1987), primary workers' compensation lines, and primary casualty, which is included in All other, net. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, the adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in the AIG Property Casualty's environmental business (policies written after 1987), legacy environmental exposures (1986 and prior), and excess casualty lines. This was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves for natural catastrophes (principally the Tohoku Catastrophe) and favorable development in the Consumer Insurance operating segment, which is included in All other, net.  The development in the environmental business for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 was primarily attributable to claims increases in four major categories:  •Site liability coverage for known remediation projects and increased clean-up costs;   •Fixed facility coverage for manufacturers and distributors whose raw materials, products or industrial processes present a significant environmental exposure;  •Policies that provide an enhanced general liability product designed specifically to meet the needs of environmental consultants and contractors; and •A Surety policy that provided performance bonding for the remediation and closure of a landfill site.  The reserve increase in the environmental business was the result of an on-going review of certain cases that AIG believes to be subject to the most volatility. For several of those cases, AIG concluded that the reserves should be increased to take into account the updated assessment of the claims. AIG also reviewed the legacy environmental (1986 and prior) claims and increased the reserves accordingly.  Partially offsetting the prior accident year adverse development, AIG Property Casualty recognized additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $66 million and $52 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $25 million and $ 153 million in the same periods in the prior year, respectively.  See AIG Property Casualty Results herein and Other Operations – Other Operations Results – Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.  116      Table of Contents   Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and Prior) Reserves  The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  As described more fully in the 2011 Annual Report, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis performed annually. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, $32 million of net incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount is reflected in the table below. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, AIG increased its gross environmental reserves by $150 million and increased its net environmental reserves by $75 million. This development is primarily attributable to several large accounts which led to an increase in the estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported.  In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, AIG Property Casualty also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $142 million gross and $115 million net reserves as of September 30, 2012. Similar amounts were held at December 31, 2011.  117      Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:                                                           Nine Months Ended September 30,     2012      2011       (in millions)      Gross      Net      Gross      Net            Asbestos:                              Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year     $ 5,226     $ 537   $ 5,526    $ 2,223      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                              Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts       –       74     –      93      Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts(a)       –       (20  )    –      (1,789 )          Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance       –       54     –      (1,696 )          Loss and loss expenses incurred                              Change in discount       69       32     117      50            Losses and loss expenses incurred(b)       69       32     117      50            Losses and loss expenses paid(b)        (289  )      (180  )    (375 )    (181 )    Other changes       –       –     –      168            Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period     $ 5,006     $ 443   $ 5,268    $ 564            Environmental:                              Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year     $ 204     $ 119   $ 240    $ 127            Losses and loss expenses incurred       150       75     32      17            Losses and loss expenses paid        (31  )      (21  )    (64 )    (33 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period     $ 323     $ 173   $ 208    $ 111            Combined:                              Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year     $ 5,430     $ 656   $ 5,766    $ 2,350      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                              Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts       –       74     –      93      Re-estimation of amount recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts        –        (20  )    –      (1,789 )          Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance       –       54     –      (1,696 )          Losses and loss expenses incurred                              Undiscounted       150       75     32      17      Change in discount       69       32     117      50            Losses and loss expenses incurred       219       107     149      67            Losses and loss expenses paid        (320  )      (201  )    (439 )    (214 )    Other changes       –       –     –      168            Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period     $ 5,329     $ 616   $ 5,476    $ 675              (a) Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts includes effect of changes in reserve estimates and changes in discount.

All of these accounts were fully reserved at the account level and included adequate reserves for those underlying individual claims that contributed to the actual losses. These individual claim closings, therefore, had no impact on AIG Property Casualty's environmental reserves.  (b) Represents an administrative change to the method of determining the number of open claims, which had no effect on carried reserves.     Survival Ratios – Asbestos and Environmental  The following table presents AIG's survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at September 30, 2012 and 2011. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments.  Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio. Moreover, as discussed above, the primary basis for AIG's determination of its reserves is not survival ratios, but instead the ground-up and top-down analyses. Thus, caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio.  The following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims which were based upon a three-year average payment:                                                                2012      2011       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Gross      Net*      Gross      Net*            Survival ratios:                              Asbestos       9.7       8.9     8.9      10.0      Environmental       4.8       4.6     2.9      2.7      Combined       9.2       8.3     8.3      8.9              * Survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis on historical reserve excluding the effects of the NICO reinsurance transaction.   119                Table of Contents    AIG Life and Retirement Highlights     The results of AIG Life and Retirement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 reflected the following:  •Net investment income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 increased compared to the same period in 2011, due in large part to reinvestment during 2011 of significant amounts of cash and short term investments.  •Private equity and hedge fund investment income increased $81 million and decreased $189 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, compared to the respective periods of 2011.  •Investment income from the ML II investment prior to its liquidation and distribution in March 2012 increased $43 million and $214 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.   •Prudent spread management, through crediting rate changes, resulted in improvements in base net investment spreads for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012.  •The effect of more favorable equity market performance had a positive effect on policyholder benefits and DAC amortization expenses for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012.  •Reserve increases in the three months ended September 30, 2012 related to the resolution of death claims enhancement practices in connection with the multi-state examinations. •Higher net realized capital gains from the sale of investments were reflected in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012. The sales of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products, and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition charges in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012.

  •an $88 million increase in fair value gains on trading securities, including securities purchased through the FRBNY's auction of ML III assets;  •The effect of favorable market performance compared to assumptions was approximately $173 million lower DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period of 2011 for certain guaranteed benefits features of variable annuities;   •$11 million in losses related to equity-method investments in trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft compared to $97 million loss in the same period in 2011; and •a $43 million fair value loss on ML II in 2011.  The favorable variances above were partially offset by the following:  In the three months ended September 30, 2012, AIG Life and Retirement life insurance subsidiaries worked to resolve multi-state examinations relating to the handling of unclaimed property and the use of the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) to identify death claims that have not been submitted to AIG in the normal course of business.  The final settlement of these examinations was announced on October 22, 2012. AIG Life and Retirement is now taking enhanced measures to, among other things, routinely match policyholder records with the SSDMF to determine if its insured parties, annuitants, or retained account holders have died and locate beneficiaries when a claim is payable.  Expenses incurred in the current quarter related to claims enhancement include the following:  •an $11 million regulatory assessment which will be paid to the various state insurance departments that are parties to the regulatory settlement to defray costs of their examinations and monitoring; and •a $55 million increase to policyholder benefit reserves related to these audits for interest and expected acceleration of benefit payments under the settlement, including early payment or escheatment of policy proceeds under certain older industrial life policies.  Further, as a result of a comprehensive review of reserves for the GIC portfolio, AIG Life and Retirement recorded an increase to interest credited expense of $110 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012.  Pre-tax income for AIG Life and Retirement in the third quarter of 2012 included a $632 million increase in net realized capital gains compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to higher gains from a sale of investments and a $295 million decline in other-than-temporary impairments.  As part of a program to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards, certain assets in an unrealized gain position that support payout annuity products were sold. Subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition of $598 million in the three months ended September 30 2012, which was reported as a component of Change in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital losses. This charge effectively transferred shadow loss recognition to actual loss recognition in the three months ended September 30, 2012, and to a much lesser extent, resulted in additional DAC amortization. Additional sales of such securities that would result in capital gains are planned during the remainder of 2012.    Year-to-Date AIG Life and Retirement Results  Net investment income increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, reflecting an increase in base yields of 15 basis points, due to the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011. In addition to the increase from reinvestment, net investment income compared to the same period of 2011 reflected the following items:  •$214 million increase in fair value gains on ML II in 2011;  122      Table of Contents  •$94 million increase in fair value gains on trading securities; and •$112 million decrease in losses related to equity-method investments in trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft.  These items were partially offset by:  •$189 million decrease in income from private equity funds and hedge funds; and •$94 million decrease in call and tender income.  The increase in net investment income combined with lower interest credited resulted in improved investment spreads for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.  The effect of positive equity market performance resulted in approximately $210 million lower DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  The nine months ended September 30, 2012, included the previously described charges related to the multi-state examination and use of the SSDMF of approximately $66 million, compared to a change to increase IBNR related to the SSDMF of $100 million in the same period in 2011.  Also included in the nine month results was the $110 million increase in GIC interest credited expense discussed above.  As a result of decreases in interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities during the first nine months of 2012, the fair value of the U.S. Treasury securities used for hedging, net of financing costs, increased by $48 million. This was partially offset by embedded derivative losses related to the decline in interest rates, which are reported in net realized gains (losses).  Pre-tax income for AIG Life and Retirement included a $621 million increase in net realized capital gains compared to the 2011 period, due to higher gains from the sale of investments and lower other-than-temporary impairments. These higher gains were partially offset by $421 million higher fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges and other interest and currency rate swaps, which were primarily due to declining credit spreads and declines in long-term interest rates.  The sale of securities in an unrealized gain position and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields, triggered loss recognition for certain payout annuity products in the amount of $1.1 billion in 2012, which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized to actual loss recognition and, to a lesser extent, resulted in additional DAC amortization in the first nine months of 2012.    Premiums  Premiums represent premiums received on traditional life insurance policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums, deposits and other considerations is a non-GAAP measure which includes life insurance premiums, deposits on annuity contracts and mutual funds.  The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums, deposits and other considerations to premiums:                                                                Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Premiums, deposits and other considerations     $ 4,785    $ 5,878     $ 15,779    $ 18,510      Deposits       (4,111 )    (5,165 )     (13,542 )    (16,259 )    Other       (99 )    (122 )     (435 )    (377 )          Premiums     $ 575    $ 591     $ 1,802    $ 1,874             123                Table of Contents    Sales and Deposits  The following tables summarize AIG Life and Retirement premiums, deposits and other considerations by product*:                                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Premiums, deposits and other considerations Individual fixed annuity deposits     $ 174    $ 1,333      (87 )%   $ 1,254    $ 5,502      (77 )%    Group retirement product deposits       1,623      1,982      (18 )     5,205      5,389      (3 )    Life insurance       1,212      1,224      (1 )     3,838      3,914      (2 )    Individual variable annuity deposits       1,023      800      28       3,330      2,391      39      Retail mutual funds       740      522      42       2,108      1,261      67      Individual annuities runoff       13      17      (24 )     44      53      (17 )          Total premiums, deposits and other considerations     $ 4,785    $ 5,878      (19 )%   $ 15,779    $ 18,510      (15 )%          Life Insurance Sales                                          Retail – Independent     $ 34    $ 37      (8 )%   $ 103    $ 105      (2 )%    Retail – Affiliated (Career and Matrix Direct)       26      25      4       83      77      8            Total Retail       60      62      (3 )     186      182      2      Institutional – Independent       8      3      167       22      9      144            Total life insurance sales     $ 68    $ 65      5 %   $ 208    $ 191      9 %            * Life insurance sales include periodic premiums from new business expected to be collected over a one-year period and 10 percent of single premiums and unscheduled deposits from new and existing policyholders. Annuity sales represent deposits from new and existing customers.   Total premiums, deposits and other considerations decreased in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 as substantial decreases in individual fixed annuities were only partially offset by significant increases in individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds.  Individual fixed annuity deposits declined due to the low interest rate environment as consumers are reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively low crediting rates currently offered. Group retirement product deposits (which include deposits into mutual funds and fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets) decreased modestly due to slightly lower levels of individual rollover deposits and periodic deposits in 2012, partially offset by higher mutual fund deposits. The low interest rate environment has also begun to impact group retirement deposits, resulting in lower levels of deposits into fixed options. Individual variable annuity deposits increased due to innovative product enhancements and expanded distribution as well as a more favorable competitive environment. Premiums from life insurance products increased in 2012, but were more than offset by declines in deferred annuities sold through life insurance distribution channels. Retail mutual fund sales growth was principally driven by SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.'s Focused Dividend Strategy product offering which continues as a top short- and long-term performer within its respective peer group.  AIG Life and Retirement's total life sales increased nine percent during the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due in part to the timing of large institutional product sales. Sales of AIG Life and Retirement term products through its affiliated Matrix Direct channel in the first nine months of 2012 were up due in part to the shift toward selling proprietary products. Universal life sales continued to be pressured by the economic environment as the pricing of these products is sensitive to interest rates.  124      Table of Contents   Retirement Services Net Flows

of Contents Overall, net flows were negative in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to lower fixed annuity deposits resulting from the low interest rate environment. However, surrender rates for individual fixed annuities also decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 due to the relative competitiveness of interest credited rates on the existing block of fixed annuities versus interest rates on alternative investment options available in the marketplace. Net flows improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 for individual variable annuities due to both the increase in deposits and favorable surrender experience. Net flows improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 for retail mutual funds due to increased deposits.  The following table presents reserves by surrender charge category and surrender rates:                                                                                   2012      2011       At September 30,    (in millions)      Group Retirement Products*      Individual Fixed Annuities      Individual Variable Annuities      Group Retirement Products*      Individual Fixed Annuities      Individual Variable Annuities            No surrender charge     $ 55,739    $ 20,007    $ 11,609    $ 51,798    $ 17,010    $ 9,333      0% - 2%       1,285      3,304      4,282      1,007      2,981      4,147      Greater than 2% - 4%       1,296      3,537      2,256      1,189      4,893      1,785      Greater than 4%       4,779      20,813      9,351      3,226      23,578      7,440      Non-surrenderable       1,310      3,765      929      872      3,086      1,012            Total reserves     $ 64,409    $ 51,426    $ 28,427    $ 58,092    $ 51,548    $ 23,717            Surrender rates       8.0 %     6.5 %     10.3 %    8.4 %    6.9 %    12.9 %            * Excludes mutual funds of $11.3 billion and $8.6 billion at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  (b) Net of benefit of DAC and VOBA related to net realized capital losses.   As AIG Life and Retirement operates in various markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC and VOBA are subject to differing market returns and interest yield assumptions in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products.  DAC and VOBA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. See Note 2(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report for additional information on DAC and VOBA recoverability.  126      Table of Contents    Aircraft Leasing Operations     AIG's Aircraft Leasing operations are the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines, and (since the date of its acquisition by ILFC) AeroTurbine. Aircraft Leasing operations also include gains and losses that result from the remarketing of commercial jet aircraft for ILFC's own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and other aircraft fleet owners.

This increase was partially offset by lower lease revenue and increased costs due to early returns of aircraft by lessees who ceased operations, lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet, charges relating to reserves recorded for potential exposure under aircraft asset value guarantees and an increase in depreciation expense due to the change in depreciable lives and residual values of certain aircraft.  The impairment charges in 2011 resulted from unfavorable trends affecting the residual values of certain aircraft types. In monitoring the aircraft in ILFC's fleet for impairment charges on an on-going basis, ILFC considers facts and circumstances such as projected lease rates and terms, residual values, overhaul rental realization and aircraft holding periods. These items are considered in determining whether ILFC would need to modify its assumptions used in its recoverability assessments. In addition to these factors, ILFC considered its newly acquired end-of-life management capabilities from its acquisition of AeroTurbine and its impact on ILFC's strategy, as well as potential sales. While ILFC's overall business model has not changed, its expectation of how it may manage out-of-production aircraft, or aircraft that have been affected by new technology developments, changed due to the AeroTurbine acquisition. The result of the overall assessment in 2011 based on ILFC's updated assumptions and management's change in its end-of-life strategy for older generation aircraft indicated that the book value of certain aircraft were not fully recoverable and these aircraft were deemed impaired. The aircraft impaired were primarily out-of-production aircraft, or aircraft that have been impacted by new technology developments.  127      Table of Contents   Year-to-Date Aircraft Leasing Results  Aircraft Leasing reported pre-tax income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, compared to pre-tax loss in the same period in 2011 due to lower impairment charges and lower losses on extinguishment of debt. These items were offset by lower lease revenue and increased costs due to early returns of aircraft by lessees who ceased operations, lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet, charges relating to reserves recorded for potential exposure under aircraft asset value guarantees and an increase in depreciation expense due to the change in depreciable lives and residual values of certain aircraft.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, Aircraft Leasing recorded $98 million in impairment charges, fair value adjustments, and lease-related charges compared to $1.5 billion in the same period in 2011 due to the unfavorable trends in 2011 described above.     Other Operations     AIG's Other operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations, GCM operations, Direct Investment book (DIB), Retained Interests and Corporate & Other operations (after allocations to AIG's business segments) as presented below.   •Mortgage Guaranty – UGC subsidiaries issue residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one-to four-family residences.   •Global Capital Markets – consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. The remaining portfolio of AIGFP continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.   •Direct Investment book – includes results for the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.  •Retained Interests – includes fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA ordinary shares, prior to their sale, the retained interest in ML III, and, prior to their sale on March 8, 2011, the MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) securities that were received as consideration from the sale of ALICO.  •Corporate & Other – consists primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate-level net realized capital gains and losses, and certain litigation-related charges and credits.  128      Table of Contents     Other Operations Results     The following table presents pre-tax income for AIG's Other operations:                                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Mortgage Guaranty     $ 6    $ (82 )    NM %   $ 62    $ (68 )    NM %    Global Capital Markets       190      (187 )    NM       253      (66 )    NM      Direct Investment book        406      103      294       1,139      586      94      Retained interests:                                          Change in fair value of AIA securities, including realized gain in 2012        527      (2,315 )    NM       1,829      268      NM      Change in fair value of ML III       330      (931 )    NM       2,888      (854 )    NM      Change in the fair value of the MetLife securities prior to their sale       –      –      NM       –      (157 )    NM            Corporate & Other:                                          Interest expense on FRBNY Credit Facility       –      –      NM       –      (72 )    NM      Other interest expense       (416 )    (406 )    (2 )     (1,189 )    (1,319 )    10      Corporate expenses, net        (176 )    (449 )    61       (1,307 )    (708 )    (85 )    Real estate and other non-core businesses       (40 )    22      NM       (117 )    79      NM      Loss on extinguishment of debt        –      –      NM       (9 )    (3,331 )    100      Net realized capital gains (losses)       66      312      (79 )     (34 )    (111 )    69      Net loss on sale of divested businesses       –      (2 )    NM       (3 )    (76 )    96            Total Corporate & Other       (566 )    (523 )    (8 )     (2,659 )    (5,538 )    52            Consolidation and eliminations       (2 )    (10 )    80       (1 )    (26 )    96            Total Other operations     $ 891    $ (3,945 )    NM %   $ 3,511    $ (5,855 )    NM %             Mortgage Guaranty  The following table presents pre-tax income for Mortgage Guaranty:                                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Underwriting results:                                          Net premiums written     $ 219    $ 206      6 %   $ 622    $ 601      3 %    Increase in unearned premiums       (42 )    (9 )    (367 )     (97 )    10      NM            Net premiums earned       177      197      (10 )     525      611      (14 )    Claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred       163      279      (42 )     434      655      (34 )    Underwriting expenses       49      49      –       146      129      13            Underwriting loss       (35 )    (131 )    73       (55 )    (173 )    68            Investing and other results:                                          Net investment income       38      33      15       109      101      8      Net realized capital gains       3      16      (81 )     8      4      100            Pre-tax income (loss)     $ 6    $ (82 )    NM %   $ 62    $ (68 )    NM %           129                Table of Contents    Quarterly Mortgage Guaranty Results  Mortgage Guaranty reported pre-tax income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to pre-tax loss in the same period in 2011 primarily due to:  •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $116 million, reflecting lower claims and claims adjustment expenses in the first- and second-lien businesses of $69 million and $50 million, respectively. Claims and claims adjustment expenses included favorable prior year loss development of $44 million, which consists of $8 million for first-liens, $9 million for second-liens, $9 million for student loans and $18 million for the international business. This favorable prior year development was offset by current accident period losses attributable to business written in 2008 and prior;      •the first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses decrease was due to a 23 percent decline in newly reported delinquencies and favorable prior year loss development of $8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to an unfavorable development of $55 million during the same period in 2011. The favorable development of $8 million included $41 million of favorable development arising from the claims requests sent to lenders mentioned above in Outlook – Other Operations – Mortgage Guaranty, offset by $33 million of unfavorable development on delinquencies for which claim requests were not made; and   •the second-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses decline reflects $9 million of favorable loss development during the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to unfavorable development of $9 million during the same period in 2011 due to decreasing newly reported delinquencies as additional policies reach respective stop-loss limits and a $22 million reserve increase in the second quarter of 2011 in connection with an adverse judgment on previously rescinded losses.    •the commutation of 90 percent of UGC's international business in the United Kingdom during the three months ended September 30, 2012, which resulted in an underwriting gain of $3 million and in a reduction in reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses of $97 million, or 40 percent, of International reserves.  These items were partially offset by:  •a decline in earned premiums on second-lien and international businesses, both of which were placed into runoff during 2008, of $13 million and $3 million respectively; and  •a decline in realized investment gains of $13 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012.     Year-to-Date Mortgage Guaranty Results  Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax results improved in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to:  •a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $221 million, reflecting decreases in first and second-lien businesses of $189 million and $89 million, respectively, which were partially offset by an increase in international claims and claims adjustment expenses of $61 million. Claims and claims adjustment expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 included favorable prior year loss development of $103 million, which consists of $35 million in first liens, $42 million in second liens, $16 million in student loans and $10 million in the international business. This favorable prior year development was offset by current accident year losses attributable to business written in 2008 and prior;  •the $189 million decrease in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses reflects lower levels of newly reported delinquencies, increased denied and rescinded claims and favorable loss development of $35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $120 million of unfavorable development during the same period in 2011. The favorable development of $35 million in 2012, included $118 million of favorable development arising from the claims requests sent to lenders mentioned above, offset by $83 million of unfavorable development on delinquencies for which claim requests were not made;  •the $89 million decline in second-lien business claims and claims adjustment expenses primarily reflects a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expenses paid; and  130      Table of Contents  •the increased claims and claims adjustment expenses in the international business reflects a reduction in claim reserves during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 due to a settlement of certain delinquencies with a major European lender that resulted in a $43 million benefit.  These items were partially offset by:  •a decline in first-lien earned premiums of $36 million reflecting higher premium refunds due to the rescissions arising from the claims requests sent to lenders during the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing into the first nine months of 2012, as discussed in Outlook herein, in addition to the declining persistency on the 2008 and prior policy years;  •a decline in earned premiums on second-lien, and international businesses, both of which were placed into run-off during 2008, of $33 million and $16 million respectively; and  •a $17 million increase in underwriting expenses driven primarily by an increase in underwriting, sales and product initiatives. All of these activities support the increase in new insurance written for the year.  New insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, was approximately $26 billion and $11 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in new insurance written is the result of the market acceptance by lenders of UGC's risk-based pricing model and withdrawal of certain competitors from the market during 2011.

Global Capital Markets (GCM) Operations  GCM reported pre-tax income in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2011 primarily due to improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio, improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the GCM derivative assets and liabilities and a decrease in operating expenses. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, unrealized market valuation gains of $204 million and $3 million, respectively, were recognized. The improvement resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2012, no net credit valuation adjustment gains or losses were recognized, compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $97 million in 2011. The improvement resulted primarily from a tightening of counterparty credit spreads.  GCM reported pre-tax income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to a pre-tax loss in the same period in 2011 primarily due to improvement in unrealized market valuations related to the super senior CDS portfolio and a decrease in operating expenses. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, unrealized market valuation gains of $401 million and $232 million, respectively, were recognized. The improvement resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization and price movements within the CDS portfolio.  131      Table of Contents See Critical Accounting Estimates – Level 3 Assets and Liabilities herein for a discussion of the super senior CDS portfolio.    Direct Investment Book Results  The DIB's pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected and gains realized from unwinding certain transactions. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, net credit valuation adjustment gains of $323 million and $54 million, respectively, were recognized. The improvement resulted primarily from gains on assets due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by losses on liabilities due to the tightening of AIG's credit spreads.  The DIB's pre-tax income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to realized capital gains in 2012 and improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. In the first quarter of 2012, the DIB realized a capital gain of $426 million on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, net credit valuation adjustment gains of $453 million and $370 million, respectively, were recognized. The improvement resulted primarily from gains on assets due to the tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by losses on liabilities due to the tightening of AIG's credit spreads.  The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the DIB assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected (excluding intercompany transactions):                                                                Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment on Assets:                              Bond trading securities     $ 446   $ (403 )   $ 1,048   $ (121 )    Loans and other assets       3     (1 )     26     17            Increase (decrease) in assets     $ 449   $ (404 )   $ 1,074   $ (104 )          AIG's Own Credit Valuation Adjustment on Liabilities:                              Notes and bonds payable     $ (44 )   $ 164     $ (227 )   $ 160      Hybrid financial instrument liabilities       (57 )     186       (273 )     178      Guaranteed Investment Agreements       (17 )     85       (90 )     114      Other liabilities       (8 )     23       (31 )     22            (Increase) decrease in liabilities     $ (126 )   $ 458     $ (621 )   $ 474            Net pre-tax increase to Other income     $ 323   $ 54     $ 453   $ 370               Retained Interests    Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities  On March 7, 2012, AIG sold approximately 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA and recognized a gain of $0.6 billion. On September 11, 2012, AIG sold approximately 600 million ordinary shares of AIA for a loss of $19 million. As a result of these sales, AIG's retained interest in AIA decreased from approximately 33 percent with a total carrying value of $12.4 billion at December 31, 2011 to approximately 14 percent with a total carrying value of $6.1 billion at September 30, 2012. The fair value of AIG's remaining interest in AIA securities increased $527 million and $1.8 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively.    Change in Fair Value of ML III  The gains attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were based in part on the completion of the final auction of ML III assets by the FRBNY, in the third quarter of 2012.  132      Table of Contents     Change in Fair Value of the MetLife Securities Prior to Sale  AIG recognized a loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, representing the decline in the securities' value, due to market conditions, from December 31, 2010 through the date of their sale in the first quarter of 2011.    Corporate & Other  Corporate & Other reported a higher pre-tax loss in the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to:  •lower net realized capital gains on foreign-denominated debt resulting from U.S. dollar strengthening against the euro and the British pound; and  •lower gains on real estate dispositions and losses on real estate equity investments.  Partially offsetting these losses was a reduction in expense of $117 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012 resulting from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the Department of the Treasury's underwriting fees for the sale of AIG Common Stock as shares were sold at a price lower than had been estimated at the time the accrual was established and AIG repurchased a significant amount of shares for which no payment to the underwriters was required.  Corporate & Other reported a decline in pre-tax losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to the effects of the following:  •a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in 2011 in connection with the transactions to recapitalize AIG, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility;   •reduction in expense of $184 million in 2012 resulting from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the Department of the Treasury's underwriting fees described above: and  •a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the exchange of outstanding junior subordinated debentures for senior unsecured notes in 2011.  Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in corporate expenses due to an increased estimated litigation liability of approximately $729 million based on developments in several actions, ongoing corporate initiatives and higher compensation expense, which varies in part based on AIG's stock price.  Real estate and other non-core businesses declined due to lower gains on real estate dispositions and higher equity losses on real estate investments.  133                Table of Contents      Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss)     The following table presents AIG's consolidated comprehensive income (loss):                                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011              Net income (loss)      $ 1,861   $ (3,826 )   NM %    $ 7,649   $ (272 )   NM %          Change in unrealized appreciation of investments        5,155     2,930     76        9,946     5,756     73        Change in deferred acquisition costs adjustment and other        (405   )   108     NM        (903   )   (580 )   (56 )    Change in future policy benefits        (442   )   (1,665 )   73        (509   )   (1,665 )   69        Change in foreign currency translation adjustments        258     (529 )   NM        (167   )   428     NM      Change in net derivative gains (losses) arising from cash flow hedging activities        3     14     (79 )      11     45     (76 )      Change in retirement plan liabilities adjustment        20     (558 )   NM        66     (548 )   NM      Change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations        –     (2,707 )   NM        –     (5,041 )   NM        Deferred tax liability        (1,490   )   (763 )   (95 )      (2,710   )   (231 )   NM            Other comprehensive income (loss)        3,099     (3,170   )   NM        5,734     (1,836 )   NM              Comprehensive income (loss)        4,960     (6,996   )   NM        13,383     (2,108 )   NM            Total comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests        8     58     (86 )      253     432     (41 )            Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to AIG      $ 4,952   $ (7,054 )   NM %    $ 13,130   $ (2,540 )   NM %               Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments     The increases in 2012 were primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to lower interest rates and narrowing spreads for investment grade and high yield securities. U.S. Treasury rates increased during the first quarter of 2012, however spreads narrowed more than the increase in U.S. Treasury rates, resulting in lower rates and increased unrealized appreciation in the quarter. U.S. Treasury rates declined during the second quarter of 2012, with the ten year rate declining to a historical low during the quarter. Partially offsetting the U.S. Treasury rate decline were widening spreads, although the increased spreads were less than the U.S. Treasury rate decline. U.S. Treasury rates ended the third quarter of 2012 approximately flat; however, spreads narrowed considerably in the quarter, resulting in significant unrealized appreciation.  During 2011, the insurance operations portfolios experienced appreciation in bonds available for sale and increased valuations on cost method partnerships, and appreciation on equities available for sale. The bond appreciation was driven by lower rates, with spread tightening on high yield securities more than offsetting the U.S. Treasury rate increase during the first quarter of 2011. Higher valuations on cost method partnerships also contributed to the appreciation during the first quarter of 2011, driven by positive equity market performance. A combination of lower U.S. Treasury rates and spread tightening on investment grade securities drove appreciation during the second quarter of 2011, with an additional contribution coming from appreciation in AIG's investment in the PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd. U.S. Treasury rates dropped significantly in the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by spreads widening. The net effect was an increase in unrealized appreciation, primarily in respect of government obligations and high grade fixed securities. The third quarter of 2011 reflected challenging conditions for equity securities, with AIG's investment in The Blackstone Group L.P. and PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd experiencing unrealized losses.  The effects of reclassification adjustments included in net income on unrealized appreciation of investments were $877 million and $2.7 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $621 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.  134      Table of Contents See Investments – Investment Highlights – Securities available for sale herein for a table on the gross unrealized gains (losses) of AIG's available for sale securities by type of security.      Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other     The change in DAC in 2012 is primarily the result of increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest-sensitive products. DAC for investment-oriented products is adjusted for changes in estimated gross profits that result from changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale. Because fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to DAC equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. These adjustments, net of tax, are included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).      Change in Future Policy Benefits     Primarily as a result of the increase in unrealized appreciation of investments during the three-month period ended September 30, 2012, AIG recorded additional future policy benefits through Other comprehensive income. This change in future policy benefits assumes the securities underlying certain traditional long-duration products had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and reinvested at current yields. This increase in future policy benefits was partially offset by loss reserve recognition resulting from sales of securities in unrealized gain positions.      Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments     The change in foreign currency translation adjustment was a net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2012 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar compared to a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2011, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, Canadian dollar, partially offset by the appreciation of the Japanese yen.  The change in foreign currency translation adjustments was a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen compared to a net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen.      Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities     The decline primarily reflects the gradual run-off of the cash flow hedge portfolio, partially offset by a decline in the interest rate environment.      Change in Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment     The positive adjustment in 2012, compared to the negative adjustment in 2011, is primarily due to the 2011 remeasurement of certain U.S. plans and fluctuations in exchange rates in effect for 2012 compared to 2011. The AIG Retirement and AIG Excess Plans were remeasured in 2011 due to the conversion of those plans to cash balance plans, and AIG recognized a reduction in Accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with the remeasurement in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate. The AIG Postretirement Plan was remeasured in 2011 as a result of the elimination of the retiree medical employer subsidy for certain employees.      Change Attributable to Divestitures and Deconsolidations     The change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations in 2011 primarily reflects the derecognition of all items in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the time of sale for AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan.  135      Table of Contents     Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the effective tax rates on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Income were 32.5 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance and the effect of foreign operations.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the effective tax rates on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Loss were (31.7) percent and (14.4) percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2011 differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance, the Nan Shan disposition, and the effect of foreign operations. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to the AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan dispositions and the effect of foreign operations. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, the entire increase in the valuation allowance was allocated to continuing operations.      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES         Overview     Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet payment obligations. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances.  AIG manages its liquidity and capital resources at the legal entity level. AIG's ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of its businesses, general economic conditions and its access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described in this section. AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.  As part of the active management of its capital, AIG may, depending on market conditions, rating agency considerations and other factors, from time to time take various actions, including possibly repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers.  Highlights of actions taken during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 that affected liquidity and capital resources include:  •AIG Share Repurchases – Purchases of AIG Common Stock totaling approximately $13.0 billion in the 2012 Offerings by the Department of the Treasury;  •Pay down of AIA SPV Preferred Interests – $8.6 billion in liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury (representing the full amount outstanding) was paid down in full in March using both existing funds and the proceeds from the following sources:      •Sale of approximately 1.72 billion AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion;   •Distributions of approximately $1.6 billion to AIG from the FRBNY's final disposition of ML II securities; and   •Use of existing funds allocated to the MIP;    •Additional Sale of AIA Shares – Sale in September of approximately 600 million AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion;  •ML III Distributions – Distributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 of approximately $8.5 billion to AIG from the FRBNY's dispositions of ML III assets;  •Funding from Subsidiaries – approximately $4.7 billion paid to AIG Parent from subsidiaries, including:      •Approximately $1.0 billion and $636 million in non-cash and cash dividends respectively, from AIG Property Casualty;    136      Table of Contents    •$2.4 billion in note repayments from AIG Life and Retirement funded by payments of dividends from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries; and   •$400 million in dividends from the AIA SPV, representing the proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV to an AIG Property Casualty subsidiary;      •AIG Notes Offerings:    •A registered public offering of $750 million principal amount of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.800% Notes Due 2017 for the MIP in the first quarter of 2012. The proceeds were used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP;   •Two registered public offerings of an aggregate $1.5 billion principal amount of 4.875% Notes Due 2022 in the second quarter of 2012. The proceeds from these two offerings are being used for general corporate purposes, which are currently expected to include the repayment of debt maturing in 2013; and   •A registered public offering of $250 million principal amount of 2.375% Subordinated Notes Due 2015 in the third quarter of 2012. The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes;    •Debt Reduction – repayment of total debt of $ 10.1 billion, which includes repayments of $ 3.0 billion by AIG Parent;  •ALICO Escrow Release – $950 million held in escrow in connection with the sale of ALICO was released to AIG on August 31, 2012 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information); and •ILFC Debt Financings – $4.0 billion in the aggregate of secured and unsecured financings, consisting of the issuance of $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and $1.7 billion in secured term loans.  See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries – Sources of Liquidity herein for further discussion.      Liquidity Adequacy Management     AIG maintains a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess its aggregate exposure to its most significant risks. This framework is built on AIG's existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The scenarios are performed with a two-year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks.  AIG's insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions. These constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses, based on capital assessments under rating agency, regulatory and business requirements. Using ERM's stress testing methodology, the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation to determine the liquidity required of AIG Parent to support the insurance operations and maintain their target capitalization levels. Added to this amount is the contingent liquidity required from AIG Parent under stressed scenarios for non-insurance operations.  AIG operates within the updated liquidity risk appetite framework which was approved in September 2012. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels were established for base and stress scenarios over a two-year time horizon designed to ensure that daily funding needs are met across varying market conditions. In the event that defined risk tolerance levels are projected to be breached, AIG will take appropriate actions to further increase liquidity sources and/or reduce liquidity requirements to remain within the stated risk appetite, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions.  AIG has in place unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) with certain AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement insurance companies. These CMAs are expected to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and will help manage the flow of capital and funds between AIG Parent and its insurance company subsidiaries. AIG has also entered into and expects to enter into additional CMAs with certain other insurance companies as needed in 2012. For additional details regarding CMAs, see Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries – AIG Property Casualty, and AIG Life and Retirement, below.  137      Table of Contents Some circumstances may cause AIG's cash needs to exceed its liquidity sources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in AIG's credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or both. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit AIG's ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.      Dividend Restrictions     Payment of future dividends to AIG shareholders depends in part on the regulatory framework that will ultimately be applicable to AIG, including AIG's status as an SLHC under Dodd-Frank and whether AIG is determined to be a SIFI. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of potential restrictions on payments of dividends to common shareholders.  Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report for additional discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG and its subsidiaries.      Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash     The following table presents selected data from AIG's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:                                          Nine Months Ended September 30,        (in millions)     2012      2011              Summary:                  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities     $ 2,839    $ (1,201 )*      Net cash provided by investing activities       19,158      36,146      Net cash used in financing activities       (21,854   )    (35,444 )      Effect of exchange rate changes on cash       (9     )    37            Increase (decrease) in cash       134      (462 )      Cash at beginning of year       1,474      1,558      Change in cash of businesses held for sale       –      446              Cash at end of period     $ 1,608    $ 1,542              * Includes $3.4 billion of operating cash flows from divested foreign life insurance subsidiaries, including Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison.       Operating Cash Flow Activities     Interest payments totaled $3.1 billion and $8.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash paid for interest in the first nine months of 2011 includes the payment of FRBNY Credit Facility accrued compounded interest totaling $6.4 billion. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $5.9 billion and $6.8 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.  Cash provided by AIG Property Casualty operating activities was $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to cash used of $0.3 billion in the same period in 2011, primarily reflecting lower catastrophe losses, and underwriting improvements related to rate increases and enhanced risk selection, partially offset by higher acquisition costs as a result of the change in business mix from Commercial Insurance to Consumer Insurance. The nine months ended September 30, 2011 were affected by significant catastrophe losses, including the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan and earthquakes in New Zealand.  Cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion by AIG Life and Retirement was consistent for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. Aircraft Leasing generated cash from operating activities of $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion during the same periods. These cash flows reflected operating performance that was generally consistent for Aircraft Leasing in both periods.  138      Table of Contents     Investing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 includes the following items:  •distributions from AIG Life and Retirement related to the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II of approximately $1.6 billion;  •payments of approximately $8.5 billion received in connection with the dispositions of ML III assets by the FRBNY;   •gross proceeds of approximately $8.0 billion from the sale of approximately 2.3 billion AIA ordinary shares; and •approximately $1.0 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement.  Net cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to the utilization of previously restricted cash generated from the AIA initial public offering and the disposition of MetLife securities received in the ALICO sale. The restrictions on the cash were released in connection with the Recapitalization in 2011.      Financing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 includes the following activities:  •$8.6 billion pay down of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests; and •total payments of approximately $13.0 billion for the purchase of approximately 421 million shares of AIG Common Stock.  Net cash used in financing activities for 2011 primarily resulted from the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility and the $11.4 billion partial repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and the preferred interests in AM Holdings LLC (the ALICO SPV) in connection with the Recapitalization and use of proceeds received from the sales of foreign life insurance entities in 2011, all within Other operations.      Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries       AIG Parent     AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are short-term investments, borrowing availability under credit and contingent liquidity facilities and dividends, distributions and other payments from subsidiaries. In addition, subject to market conditions, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs, which include the payment of maturing debt of AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG maintains substantial actual and contingent liquidity.  The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity:                                   (In millions)      As of  September 30, 2012              Cash and short-term investments(a)     $ 7,059      Available capacity under Syndicated Credit Facilities(b)       3,537        Available capacity under Contingent Liquidity Facilities(c)       1,000            Total AIG Parent liquidity sources     $ 11,596              (a) Includes reverse repurchase agreements totaling $5.6 billion used to reduce unsecured exposures.  (b) AIG entered into an amended and restated syndicated bank credit facility on October 5, 2012. For additional information relating to this credit facility, see Credit Facilities below.  (c) AIG currently does not intend to enter into any put option agreements under one of its contingent liquidity facilities of $500 million; if AIG does not request to enter into such put option agreements by November 9, 2012, its right to do so will expire, thereby effectively terminating this contingent facility. For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facilities, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below.   139      Table of Contents Highlights of actions taken during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 that impacted liquidity include:  •In the first nine months of 2012, the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed four registered public offerings of AIG Common Stock, in which AIG purchased an aggregate of approximately $13 billion of AIG Common Stock at the initial public offering price in each offering. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these offerings.  •In March 2012, AIG paid down in full the remaining liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests and redeemed the Department of the Treasury's preferred participating return rights under the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV limited liability company agreements. As a result of these payments the following items, which had been held as security to support the repayment of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests, were released from that pledge:      •the equity interests in ILFC,   •the ordinary shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV,   •the common equity interest in the AIA SPV held by AIG,   •AIG's interests in ML III, and;   •cash held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) under the ALICO stock purchase agreement.    •In March 2012, AIG issued $750 million principal amount of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.800% Notes Due 2017, the proceeds of which were used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP.  •In May 2012, AIG issued $750 million principal amount of 4.875% Notes Due 2022 and in June 2012, AIG issued an additional $750 million principal amount of these notes. The proceeds from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes which are currently expected to include the repayment of debt maturing in 2013.  •In August 2012, AIG issued $250 million principal amount of 2.375% Subordinated Notes Due 2015. The proceeds from this offering are being used for general corporate purposes.  •In March 2012 and September 2012, AIG sold an aggregate of approximately 2.3 billion AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $8.0 billion, of which approximately $6.0 billion was used to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests, reducing total ownership in AIA from approximately 33 percent to approximately 14 percent.  •In the first nine months of 2012, distributions of approximately $8.5 billion to AIG from the FRBNY's dispositions of ML III assets. •In August 2012, $950 million held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife under the ALICO stock purchase agreement was released to AIG.      Sources of Liquidity     AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. In addition, as noted above, AIG expects to access the debt markets from time to time to meet its financing needs. In the first nine months of 2012, AIG Parent:  •collected $3.8 billion in cash payments from subsidiaries, including $2.4 billion in note repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries funded by payments of dividends from subsidiaries (representing an acceleration of planned 2012 payments from its subsidiaries) of which $1.6 billion represented proceeds from the FRBNY's sale of ML II assets, $636 million in dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries, and $400 million in dividends from the AIA SPV, representing the proceeds from the sale of shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV to an AIG Property Casualty subsidiary;  •collected approximately $1.0 billion in non-cash dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries in the form of municipal bonds;  140                Table of Contents   •issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP (described more fully in Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries – Other Operations – Direct Investment Book below);  •issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes to be used for general corporate purposes;   •issued $250 million of subordinated unsecured notes to be used for general corporate purposes; and •sold approximately 2.3 billion AIA ordinary shares for gross proceeds of approximately $8.0 billion, of which approximately $6.0 billion was utilized to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests, reducing total ownership in AIA from approximately 33 percent to approximately 14 percent.      Uses of Liquidity     AIG Parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. In the first nine months of 2012, AIG Parent:  •retired $3.0 billion of debt, including $2.6 billion of MIP long-term debt, and made interest payments totaling $1.5 billion;  •purchased approximately 421 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the registered public offerings of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury for approximately $13.0 billion;  •utilized approximately $1.6 billion in proceeds from the distributions from ML II, approximately $6.0 billion in gross proceeds from the sale of the AIA ordinary shares and existing funds from the MIP to pay down the liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests and redeem the Department of the Treasury's preferred participating return rights in the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV;  •paid $550 million as a result of final approval of a settlement under the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information); and  •made $40 million in net subsidiary capital contributions.     AIG Property Casualty     AIG currently expects that AIG Property Casualty will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $7.2 billion as of September 30, 2012. Further, AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, which AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries could monetize in the event liquidity levels are deemed insufficient. AIG Property Casualty paid cash and non-cash dividends of $75 million and $1.6 billion to AIG Parent in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. In addition, on October 19, 2012, AIG Property Casualty paid a cash dividend of $800 million to AIG Parent.  AIG could be required to provide additional liquidity to AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries under certain circumstances, including:  •large catastrophes that may require AIG to provide additional support to the affected AIG Property Casualty operations;   •downgrades in AIG's credit ratings that could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of AIG's subsidiaries which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations;   •increases in market interest rates that may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital; and  •other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain, including economic collapse of a nation or region significant to AIG Property Casualty operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.  141      Table of Contents     February 2011 CMAs     In February 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain domestic AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries. Among other things, the CMAs provided that AIG would maintain the total adjusted capital of these individual AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiaries' projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC) (as defined by National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) guidelines and determined based on the subsidiaries' statutory financial statements). As a result, the CMAs provided that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries fell below the specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, AIG would contribute cash or other instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally have been made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG could also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deemed appropriate. In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total authorized control level RBCs, subject to board approval, the subsidiaries would have declared and paid ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of:   (i)the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or (ii)the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law.  The CMAs did not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board or regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMAs would generally have been made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplated that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum percentage was 425 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2011, AIG received a total of approximately $1.3 billion in dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and made no contributions to AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries under the CMAs.      February 2012 – New CMAs     In February 2012, AIG, Chartis Inc. and certain of its domestic insurance subsidiaries, entered into a new, single CMA, which replaced the CMAs entered into in February 2011. The new CMA is structured similarly to the February 2011 CMAs that it replaces, except that under the new CMA, the total adjusted capital and total authorized control level RBC of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries are measured as a group (the Fleet) rather than on an individual company basis. As a result, the new CMA provides that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of the Fleet at or above a specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's projected total authorized control level RBC. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2012, AIG did not receive any dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $1.5 billion in dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries, consisting of cash and municipal bonds, and made no contributions to AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries under the new CMA. Effective February 17, 2012, the specified minimum percentage is 350 percent.  In March 2012, the National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (NUFI), an AIG Property Casualty company, became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh. In August 2012, Chartis Specialty Insurance Company (CSI), an AIG Property Casualty company, became a member of the FHLB of Chicago. FHLB membership provides participants with access to various services, including access to low-cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage-backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets. These advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes. As of September 30, 2012, neither NUFI nor CSI had any advances outstanding under their respective facilities.    AIG Life and Retirement     Management considers the sources of liquidity for AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries adequate to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies  142      Table of Contents or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Management, however, has recently initiated some specific programs intended to provide additional sources of actual and contingent liquidity. The AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries continue to maintain liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $5.8 billion as of September 30, 2012. In the first nine months of 2012, AIG Life and Retirement provided $2.4 billion of liquidity to AIG Parent through the payment of dividends from insurance subsidiaries. These payments from the insurance subsidiaries included a $1.6 billion return of capital distribution of the insurance subsidiaries interests in ML II from the FRBNY's sale of the underlying assets. On October 31, 2012, AIG Parent received a distribution of $454 million from AIG Life and Retirement in the form of a note repayment.  The most significant potential liquidity requirements of the AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries are the funding of product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities. Given the size and liquidity profile of AIG Life and Retirement's investment portfolios, AIG believes that normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not constitute a significant liquidity risk. As part of its risk management framework, AIG Life and Retirement continues to evaluate and implement programs to enhance its liquidity position and facilitate AIG Life and Retirement's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio, including securities lending programs and other secured financings structured to increase liquidity.  During 2012, AIG Life and Retirement began utilizing securities lending programs to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, the AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to highly liquid short-term investments. AIG Life and Retirement's liability to the borrower for collateral received was $1.88 billion as of September 30, 2012. In addition, in 2011, certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries became members of the FHLBs in their respective districts, primarily as an additional source of liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. As of September 30, 2012, AIG Life and Retirement had outstanding borrowings of $82 million from the FHLBs.  In March 2011, AIG entered into CMAs with certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG will maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary's projected Company Action Level RBCs. As a result, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries falls below the specified minimum percentage of their respective Company Action Level RBCs, AIG will contribute cash or instruments admissible under applicable regulations to these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries in the amount necessary to increase total adjusted capital to a level at least equal to such specified minimum percentage. Any required contribution under the CMAs would generally be made during the second and fourth quarters of each year; however, AIG may also make contributions in such amounts and at such times as it deems appropriate.  In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBCs, subject to board approval, the subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount that is the lesser of:  •(i) the amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage or  •(ii) the maximum amount of ordinary dividends permitted under applicable insurance law.  The CMAs do not prohibit, however, the payment of extraordinary dividends, subject to board and regulatory approval, to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than the specified minimum percentage. Any required dividend under the CMAs would generally be made on a quarterly basis. As structured, the CMAs contemplate that the specified minimum percentage would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. The initial specified minimum percentage was 350 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, which had a specified minimum percentage of 250 percent. Effective March 30, 2012, the specified minimum percentage increased from 350 percent to 435 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage remained at 250 percent.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, AIG received a total of approximately $1.4 billion in distributions from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries in the form of note repayments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, AIG received a total of approximately $2.4 billion in distributions from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries in the form of note repayments. AIG made no contributions under the CMAs in either period.  143      Table of Contents     Aircraft Leasing     ILFC's sources of liquidity include existing cash and short-term investments of $2.6 billion, future cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities, debt issuances, and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. Uses of liquidity for ILFC primarily consist of aircraft purchases and debt repayments.  On February 23, 2012, ILFC closed on a $900 million senior secured term loan due in 2017. ILFC used the proceeds from this loan to prepay the $457 million outstanding under its five-year revolving syndicated bank facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The senior secured term loan is secured primarily by a first priority perfected lien on the equity of certain ILFC subsidiaries that directly or indirectly own a pool of aircraft and related leases. Also on February 23, 2012, AeroTurbine amended its revolving credit facility to increase the maximum aggregate amount available by $95 million to $430 million.  On March 19, 2012, ILFC issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $750 million principal amount of 4.875% Notes due 2015 and $750 million principal amount of 5.875% Notes due 2019. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay ILFC's $750 million senior secured term loan scheduled to mature in 2015 and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the purchase of aircraft.  On April 12, 2012, ILFC refinanced its $550 million secured term loan due in 2016. The new secured term loan, which matures in April 2016, bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%, compared to interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 5.0% and a LIBOR floor of 2.0% for the loan that was refinanced.  On April 23, 2012, ILFC closed on a $203 million senior secured term loan due in 2018. ILFC used the proceeds from this loan for the acquisition of seven new aircraft delivered in 2012.  On August 21, 2012, ILFC issued $750 million principal amount of 5.875% Notes due 2022. The proceeds from the sale of these notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the purchase of aircraft.  On October 9, 2012, ILFC entered into a new $2.3 billion three-year revolving credit facility and terminated the existing $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility.  See Debt herein for further details on ILFC's revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt.     Other Operations         Mortgage Guaranty     AIG currently expects that its Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, asset dispositions. Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, totaling $690 million as of September 30, 2012. Further, Mortgage Guaranty businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds ($2.8 billion in the aggregate at September 30, 2012), which could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.      Global Capital Markets     Global Capital Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services. It executes its derivative trades under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings. Many of GCM's transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements. However, generally, no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties. Most of GCM's CDS are subject to collateral posting provisions. These provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of AIG's credit ratings, the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. AIG estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDS using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into AIG's liquidity planning assumptions.  144      Table of Contents As of September 30, 2012, GCM had total assets of $7.4 billion and total liabilities of $4.7 billion. GCM's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM's liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted by operations included in GCM to third parties was $4.3 billion and $5.1 billion at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Collateral obtained by operations included in GCM from third parties was $910 million and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.      Direct Investment Book     The DIB is comprised of the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The DIB's assets consist primarily of cash, short term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by U.S. government and government sponsored entities, mortgage and asset backed securities, equity securities and to a lesser extent bank loans and mortgage loans. The DIB's liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short term obligations related to unsettled trades and short-term financing obligations. As of September 30, 2012, the DIB had total assets of $32.4 billion and total liabilities of $25.9 billion. The assets and liabilities and operating results of the DIB exclude the value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The value of these hedges is included in the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM.  AIG's risk target for the DIB is to maintain sufficient liquidity, at all times, to cover any payments on maturing DIB liabilities even under the stress scenarios defined by ERM. Management believes that the DIB has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its maturing liabilities even in these stress scenarios, without having to liquidate DIB assets or rely on additional liquidity from AIG Parent. If the DIB's risk target is breached, AIG expects to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB's liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2012, the DIB used current program liquidity to pay down $5.7 billion in debt. In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, AIG issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, consisting of $750 million principal amount of 3.000% Notes Due 2015 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.800% Notes Due 2017. The proceeds from the sale of these notes are being used to continue to reduce the risk of, and better match the assets and liabilities in, the MIP and the notes are included within MIP notes payable in the debt outstanding table in "Debt – Debt Maturities" below.  During the first quarter of 2012, AIG allocated cash from the DIB to pay down the AIA SPV Preferred Interests. In exchange, AIG's remaining interest in ML III and the future proceeds from the cash held in escrow to secure indemnities provided to MetLife were allocated to the MIP. During the third quarter of 2012, the DIB received approximately $8.5 billion in distributions from the FRBNY's auctions of ML III assets.  In September 2012, a portion of AIA ordinary shares were allocated to the DIB by AIG after the AIA SPV, a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, distributed those shares to AIG in a dividend.  From time to time, AIG may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target, for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB.  Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $4.6 billion and $5.1 billion at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.      Credit Facilities     AIG maintains credit facilities as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Currently, AIG and ILFC maintain committed, revolving credit facilities, including a facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit, summarized in the following table for general corporate purposes and for letter of credit issuance. AIG currently expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration, although no assurance can  145      Table of Contents be given that these facilities will be replaced on favorable terms or at all. All facilities, except for ILFC's four-year AeroTurbine syndicated credit facility maturing December 2015, are unsecured.                            October 15, 2012   (in millions)  Facility      Size      Available Amount      Expiration      Effective Date          AIG:                        Four-Year Syndicated Credit Facility     4,000     3,037   October 2016   10/5/2012          Total AIG   $ 4,000   $ 3,037                  ILFC:                        Four-Year AeroTurbine Syndicated Facility      430     164   December 2015   12/9/2011      Three-Year Syndicated Facility     2,300     2,300   October 2015   10/9/2012        Total ILFC   $ 2,730   $ 2,464                 On October 5, 2012, AIG terminated the previously outstanding AIG $1.5 billion 364-Day syndicated credit facility and amended and restated the four-year syndicated credit facility that was entered into in October 2011 (the Previous Facility). The amended and restated four-year syndicated credit facility (the Four-Year Facility) provides for $4.0 billion of revolving loans (increased from $3.0 billion in the Previous Facility), which includes a $2.0 billion letter of credit sublimit. The approximately $1.0 billion of previously issued letters of credit under the Previous Facility were rolled into the letter of credit sublimit within the Four-Year Facility, so that a total of approximately $3.0 billion remains available under this facility, of which approximately $1.0 billion remains available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on the Four-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  AIG's ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility is not contingent on its credit ratings. However, AIG's ability to borrow under this facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility, including covenants relating to AIG's maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility would restrict AIG's access to the Four-Year Facility and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on AIG's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.  ILFC's three-year credit facility, which became effective on October 9, 2012, contains customary events of default and restrictive financial covenants that, among other things, requires ILFC to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum ratio of consolidated indebtedness to shareholder's equity. This facility replaced ILFC's previous three-year credit facility that was scheduled to expire in January 2014 and was terminated on October 9, 2012. ILFC is a guarantor for a four-year credit facility entered into by AeroTurbine, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ILFC, whose assets are pledged as security for the outstanding amount. In February 2012, ILFC increased AeroTurbine's facility by $95 million to $430 million.      Contingent Liquidity Facilities     AIG has access to contingent liquidity facilities of up to $1 billion as potential sources of liquidity for general corporate purposes:  •In 2010, AIG established a $500 million contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG and the counterparty.   •In October 2011, AIG entered into a contingent liquidity facility (the 2011 Contingent Liquidity Facility) under which AIG has the right, for a period of approximately one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years from the date any such put option agreement is entered into, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIG's discretion.  146                Table of Contents  AIG currently does not intend to enter into any put option agreements under the 2011 Contingent Liquidity Facility. If AIG does not request to enter into such put option agreements by November 9, 2012, then AIG's ability to issue any senior debt to the financial institution will expire and the 2011 Contingent Liquidity Facility will effectively be terminated.  AIG's ability to borrow under these facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings.      Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                     September 30, 2012         Payments due by Period       (in millions)      Total Payments      Remainder of 2012      2013 - 2014      2015 - 2016      2017      Thereafter              Loss reserves   $ 90,665   $ 11,061   $ 29,194   $ 16,093   $ 5,259   $ 29,058      Insurance and investment contract liabilities      235,341     14,058     25,112     24,538     10,651     160,982        Aircraft purchase commitments     17,708     263     3,071     5,669     4,235     4,470      Borrowings     71,929     846     12,914     12,862     9,058     36,249        Interest payments on borrowings     52,895     1,087     7,665     6,530     2,629     34,984      Other long-term obligations(a)     159     13     57     13     1     75              Total(b)   $ 468,697   $ 27,328   $ 78,013   $ 65,705   $ 31,833   $ 265,818              (a) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.  (b) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. In addition, the majority of AIG's credit default swaps require AIG to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. At September 30, 2012, the fair value derivative liability was $2.2 billion, relating to the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio. Due to the long-term maturities of these credit default swaps, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. At September 30, 2012, collateral posted with respect to these swaps was $1.8 billion.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments     The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                     September 30, 2012              Amount of Commitment Expiring          (in millions)      Total Amounts Committed   Remainder of 2012   2013 - 2014   2015 - 2016   2017   Thereafter            Guarantees:                                          Liquidity facilities(a)   $ 101   $ –   $ –   $ –   $ –   $ 101      Standby letters of credit      322     309     10     3     –     –      Guarantees of indebtedness     191     –     –     –     –     191      All other guarantees(b)     471     57     44     180     66     124      Commitments:                                          Investment commitments(c)     2,445     1,955     279     211     –     –      Commitments to extend credit     351     297     54     –     –     –      Letters of credit     31     20     11     –     –     –      Other commercial commitments(d)     800     24     6     –     –     770            Total(e)   $ 4,712   $ 2,662   $ 404   $ 394   $ 66   $ 1,186              (a) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.  (b) Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and AIG Life and Retirement construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts attributable to indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  (c) Includes commitments to invest in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.  (d) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2012 is expected to be approximately $15 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.  (e) Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.   147      Table of Contents    Securities Financing     At December 31, 2011, the fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.1 billion and the related cash collateral obtained was $1.6 billion. At September 30, 2012, there were no securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales and no related cash collateral obtained. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the modification of the criteria for determining whether securities transferred under repurchase agreements are accounted for as sales.    Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities     While AIG enters into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. AIG consolidates a VIE when it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of AIG's involvement with VIEs, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.      Debt       Debt Maturities     The following table summarizes maturing debt at September 30, 2012 of AIG and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters:                                     (in millions)      Fourth Quarter 2012   First Quarter 2013   Second Quarter 2013   Third Quarter 2013   Total            ILFC   $ 141   $ 1,376   $ 738   $ 1,043   $ 3,298      Borrowings supported by assets (DIB)      552     494     147     784     1,977      General borrowings     153     –     1,000     –     1,153      Other     –     46     204     163     413            Total   $ 846   $ 1,916   $ 2,089   $ 1,990   $ 6,841             Resources available to meet maturing obligations include:  •ILFC's existing cash and short-term investments of $2.6 billion, as well as its future cash flows from operations, debt issuances and aircraft sales, subject to market and other conditions. See Liquidity of Parent and Subsidiaries – Aircraft Leasing. Additionally, at September 30, 2012, ILFC had $2.0 billion available under its unsecured three-year revolving credit facility and an additional $164 million available under AeroTurbine's secured revolving credit agreement. Subsequent to September 30, 2012, ILFC entered into a new $2.3 billion three-year revolving credit facility, and terminated the existing $2.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility. AIG expects that ILFC will refinance its existing debt or issue additional debt as necessary to meet its maturing debt obligations.  •AIG borrowings supported by assets consist of debt under the MIP as well as AIGFP debt included in the DIB. Mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold or AIG to access the capital markets to satisfy maturing liabilities. Depending on market conditions and the ability to sell assets at that time, proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities. Any shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent. At September 30, 2012, all of the debt maturities in the DIB through September 30, 2013 are supported by short-term investments and maturing investments.  148      Table of Contents The following table provides the rollforward of AIG's total debt outstanding:                                     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012                                  Balance at December 31, 2011       Maturities and Repayments   Effect of Foreign Exchange         Balance at September 30, 2012          (in millions)   Issuances   Other Changes            Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                          General borrowings:                                          Notes and bonds payable    $ 12,725    $ 1,508    $ (244 )  $ 53    $ (2 )  $ 14,040      Subordinated debt      –      250      –      –      –      250      Junior subordinated debt      9,327      –      –      41      (2 )    9,366      Loans and mortgages payable       234      –      (2 )    (2 )    2      232      SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc. notes and bonds payable      298      –      –      –      –      298      Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock       1,339      –      –      –      –      1,339            Total general borrowings      23,923      1,758      (246 )    92      (2 )    25,525            Borrowings supported by assets:                                          MIP notes payable      10,147      1,995      (2,556 )    (57 )    (71 )    9,458      Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable      3,807      –      (195 )    –      (20 )    3,592      GIAs, at fair value      7,964      436      (1,500 )    –      66 (a)    6,966      Notes and bonds payable, at fair value      2,316      17      (1,383 )    –      681 (a)    1,631      Loans and mortgages payable, at fair value       486      –      (248 )    –      – (a)    238            Total borrowings supported by assets      24,720      2,448      (5,882 )    (57 )    656      21,885            Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG      48,643      4,206      (6,128 )    35      654      47,410            Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                          ILFC:                                          Notes and bonds payable, ECA facility, bank financings and other secured financings(b)      23,365      3,481      (3,676 )    –      20      23,190      Junior subordinated debt      999      –      –      –      –      999            Total ILFC debt      24,364      3,481      (3,676 )    –      20      24,189            Other subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable      393      57      (111 )    (7 )    (2 )    330            Debt of consolidated investments(c)      1,853      241      (211 )    –      (64 )    1,819            Total debt not guaranteed by AIG      26,610      3,779      (3,998 )    (7 )    (46 )    26,338            Total debt    $ 75,253    $ 7,985    $ (10,126 )  $ 28    $ 608    $ 73,748              (a) Primarily represents adjustments to the fair value of debt.

The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of October 26, 2012. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category.

(c)Fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. (d)AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Funding, Inc.   These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management's request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.  "Ratings triggers" have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. "Ratings triggers" generally relate to events that (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.  Adverse ratings actions regarding AIG's long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require AIGFP to post additional collateral payments pursuant to, and/or permit the termination of, derivative transactions to which AIGFP is a party, which could adversely affect AIG's business, its consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or its liquidity. Credit ratings estimate a company's ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability to that company of financing. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of AIGFP's counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts.  The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of AIG's insurance companies or AIG's credit ratings, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2011 Annual Report.  151                Table of Contents      INVESTMENTS         Market Conditions     AIG's investments and investment strategies were affected by the following conditions in the third quarter of 2012:  •Central Banks initiated actions in the quarter intended to improve weakening economic conditions, including the European Central Bank's commitment to further bond purchases and the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to maintain the Federal Funds Rate in the zero to a quarter percent range. The Federal Reserve also committed to support the mortgage market via purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, and extended "Operation Twist", a program of redeeming short-term U.S. Treasury securities and using the proceeds to buy longer-term U.S. Treasury securities with the objective of putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.   •Equity markets experienced positive returns during the quarter and remain in a gain position year to date.   •Bond yields remained low in the U.S., as evidenced by the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate ending the current quarter at 1.63 percent, approximately the same rate as at the prior quarter-end.  •The U.S. dollar weakened during the quarter by 2 percent, 3 percent and 2 percent versus the Euro, British pound and Yen, respectively.      Investment Strategies     AIG's investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses: general insurance, life insurance, retirement services and the Direct Investment book. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products.  At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. The majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.   •In the case of life insurance and retirement services companies, as well as in the DIB, the fundamental investment strategy is, as nearly as is practicable, to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration.  •Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of AIG Property Casualty, cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.   •Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities.      Investment Highlights     An overview of investment activities during the first nine months of 2012 follows:  •Risk weighted opportunistic investments in RMBS and other structured securities continued to be made to improve yields and increase net investment income. AIG purchased an aggregate of $7.1 billion of CDOs sold in the FRBNY auctions of ML III assets, and elected fair value accounting treatment on those assets.   •Purchases of corporate debt securities continued to be the largest asset allocation of new investments.   •A low interest rate environment and declining spreads in many fixed income asset classes contributed to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio.  152      Table of Contents  •Blended investment yields on new AIG Life and Retirement investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called. Base yields at AIG Property Casualty benefited from blended yields on new investments that were higher than the yields on investments that were sold, matured or called.   •Other-than-temporary-impairments on structured securities were down significantly from the respective prior-year periods.  Net investment income and unrealized and realized gains and losses are discussed under Consolidated Results.     Credit Ratings     At September 30, 2012, approximately 88 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by AIG's domestic entities. Approximately 18 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 13 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. AIG's investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.  A significant portion of AIG's foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities. AIG's Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2012, approximately 21 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG's internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 4 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated at that date. Approximately 50 percent of the foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.  With respect to AIG's fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) AIG's equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity investments that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or AIG, and represents primarily AIG's interest in ML III.  See Enterprise Risk Management herein for a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments.  153      Table of Contents The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG's fixed maturity

began purchasing certain RMBSs that had experienced deterioration in credit quality since their origination. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments – Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI) Securities, for additional discussion.  (b) The weighted average expected life was 5 years and 6 years at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.   AIG's underwriting practices for investing in RMBS, other asset-backed securities and CDOs take into consideration the quality of the originator, the manager, the servicer, security credit ratings, underlying characteristics of the mortgages, borrower characteristics, and the level of credit enhancement in the transaction.  159                Table of Contents    Investments in CMBS     The

The market value of CMBS holdings remained stable throughout 2012, improving over the third quarter of 2012 and is now in line with the amortized cost. The majority of AIG's investments in CMBS are in tranches that contain substantial protection features through collateral subordination. As indicated in the tables, downgrades have occurred on many CMBS holdings. The majority of CMBS holdings are traditional conduit transactions, broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas.

AIA Investment     On March 7, 2012, AIG sold approximately 1.72 billion ordinary shares of AIA for gross cash proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion. On September 11, 2012, AIG sold approximately 600 million ordinary shares of AIA for gross proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion. As a result of these sales, AIG's retained interest in AIA decreased from approximately 33 percent, with a total carrying value of $12.4 billion at December 31, 2011, to approximately 14 percent with a total carrying value of $6.1 billion at September 30, 2012. This investment is recorded in Other invested assets and accounted for under the fair value option.  In accordance with an agreement with the underwriters of the September 2012 sale of AIA ordinary shares, AIG may not sell or hedge the remaining AIA ordinary shares prior to December 10, 2012. After that time, AIG expects to monetize its investment in AIA ordinary shares from time to time depending on market conditions, AIG's liquidity position and opportunities for cash redeployment. The value of the AIA ordinary shares will continue to fluctuate for as long as they remain in AIG's portfolio. The value of these shares will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of AIG, including the business and financial performance of AIA.

impairment charges on private equity funds, hedge funds and direct private equity investments.   To determine other-than-temporary impairments, AIG uses fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. Based on this analysis, AIG expects to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.  AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 related to:  •issuer-specific credit events;  •securities for which AIG has changed its intent from hold to sell;  •declines due to foreign exchange rates;  •certain structured securities;  165                •other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts; and •securities that experienced severe market valuation declines.  There was no significant impact to AIG's consolidated financial condition or results of operations from other-than-temporary impairment charges for any one single credit. Also, no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.10 percent of Total equity in either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.  In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining life of the security. The amounts of accretion recognized in earnings were $215 million and $141 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $668 million and $355 million, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(d) The effect on Net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain DAC.  (e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.   For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $9.5 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads.  As of September 30, 2012, the majority of AIG's fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for 12 months or more consisted of the unrealized loss of $158 million related to CMBS and RMBS securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields. A total of 2 securities with an amortized cost of $12 million and a net unrealized loss of $10 million are still investment grade. As part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities, AIG considers  166      the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities. For most security types supported by real estate-related assets, current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities. This is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors. In addition, for floating rate securities, persistently low LIBOR levels continue to make these securities less attractive.  AIG believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral-based securities, low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads, and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts. Based on its analysis, and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities, AIG continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment. AIG continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals.  See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of AIG's investment portfolio.      ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT         Overview     Risk management is a key element of AIG's approach to corporate governance. AIG has an integrated process for managing risks throughout the organization. The Board has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. AIG's ERM Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of AIG's major business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view on the firm's major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM.  For a complete discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Enterprise Risk Management in the 2011 Annual Report.      Credit Risk Management     AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturity securities, equity securities, loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, derivatives (fair value changes and potential future exposure), deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, collateral extended to counterparties, commercial bank letters of credit received as collateral, guarantees, credit default swaps sold, and the specified credit equivalent exposures to certain insurance products which embody credit risk. Therefore, AIG's reported credit exposures to a counterparty reflect available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, trading securities, derivative exposures, insurance credit and any other counterparty credit exposures.  AIG monitors and controls its company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempts to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in certain circumstances, AIG may require third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. These guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts are also treated as credit exposure and are added to AIG's risk concentration exposure data.  AIG's single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 25 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2012 compared to 30 percent at December 31, 2011. Exposure to the U.S. Government primarily includes credit exposure related to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and to direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) based upon their U.S. Government conservatorship. The reduction in exposure was primarily related to U.S. government-sponsored entities. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at September 30, 2012, AIG's largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure, apart from ILFC leasing arrangements secured by aircraft with airlines having below investment grade ratings, was related to a non-financial corporate counterparty and that exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2012, compared to 0.5 percent at December 31, 2011.  167      AIG's single largest industry credit exposure at September 30, 2012 was to the global financial institutions sector, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of September 30, 2012, credit exposure to this sector was $87.1 billion, or 85 percent of Total equity compared to 106 percent at December 31, 2011.  At September 30, 2012:  •$82.2 billion, or 94 percent, of these global financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings.  •$4.8 billion, or 6 percent, were considered non-investment grade. Most of the non-investment grade exposure was to financial institutions in countries AIG does not consider of investment grade quality. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade-rated financial institutions was $2.1 billion.  •AIG's aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $35.5 billion.  •Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $15.0 billion, or 17 percent of the total global financial institution credit exposure. •The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, AIA ordinary shares, and the fronting of risk management policies to captive insurers of these financial institutions.  Of the $87.1 billion aggregate financial exposure, $30.0 billion was to United Kingdom and European-based financial institutions.   •$10.8 billion of this aggregate credit exposure was to non-bank institutions, mostly insurers and reinsurers, with $7.9 billion, or 73 percent, of credit exposure representing reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. $1.4 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non-banks was fixed maturity securities. Approximately 95 percent of the non-bank exposures were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings.  •Aggregate credit exposures to the United Kingdom- and European-based banks totaled $19.2 billion, of which $17.8 billion were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade-rated credit exposures to European banks were $1.4 billion. •AIG's credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $7.8 billion, of which $4.3 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the five countries of the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $1.0 billion, of which $694 million were fixed maturity securities. These credit exposures are primarily in Spain and Italy. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $1.5 billion, of which $769 million were fixed maturity securities. AIG's credit exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in these countries.  168      The following table presents AIG's aggregate credit exposures to banks in the United Kingdom and Europe:                                                                                         September 30, 2012           (in millions)      Fixed Maturity Securities(a)     Cash and Short-Term Investments(b)     Derivatives(c)     Other(d)     Total     December 31, 2011 Total            Euro-Zone countries:                                          Netherlands     $ 2,034    $ 40    $ –    $ 1,025    $ 3,099    $ 3,311      Germany       569      560      21      669      1,819      2,134      France       769      435      40      209      1,453      1,895      Spain       502      66      –      57      625      853      Italy       192      1      9      67      269      571      Belgium       91      1      2      115      209      321      Ireland       –      56      –      29      85      270      Austria       139      2      –      10      151      186      Greece       –      –      –      7      7      1      Other Euro-Zone       33      15      –      1      49      104            Total Euro-Zone     $ 4,329    $ 1,176    $ 72    $ 2,189    $ 7,766    $ 9,646            Remainder of Europe                                          United Kingdom     $ 3,857    $ 1,868    $ 440    $ 1,111    $ 7,276    $ 8,705      Sweden       873      678      –      35      1,586      2,128      Switzerland       900      411      21      267      1,599      2,026      Other remainder of Europe       466      479      –      63      1,008      1,034            Total remainder of Europe     $ 6,096    $ 3,436    $ 461    $ 1,476    $ 11,469    $ 13,893            Total     $ 10,425    $ 4,612    $ 533    $ 3,665    $ 19,235    $ 23,539              (a) Fixed maturity securities primarily includes available-for-sale and trading securities reported at fair value of $9.6 billion ($9.6 billion amortized cost), and $0.8 billion ($0.8 billion amortized cost), respectively. Covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and which have full recourse to the issuing bank) represented approximately 10 percent of the $10.4 billion fixed maturity securities.  (b) Cash and short-term investments include bank deposit placements, operating accounts, securities purchased under agreements to resell and collateral posted to counterparties against structured products. Credit equivalent exposure to securities purchased under agreements to resell was $102 million (notional value of $3.2 billion).  (c) Derivative transactions are reported at fair value.  (d) Other primarily consists of commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures ($0.8 billion) and captive risk management programs in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands ($1.4 billion).   Out of a total of $4.3 billion of fixed maturity securities issued by banks in the Euro-Zone countries, AIG's subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $972 million and $334 million, respectively, at September 30, 2012. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.  169      The following table presents further detail on AIG's fixed maturity security exposure to banks in the United Kingdom and Europe:                                                                                         September 30, 2012   Fixed Maturity Securities(a)           (in millions)      Secured/ Government(b)      Senior      Subordinated      Tier 1      Total      December 31, 2011            Euro-Zone countries:                                          Netherlands     $ 511    $ 1,078    $ 319    $ 126    $ 2,034    $ 2,157      France       136      245      288      100      769      845      Germany       125      156      220      68      569      765      Spain       153      240      69      40      502      582      Italy       74      54      64      –      192      253      Austria       116      23      –      –      139      182      Belgium       43      36      12      –      91      171      Other Euro-Zone       5      28      –      –      33      149            Total Euro-Zone     $ 1,163    $ 1,860    $ 972    $ 334    $ 4,329    $ 5,104            Remainder of Europe                                          United Kingdom     $ 187    $ 1,321    $ 1,965    $ 384    $ 3,857    $ 4,282      Switzerland       28      565      303      4      900      1,027      Sweden       206      435      148      84      873      760      Other remainder of Europe       282      146      2      36      466      429            Total remainder of Europe     $ 703    $ 2,467    $ 2,418    $ 508    $ 6,096    $ 6,498            Total     $ 1,866    $ 4,327    $ 3,390    $ 842    $ 10,425    $ 11,602              (a) Fixed maturity securities primarily includes available for sale and trading securities reported at fair value and single name CDS protection sold at notional contract value.  (b) Secured/government primarily includes covered bonds and securities issued by government-sponsored entities or debt guaranteed by a government.   Approximately 80 percent of the fixed maturity securities of United Kingdom and European non-financial institutions held by AIG were considered investment grade based on AIG's internal ratings. Apart from ILFC equipment leased under operating leases to airlines, non-financial institution corporate exposure to Euro-Zone countries totaled $18.7 billion, with France representing the largest single country exposure of $6.5 billion. $10.6 billion of the Euro-Zone exposures were fixed maturity securities of which $2.5 billion was in France. Approximately two-thirds of the French exposures were to issuers in the oil and gas, rail, utilities and telecommunications industries. Euro-Zone fixed maturity securities represented 29 percent of total non-financial institution corporate exposure in the United Kingdom and Europe. Euro-Zone periphery non-financial institution corporate exposures ($5.1 billion) are heavily weighted towards large multinational corporations or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (25 percent), telecommunications (17 percent), and oil and gas (9 percent).  170      The following table presents AIG's aggregate credit exposures to non-financial institutions in the United Kingdom and Europe:                                                                                                    Fixed Maturity(a)(b)                  December 31, 2011 Total       (in millions)      Secured      Senior      Total      Derivatives      Other(c)      Total            September 30, 2012                                                Euro-Zone countries:                                                France     $ 46    $ 2,501    $ 2,547    $ 1,097    $ 2,889    $ 6,533    $ 6,791      Germany       45      2,405      2,450      37      943      3,430      3,811      Spain       8      1,131      1,139      –      902      2,041      2,259      Italy       23      1,222      1,245      17      715      1,977      1,742      Netherlands       33      1,286      1,319      –      587      1,906      2,387      Ireland       –      747      747      –      71      818      792      Belgium       2      578      580      –      202      782      785      Luxembourg       5      259      264      –      358      622      665      Other Euro-Zone       21      261      282      –      335      617      777            Total Euro-Zone     $ 183    $ 10,390    $ 10,573    $ 1,151    $ 7,002    $ 18,726    $ 20,009            Remainder of Europe:                                                United Kingdom       283      6,893      7,176      561      6,119      13,856      13,622      Switzerland       120      1,633      1,753      –      266      2,019      1,899      Other remainder of Europe       310      1,094      1,404      –      651      2,055      1,472            Total remainder of Europe     $ 713    $ 9,620    $ 10,333    $ 561    $ 7,036    $ 17,930    $ 16,993            Total     $ 896    $ 20,010    $ 20,906    $ 1,712    $ 14,038    $ 36,656    $ 37,002              (a) Fixed maturity securities primarily include available-for-sale securities, with $246 million in trading securities.  (b) United Kingdom and European exposure also consists of $308 million of subordinated debt, primarily in the United Kingdom and Spain; bank loans of $85 million; and preferred equity securities of $40 million.  (c) Other primarily consists of insurance related products, including captive fronting programs ($7.5 billion), trade credit insurance ($3.4 billion) and surety insurance ($2.0 billion).   AIG also had credit exposures to several European governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in the recent past by one or more of the major rating agencies. These downgrades occurred mostly in countries in the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy and Portugal) where AIG's credit exposures totaled $266 million at September 30, 2012. The downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits, rising government debt-to-GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these sovereigns, which have given rise to widening credit spreads and difficult financing conditions. These credit exposures primarily included available-for-sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. AIG had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece or Ireland.  AIG's aggregate credit exposure to the government of Japan was $9.3 billion at September 30, 2012. A significant majority of these securities were held in the investment portfolios of AIG's Japanese insurance operations.  171      The following table presents AIG's aggregate (gross and net) credit exposures to non-U.S. governments:                                             (in millions)     September 30, 2012     December 31, 2011            Euro-Zone countries:                  Germany     $ 1,364   $ 1,854      France       996     1,157      Netherlands       450     442      Austria       160     203      Spain       156     228      Finland       135     87      Belgium       130     139      Italy       106     108      Portugal       4     3      Other Euro-Zone       10     –            Total Euro-Zone       3,511     4,221            Other concentrations:                  Japan       9,268     9,205      Canada       2,784     3,153      United Kingdom       802     1,615      Australia       711     879      China       514     132      Mexico       477     507      Russia       418     293      Norway       341     720      Qatar       324     339      Brazil       317     306      Other       4,620     4,801            Total other concentrations       20,576     21,950            Total     $ 24,087   $ 26,171             AIG also had United Kingdom and European structured product exposures (largely residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities) totaling $6.8 billion at September 30, 2012. United Kingdom structured products accounted for $4 billion, or 59 percent, of these exposures, while the Netherlands and Germany comprised 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the Euro-Zone periphery accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 90 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at September 30, 2012 based on external rating agency ratings.  In addition, AIG had commercial real estate-related net equity investments in Europe totaling $478 million and related unfunded commitments of $156 million.  ILFC's fleet includes aircraft on operating leases to United Kingdom and European airlines with a net book value of approximately $11.9 billion, of which approximately $2.7 billion, or 22 percent, are aircraft on lease to carriers based in the five Euro-Zone periphery countries.  AIG actively monitors its European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the Euro-Zone periphery, and uses various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine whether mitigating actions should be taken. Mitigating actions in these areas to date have largely included non-renewal of maturing exposures and sales and tenders of securities. To date, AIG's purchases of credit default swap protection have been minimal. The financial condition of issuers is periodically evaluated, and internal risk ratings are adjusted as circumstances warrant. The result of these continuing reviews has led AIG to believe that its combined credit risk exposures to sovereign governments, financial institutions and non-financial corporations in the Euro-Zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers.  172               AIG also monitors its aggregate cross-border exposures by country and regional group of countries. AIG includes in its cross-border exposures both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and its cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries. Five countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2012 compared to six countries at December 31, 2011. Based on AIG's internal risk ratings, at September 30, 2012, three countries were rated AAA and two were rated AA. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and France.  AIG also has a risk concentration, primarily through the investment portfolios of its insurance companies, in the U.S. municipal sector. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of AIG's domestic property and casualty insurance companies. See Investments – Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. AIG had $606 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of its insurance company portfolios at September 30, 2012, compared to $892 million at December 31, 2011. These exposures consisted of AIGFP derivatives and trading securities (at fair value) and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.  AIG reviews regularly concentration reports in all categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. AIG periodically adjusts limits and reviews exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that it does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that AIG's credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.      Market Risk Management        Insurance and Aircraft Leasing Sensitivities     The following table provides estimates of AIG's sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                                                     Exposure          Effect       (dollars in millions)     September 30, 2012     December 31, 2011*     Sensitivity Factor     September 30, 2012     December 31, 2011            Yield sensitive assets     $ 331,500    $ 326,200     100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves      $ (15,700   )  $ (15,800 )    Equity and alternative investments exposure      $ 32,700    $ 39,000     20% decline in stock prices and value of alternative investments      $ (6,500   )  $ (7,800 )    Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure      $ 8,400    $ 5,900     10% depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar      $ (800   )  $ (590 )           Exposures to yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements, such as fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables, receivables from aircraft equipment under leases, and short-term investments (excluding consolidated separate account assets). Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds (excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds). Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect AIG's consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis.   •Total yield sensitive assets increased 1.6 percent, or approximately $5.3 billion, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to a net increase in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of $6.3 billion, partially offset by a decrease in cash equivalents of $959 million.  •Total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 15.9 percent, or approximately $6.3 billion, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to a decrease of $6.2 billion related to AIG's sale of AIA equity securities as well as decreases in other common equity securities of $629 million, mutual fund values of $128 million and other equity investments of $11 million. The decrease was partially offset by increases in partnership values of $532 million and real estate investments of $261 million.  •Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 42.4 percent, or $2.5 billion, compared to December 31, 2011. This was primarily due to an increase in British pound exposure of $1.8 billion from changes in Chartis Europe's foreign currency exchange hedging and investment strategy. Other increases include Euro exposure of $443 million as a result of a reduction in euro-denominated debt outstanding of $231 million, an additional purchase of AIRE investment of $109 million, positive results from operations at Chartis Europe SA of $103 million,  173      and changes in Canadian-dollar denominated unearned premium reserves of $378 million. This was partially offset by a net decrease across currencies of $67 million.  The above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes. The selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events. These scenarios should not be construed as the only risks AIG faces; these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses AIG could experience. In addition, losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated. The sensitivity factors are the same as those used in the 2011 Annual Report.      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.  The accounting policies that AIG believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:  •income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;  •recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs, flight equipment, and reinsurance;   •insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;  •estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;  •impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments of financial instruments and goodwill impairments;  •liabilities for legal contingencies; and •fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.  These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. The following is a discussion of 2012 updates to Critical Accounting Estimates included in the 2011 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of AIG's critical accounting estimates, see the 2011 Annual Report.      Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset:     The evaluation of the recoverability of AIG's deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.  See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax asset.      Recoverability of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs – Short-Duration (AIG Property Casualty):     Recoverability of DAC is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months for short-duration insurance contracts. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.  For short-duration insurance contracts, starting on January 1, 2012, AIG elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable. AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy because it  174      includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.  AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on inforce business to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses, anticipated policy maintenance costs and unamortized DAC. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge. Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income for AIG Property Casualty exceeded the sum of these costs at September 30, 2012.  On January 1, 2012, AIG adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The adoption of this standard resulted in a $5.1 billion decrease in the January 1, 2012 consolidated DAC balance.      Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities:     See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and AIG's accounting policy for the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.     Overview     The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                         September 30, 2012   (in billions)      Fair Value     Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 278     93 %    Fair value based on internal sources     20     7            Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 298     100 %            (a) Includes $28.7 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.      Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  The following table presents the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 3:                                                    (in billions)     September 30, 2012     Percentage of Total      December 31, 2011      Percentage of Total            Assets     $ 41.7       7.6 % $ 39.4     7.1 %    Liabilities       4.6       1.0     5.3     1.2             175      Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. AIG considers unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular unobservable input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.  AIG classifies fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.    Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio     The entities included in Global Capital Markets operations wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt, and prime residential mortgages. In these transactions, AIG is at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets. To a lesser extent, those entities also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer, primarily in respect of regulatory capital relief transactions.  The following table presents the net notional amount, fair value of derivative (asset) liability and unrealized market valuation gain (loss) of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions, by asset class:                                                               Unrealized Market Valuation Gain (Loss)(c)                   Fair Value of Derivative (Asset) Liability at(b)(c)             Net Notional Amount(a)      Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,            September 30, 2012      December 31, 2011     September 30, 2012      December 31, 2011                   (in millions)     2012      2011     2012      2011            Regulatory Capital:                                                      Corporate loans     $ 898    $ 1,830     $ –    $ –     $ –    $ –     $ –    $ –      Prime residential mortgages        139      3,653       –      –       –      –       –      6      Other       –      887       –      9       6      (10 )     9      –            Total       1,037      6,370       –      9       6      (10 )     9      6            Arbitrage:                                                      Multi-sector CDOs(d)       4,363      5,476       2,183      3,077       142      47       336      230      Corporate debt/CLOs(e)       11,707      11,784       74      127       42      (33 )     53      11            Total       16,070      17,260       2,257      3,204       184      14       389      241            Mezzanine tranches       –      989       –      10       14      (1 )     3      (15 )          Total     $ 17,107    $ 24,619     $ 2,257    $ 3,223     $ 204    $ 3     $ 401    $ 232              (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.  (b) Fair value amounts are shown before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral.  (c) Includes credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) of $(12) million and $25 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $(36) million and $27 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, representing the effect of changes in AIG's credit spreads on the valuation of the derivatives liabilities.  (d) During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, a super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $470 million was terminated at approximately its fair value at the time of termination. As a result, a $416 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, $142 million was paid to counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Upon payment, a $142 million loss, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss, was realized. Multi-sector CDOs also include $3.7 billion and $4.6 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.  (e) Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.2 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.   176      The following table presents changes in the net notional amount of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, including credit default swaps written on mezzanine tranches of certain regulatory capital relief transactions:                                                                      (in millions)      Net Notional Amount December 31, 2011(a)   Terminations   Maturities   Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates(b)   Amortization   Net Notional Amount September 30, 2012(a)            Regulatory Capital:                                          Corporate loans   $ 1,830   $ –   $ (16 ) $ (8 ) $ (908 )   $ 898      Prime residential mortgages      3,653     (2,360 )   (3 )   41     (1,192 )     139      Other     887     (754 )   –     11     (144 )     –            Total     6,370     (3,114 )   (19 )   44     (2,244 )     1,037            Arbitrage:                                          Multi-sector CDOs(c)     5,476     (470 )   –     (14 )   (629 )     4,363      Corporate debt/CLOs(d)     11,784     –     –     (51 )   (26 )     11,707            Total     17,260     (470 )   –     (65 )   (655 )     16,070            Mezzanine tranches     989     (985 )   –     (4 )   –       –            Total   $ 24,619   $ (4,569 ) $ (19 ) $ (25 ) $ (2,899 )   $ 17,107             (a) Net notional amounts presented are net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches.

(d) Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.2 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  The following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the super senior credit default swap portfolio (prior to offsets for other transactions) as of the periods ended:                                          (in millions)     September 30, 2012      December 31, 2011            Regulatory capital     $ –   $ 9      Arbitrage – multi-sector CDO       1,827     2,711      Arbitrage – corporate       445     477            Total     $ 2,272   $ 3,197                 Regulatory Capital Portfolio     During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, $3.1 billion in net notional amount of regulatory capital CDSs were terminated or matured at no cost. The expected maturity of this portfolio continues to be monitored. As of September 30, 2012, the estimated weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was less than one year. There have been no requirements to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. The regulatory benefit of these transactions for financial institution counterparties was generally derived from Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions, and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In prior years, it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from Basel I to an intermediate standard known as Basel II, which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions, at the end of 2009. Basel III has now superseded Basel II, but the details of its implementation by the various European Central Banking districts have not been finalized. Should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions, those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame.  177      In light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data, to the extent deemed relevant and available, AIG determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2012 other than for transactions where Global Capital Markets believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief. Although AIG believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties, the counterparties' early termination rights, and the expectation that such rights will be exercised, preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions.      Arbitrage Portfolio     A portion of the super senior credit default swaps as of September 30, 2012 are arbitrage-motivated transactions written on multi-sector CDOs or designated pools of investment grade senior unsecured corporate debt or CLOs.    Multi-Sector CDOs  The following table summarizes gross transaction notional amount of the multi-sector CDOs on which protection was written on the super senior tranche, subordination below the super senior risk layer, net notional amount and fair value of derivative liability by underlying collateral type:                               September 30, 2012      (in millions)      Gross Transaction Notional Amount(a)   Subordination Below the Super Senior Risk Layer   Net Notional Amount   Fair Value of Derivative Liability            High grade with subprime collateral   $ 2,311   $ 1,183   $ 1,128   $ 461      High grade with no subprime collateral      2,732     1,126     1,606     583            Total high grade(b)     5,043     2,309     2,734     1,044            Mezzanine with subprime collateral     1,841     528     1,313     945      Mezzanine with no subprime collateral      594     278     316     194            Total mezzanine(c)     2,435     806     1,629     1,139            Total   $ 7,478   $ 3,115   $ 4,363   $ 2,183              (a) Total outstanding principal amount of securities held by a CDO.  (b) "High grade" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand-alone basis were predominantly AA or higher at origination.  (c) "Mezzanine" refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand-alone basis were predominantly A or lower at origination.     Corporate Debt/CLOs  The corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of CDS written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the CDS. These CDS transactions require cash settlement. This portfolio also includes CDS with a net notional amount of $1.2 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of CLOs, which require physical settlement.      Valuation Sensitivity – Arbitrage Portfolio       Multi-Sector CDOs  AIG utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on AIG's calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio. While AIG believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable, given the current difficult market conditions, AIG is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur. As recent experience demonstrates, actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios, and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses. On average, prices for CDOs increased during 2012. Further, it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions.  178               For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Out of the total $4.4 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at September 30, 2012, a BET value is available for $2.8 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.6 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs as prices on the underlying securities held by the CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $2.8 billion.  The most significant assumption used in the BET model is the estimated price of the securities within the CDO collateral pools. If the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio, there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate. Any declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a CDO will similarly affect the value of the super senior CDO securities. While the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a CDO, the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile, especially given current market conditions. AIG cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a CDO at this time.  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at September 30, 2012 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                         Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability            Average Inputs Used at September 30, 2012           (dollars in millions)   Change   Entire Portfolio   RMBS Prime   RMBS Alt-A   RMBS Subprime   CMBS   CDOs   Other              Bond prices   39 points   Increase of 5 points   $ (163 ) $ (2 ) $ (11 ) $ (80 ) $ (44 ) $ (17 ) $ (9 )              Decrease of 5 points     154     3     11     67     45     15     13            Weighted       Increase of 1 year     21     1     –     16     2     2     –      average life   5.80 years   Decrease of 1 year     (33 )   (1 )   –     (28 )   (3 )   (1 )   –              Recovery rates   17%   Increase of 10%     (16 )   –     (3 )   (10 )   (2 )   –     (1 )              Decrease of 10%     17     –     2     11     2     1     1            Diversity score(a)   13   Increase of 5     (5 )                                               Decrease of 5     14                                                  Discount curve(b)   N/A   Increase of 100bps     14                                                  (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible.  (b) The discount curve is an input at the CDO level. A calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible. Furthermore, for this input it is not possible to disclose a weighted average input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points.   These results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption. No assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed, perhaps significantly, the ranges assumed by AIG for purposes of the above analysis. No assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above.      REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT     In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, AIG's regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation in the 2011 Annual Report.  AIG's operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad.      Federal Reserve Supervision     As a result of the completion of the September 14, 2012 registered public offering of AIG Common Stock, the Department of the Treasury ceased to own a majority of the outstanding shares of AIG Common Stock, and, consequently, AIG is regulated and subject to the examination, supervision and enforcement authority and reporting  179      requirements of the FRB (as successor to the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)) as an SLHC. Because AIG was grandfathered as a unitary SLHC in1999, AIG generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, as long as AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) dissolved the OTS and transferred its functions and personnel to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FRB. Supervision of federal savings associations, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank, has been transferred to the OCC, and supervision of SLHCs has been transferred to the FRB. Elements of Dodd-Frank also align the regulation of SLHCs more closely to that of bank holding companies, and the FRB is taking additional steps to do so under both Dodd-Frank and the FRB's supervisory and rulemaking authority over SLHCs. Changes mandated by Dodd-Frank include directing the FRB to promulgate minimum capital requirements for SLHCs. In addition, the FRB, as the primary supervisor for SLHC's has the authority to impose enhanced prudential standards on SLHCs.  The FRB, OCC and FDIC have proposed revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements that would apply to all bank holding companies and SLHCs, as well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. As required by Dodd-Frank, the FRB has also proposed enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding company and nonbank SIFIs and has stated its intention to propose enhanced prudential standards for SLHCs pursuant to the Home Owners' Loan Act. The proposed regulations are described below. AIG cannot predict whether the capital regulations will be adopted as proposed or what enhanced prudential standards the FRB will promulgate for SLHCs, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses. Further, AIG cannot predict how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over AIG, although the FRB could, as a prudential matter, for example, limit AIG's ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its common stock or acquire or enter into other businesses. AIG cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact AIG's businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or require AIG to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of AIG's credit ratings.  In addition, Dodd-Frank requires SIFIs to be subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the FRB (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements). Nonbank SIFIs will be designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) created by Dodd-Frank. If AIG is designated as a SIFI, AIG will be regulated by the FRB both in that capacity and in its capacity as an SLHC. The regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other. In October 2012, AIG received a notice that it is under consideration by the Council for a proposed determination that it is a SIFI. The notice stated that AIG will be reviewed in Stage 3 of the SIFI determination process described in the Council's interpretive guidance for nonbank financial company determinations.      Volcker Rule     In July 2012, Section 619 of Dodd-Frank, referred to as the "Volcker Rule," became effective though the final rule implementing Section 619 has not yet been released. Under the proposed rule released in October 2011, if AIG continues to control AIG Federal Savings Bank, AIG and its affiliates are considered banking entities for purposes of the rule and, after the rule's conformance date of July 21, 2014, would be prohibited from "proprietary trading" and sponsoring or investing in "covered funds," subject to the rule's exceptions. Even if AIG no longer controlled an insured depository institution, it could be subject to restrictions on these activities if it is designated as a SIFI, as Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to capital requirements, quantitative limits or other restrictions if they engage in activities prohibited for banking entities under the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, as proposed, contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account, but the final breadth and scope of this exemption is uncertain.      Capital Requirements     Before Dodd-Frank, the OTS did not subject SLHCs to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. Section 171 of Dodd-Frank, the so-called "Collins Amendment," subjects SLHCs to capital requirements that are not less stringent than the requirements generally applicable to insured depository institutions or quantitatively lower than the requirements in effect for insured depository institutions as of July 21, 2010.  180      The regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank, are computed in accordance with the U.S. federal banking agencies' generally applicable risk-based capital requirements, which are based on accords established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). These accords have evolved over time, and are referred to as Basel I, Basel II and Basel III.  In June 2012, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies proposed modifications to their existing capital adequacy regulations to address both the Collins Amendment and Basel III. The FRB would apply these revised capital adequacy regulations to SLHCs upon the effective date of the regulations, which is proposed to be January 1, 2013, matching the international Basel III phase-in calendar. The federal banking agencies have also proposed to replace their existing Basel I-based rules for determining risk weighted assets (RWAs), a component of capital ratios, with a Basel II-based version to make them more risk-sensitive. This proposal to implement the Basel II standardized approach (with modifications) would take effect on January 1, 2015.  Under the Collins Amendment and the proposed rules, the Basel II standardized approach or, prior to the change, current bank capital rules, would serve as a floor for determining RWAs and resulting capital ratios for institutions subject to the advanced approaches. Under the proposed rules, AIG would be subject to the advanced approaches and would be required to begin their implementation, subject to a parallel run period.  If the revised capital adequacy rules are adopted as proposed, they will become effective on January 1, 2013, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. On January 1, 2019, the rules will require:  •a minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to RWAs of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% "capital conservation buffer" (which is added to the 4.5% Tier 1 common equity ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to RWAs of at least 7%);   •a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to RWAs of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation);   •a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to RWAs of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation);   •for advanced approaches institutions, a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average balance sheet exposures plus certain average off-balance sheet exposures; and  •a "countercyclical capital buffer" applicable only to institutions subject to the advanced approaches, generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a Tier 1 common equity add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% and if applied (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).  The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to RWAs above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when and if the latter is applied) will face progressive constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and certain executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. As proposed, the capital buffer would phase in at 0.625% per year beginning on January 1, 2016 until it reaches its 2.5% fully phased in level on January 1, 2019.  Also in June 2012, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies issued revised final rules that modify their market risk regulatory capital requirements for banking institutions with significant trading activities. These modifications are designed to address the adjustments to the market risk regulatory capital framework that were announced by the Basel Committee in June 2010 (referred to as "Basel II.5"), as well as the prohibition on the use of external credit ratings, as required by Dodd-Frank. These changes will also be implemented in January 2013 and will result in increased regulatory capital requirements for market risk.  If the rules are adopted as proposed, AIG will be required to meet the following initial minimum capital ratios on January 1, 2013:  •3.5% Tier 1 common equity to RWAs;  •4.5% Tier 1 capital to RWAs; and •8.0% Total capital to RWAs.  181      Although AIG is still considering the full impact of these capital requirements, AIG believes that, if the FRB's proposed rules become effective and apply to AIG as an SLHC, it will meet all revised minimum capital requirements as of January 1, 2013.  The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to Tier 1 common equity, which will begin on January 1, 2014 and will be phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The Basel Committee has also published its final provisions for assessing the global systemic importance of banking institutions and the range of additional Tier 1 common equity that should be maintained by banking institutions deemed to be globally systemically important. The additional capital for these institutions would initially range from 1% to 2.5% of Tier 1 common equity and could be as much as 3.5%. AIG was not one of the institutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (established at the direction of the leaders of the Group of 20) as a global systemically important bank under the Basel Committee's methodology. The final determination of whether an institution will be classified as a global systemically important bank and the calculation of the required additional capital amount is expected to be disclosed by the Basel Committee no later than November 2014 based on data through the end of 2013. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has proposed an assessment methodology for identifying global systemically important insurance companies, which could also be subject to additional capital requirements, and has committed to make its final recommendations to the Financing Stability Board by March 2013.  In June 2012, the Basel Committee also released a consultation paper proposing approaches for calculating incremental capital requirements for domestic systemically important banks. The recommendation is complementary to the framework outlined above for global systemically important banks, but is more principles-based in order to provide an appropriate degree of national discretion. These proposals may impact the regulatory capital requirements of AIG, but the exact impact will depend on the final framework and how it is implemented by the U.S. federal banking agencies, both in general and as specifically applied to insurance companies.  In May 2012, the Basel Committee released a consultation paper proposing a "Fundamental Review of the Trading Book." The paper proposes a series of comprehensive changes to the regulatory capital requirements for market risk which, if enacted by the U.S. federal banking agencies, would likely replace the Basel II.5 requirements that, as outlined above, become effective in January 2013.      Heightened Prudential Standards     In January 2012, the FRB published for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements mandated by Dodd-Frank that will apply to large bank holding companies and SIFIs. If those rules are adopted in the form proposed and AIG is designated as a SIFI, AIG would be required, among other things,   •to calculate AIG's minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements, each as if it were a bank holding company;  •to submit annually to the FRB for approval a capital plan detailing AIG's projected capital distributions and demonstrating that it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a ratio of Basel I Tier 1 common equity to RWAs currently of at least 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressed conditions throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan;  •to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets of 5.0% under both expected and stressed conditions in order to be able to engage in capital distributions;  •to comply with additional liquidity-related requirements, such as to produce comprehensive cash flow projections, to regularly stress test cash flow projections, to maintain a liquidity buffer of highly liquid assets that are unencumbered, to establish and maintain a contingency funding plan for liquidity stress events, and to establish or maintain limits on potential sources of liquidity risk;  •not to have aggregate net credit exposure to any single unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25 percent of AIG's consolidated capital stock and surplus, or 10 percent if the counterparty has $500 billion or more in total consolidated assets;  •to be subject to an annual stress test conducted by the FRB and annual and semi-annual self-administered stress tests;  182       •to be subject to early remediation actions upon occurrence of trigger events (such as failure to maintain the capital that is commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which AIG is exposed, or non-compliance with the FRB's stress test), which early remediation actions could vary from heightened supervisory review by the FRB to an FRB-recommended resolution of AIG, based on the seriousness of the trigger events;  •to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio, measured by "total liabilities" and "total equity capital", of no more than 15-to-1 upon a determination by the Council that (i) the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United States and (ii) the imposition of such requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that such company poses to the financial stability of the United States; and •to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, such as additional responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the creation of a separate risk committee of the Board of Directors.  In addition, certain of Dodd-Frank's stress test requirements will separately apply to AIG as an SLHC irrespective of whether AIG is designated as a SIFI.  The notice of proposed rulemaking did not include the requirements that will apply to SLHCs, which will be proposed in a separate notice. AIG cannot predict whether there will be significant differences between the requirements for large bank holding companies and SIFIs and the requirements for SLHCs, or whether the requirements for SLHCs will have specific provisions for companies in the insurance business.      Other Effects of Dodd-Frank     In addition, Dodd-Frank will also have the following effects on AIG:  •If AIG is designated as a SIFI, the FRB could (i) limit AIG's ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company, to offer specified financial products or to terminate specified activities; (ii) impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; or (iii) with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require AIG to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities. •If AIG is designated as a SIFI, AIG must periodically report to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. If the regulators determine that AIG's resolution plan is not credible, they may impose restrictions on AIG including additional capital requirements or limits on growth.  In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the IAIS to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles. IAIS Insurance Core Principles form the baseline threshold for how countries' financial services regulatory efforts are measured relative to the insurance sector. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which AIG's subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority. In July 2012, the IAIS released a working draft of its Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, which provides for global, coordinated supervision of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs). AIG is likely to be designated an IAIG.  AIG cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on AIG's business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings.  183                        ITEM 3. / QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Included in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Enterprise Risk Management.          ITEM 4. / CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG's management, with the participation of AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2012.  There has been no change in AIG's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG's internal control over financial reporting.  184                    PART II — OTHER INFORMATION             ITEM 1 / LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.          ITEM 1A. / RISK FACTORS       In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of AIG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2012 and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and discussed throughout Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on February 27, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively, and throughout Exhibit 99.2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2012 (collectively, the 2011 Annual Report).      REGULATION     Our status as a savings and loan holding company and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, either or both of which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings.  As a result of the completion of the September 14, 2012 registered public offering of AIG Common Stock, the Department of the Treasury ceased to own a majority of the outstanding shares of AIG Common Stock, and, consequently, AIG is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and subject to its examination, supervision and enforcement authority and reporting requirements as a savings and loan holding company (SLHC). The FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have proposed revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements that would apply to all bank holding companies and SLHCs, as well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. As a result of our regulation by the FRB as an SLHC:  •We cannot predict how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us.   •The FRB, as a prudential matter, may limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of AIG Common Stock.  In addition, under Dodd-Frank we may separately become subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (SIFI). In October 2012, AIG received a notice that it is under consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) for a proposed determination that it is a SIFI. The notice stated that AIG will be reviewed in Stage 3 of the SIFI determination process described in the Council's interpretive guidance for nonbank financial company determinations. If we are designated as a SIFI:  •We would become subject to stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions.  185       •We would be subject to stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress.  •We would become subject to a new early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.  If we are designated as a SIFI and determined to be a "grave threat" to U.S. financial stability:  •We would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1.   •The FRB may:      •limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;   •restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;   •require us to terminate specified activities;   •impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; or   •with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.    The regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other.  See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – Regulation for further discussion of this potential regulation.  If we continue to control AIG Federal Savings Bank or another insured depository institution, as of July 21, 2014, we will be required to conform to the "Volcker Rule", which prohibits "proprietary trading" and the sponsoring or investing in "covered funds." The term "covered funds" includes hedge, private equity or similar funds and, in certain cases, issuers of asset backed securities if such securities have equity-like characteristics. These prohibitions could substantially impact our investment portfolios as they are currently managed. The Volcker Rule, as proposed, contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account, but the final breadth and scope of this exemption cannot be predicted. Even if AIG no longer controlled an insured depository institution, Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to additional capital and quantitative limitations if they engage in activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule.  In addition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for regulation of over the counter (OTC) derivatives under which we may have to collateralize previously uncollateralized swaps. These additional obligations to post collateral or the costs of assignment, termination or obtaining alternative credit could have a material adverse effect on us. This new framework may also increase the cost of conducting a hedging program or have other effects materially adverse to us.  We cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. It is possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank and our regulation by the FRB as an SLHC could significantly alter our business practices, require us to raise additional capital, impose burdensome and costly requirements and add additional costs. Some of the regulations may also affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our financial strength and could potentially affect our financing costs or result in a ratings downgrade.  186              ITEM 2 / UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS     During the third quarter of 2012, the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, closed the sale of 825,447,665 shares in the aggregate of AIG Common Stock in two separate offerings, at an average initial public offering price of $31.72 per share. In connection with these offerings, AIG's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock with an aggregate purchase amount of up to $8.0 billion. AIG purchased shares of AIG Common Stock in these offerings at the initial offering prices summarized below, for an aggregate purchase amount of approximately $8.0 billion.  The following table sets forth the information with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of AIG or any "affiliated purchaser" (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of AIG Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2012:                                Period   Total Number of Shares Repurchased   Average Price Paid per Share   Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs   Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in millions)              July 1 - 31     –   $ –     –   $ –      August 1 - 31     98,360,656     30.50     98,360,656     –        September 1 - 30     153,846,153     32.50     153,846,153     –            Total     252,206,809   $ 31.72     252,206,809   $ –                     ITEM 4 / MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES     Not applicable.
