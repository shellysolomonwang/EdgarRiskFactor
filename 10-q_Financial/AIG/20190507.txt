Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “generally accepted accounting principles” in the United States. The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. These measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Book value per common share, excluding AOCI, is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Return on common equity – Adjusted after-tax income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders’ equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted return on common equity. Adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity. The reconciliation to return on common equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A. Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (APTI) adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG: · deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;  · changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and · net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act); and by excluding the net realized capital gains (losses) from noncontrolling interests.  We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this MD&A. Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our operating segments.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 63       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Measures     Adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:    · changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits; · changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; · changes in the fair value of equity securities; · loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; · all net realized capital gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized capital gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);  · income or loss from discontinued operations; · net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);   · pension expense related to a one-time lump sum payment to former employees; · income and loss from divested businesses;  · non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; · restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;  · the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain; · integration and transaction costs associated with acquired businesses; · losses from the impairment of goodwill; and · non-recurring external costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles.    · General Insurance – Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. – Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural and man-made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results. · Life and Retirement – Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding agreements and mutual funds. Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.      64 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Critical Accounting Estimates       Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:     · loss reserves; · reinsurance assets; · valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; · valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; · valuation of embedded derivatives for fixed index annuity and life products; · estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; · impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment; · allowances for loan losses; · liability for legal contingencies; · fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; and · income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and estimates associated with the Tax Act.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.  For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2018 Annual Report.      Executive Summary  Overview This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in our securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2018 Annual Report, in their entirety for a more detailed description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, on a prospective basis, the changes in the fair value of equity securities are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income (loss).

These increases were more than offset by: • higher net realized capital losses;  • a net loss reserve discount charge in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a loss reserve discount benefit in the first quarter of 2018; and • the impact of noncontrolling interest attributed to Fortitude Re results in the first quarter of 2019 as discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations. For further discussion see Consolidated Results of Operations.      Adjusted Pre-Tax Income* Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)            2019 and 2018 Comparison Increase in Adjusted pre-tax income primarily due to: • higher investment returns in our hedge fund portfolio due to robust equity market returns in the first quarter of 2019 and an increase in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected, compared to the same period in the prior year where returns were lower as a result of an increase in rates and widening spreads that occurred, as well as negative performance of our fair value option equity securities portfolio; • lower general operating and other expenses; and • a General Insurance underwriting profit in the first quarter of 2019 compared to an underwriting loss in the same period in the prior year driven by lower catastrophe losses and lower accident year losses as a result of underwriting discipline, increased use of reinsurance and a change in business mix.            * Non-GAAP measure – for reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP measures see Consolidated Results of Operations.      AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 67       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary       General Operating and Other Expenses Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison General operating and other expenses declined primarily due to lower employee related expenses and professional fee reductions pertaining to ongoing efficiency programs. The declines were partially offset due to the increase in expenses caused by the acquisitions of Validus and Glatfelter in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively. In keeping with our broad and ongoing efforts to transform for long-term competitiveness, general operating and other expenses for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 included approximately $47 million and $24 million of pre-tax restructuring and other costs, respectively, which were primarily comprised of employee severance charges and other exit costs related to organizational simplification, operational efficiency, and business rationalization.

We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2019, characterized by factors such as the impact of historically low interest rates, uncertainties in the annuity marketplace resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at re-evaluating the standard of care for sales of investment products and services, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, global trade tensions and the UK’s pending withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time. Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment Interest rates in 2019 have remained low by historical standards, notwithstanding that interest rates rose in 2018, and in some cases have risen close to highs of the preceding five to ten years. In early 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System indicated that it expects the pace of rate increases to slow. The low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. As rates rise, some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts, some of which are highlighted below. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities. Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.  Annuity Sales and Surrenders The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting, tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio. Reinvestment and Spread Management We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. A low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments. For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable,    AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 69       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. As interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment. Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 63 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at March 31, 2019. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 65 percent and 66 percent at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 65 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at March 31, 2019.

General Insurance The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. Sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.   70 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Executive Summary    In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance Run-Off Lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.  Standard of Care Developments The SEC, federal and state lawmakers and state insurance regulators continue their efforts at evaluating what is an appropriate regulatory framework around a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services. For example, on April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretations designed to address the standard of care issues and the transparency of retail investors’ relationships with investment advisors and broker-dealers. Additionally, on July 18, 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted a best interest standard of care regulation applicable to annuity and life transactions through issuance of the First Amendment to Insurance Regulation 187 – Suitability and Best Interests in Life Insurance and Annuity Transactions (Regulation 187). The compliance date for Regulation 187 is August 1, 2019 for annuity products and February 1, 2020 for life products. As amended, Regulation 187 requires producers to act in their client’s best interest when making point-of-sale and in-force recommendations, and provide in writing the basis for the recommendation, as well as the facts and analysis to support the recommendation. The amended regulation also imposes additional duties on life insurance companies in relation to these transactions, such as requiring insurers to establish and maintain procedures designed to prevent financial exploitation and abuse. We will implement and enhance processes and procedures, where needed, to comply with this regulation. Other states, such as Nevada, Maryland and New Jersey, have also proposed similar standard of care regulations applicable to insurance producers and/or insurance companies. We continue to closely follow these proposals and other relevant federal and state-level regulatory and legislative developments in this area. While we cannot predict the long-term impact of these developments on our Life and Retirement businesses, we believe our diverse product offerings and distribution relationships position us to compete effectively in this evolving marketplace. Impact of Currency Volatility Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability. General Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the Major Currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses:     Three Months Ended March 31,               Percentage         Rate for 1 USD       2019   2018       Change         Currency:                             GBP       0.78   0.73       7   %     EUR       0.88   0.82       7   %     JPY       110.50   110.62       -   %    Unless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the General Insurance discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the Major Currencies included in the preceding table. Other Industry Developments On September 7, 2017, the UK Ministry of Justice announced a proposal to increase the Ogden rate from negative 0.75 percent to between zero and one percent. Following this announcement, on December 20, 2018 the UK Parliament passed the Civil Liability Act 2018 which implements a new framework for determining the Ogden rate and requires the UK Ministry of Justice to start a review of the Ogden rate within 90 days of its commencement and review periodically thereafter. The Ministry of Justice concluded a public call for evidence on January 30, 2019 prior to beginning its first review. We will continue to monitor the progress of potential changes to the Ogden rate.

(b) Noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the 19.9 percent investment in Fortitude Holdings by an affiliate of The Carlyle Group L.P. (Carlyle), which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Carlyle is allocated 19.9 percent of Fortitude Holdings’ standalone financial results. Fortitude Holdings’ results are mostly eliminated in AIG’s consolidated income from continuing operations given that its results arise from intercompany transactions. Noncontrolling interests is calculated based on the standalone financial results of Fortitude Holdings. The most significant component of Fortitude Holdings’ standalone results concerns gains related to the change in fair value of embedded derivatives, which moved materially in the quarter due to lower rates and tightening credit spreads, and which are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses of Fortitude Holdings. In accordance with AIG's adjusted after-tax income definition, realized capital gains and losses are excluded from noncontrolling interests.

These increases were more than offset by: • higher net realized capital losses due to Life and Retirement guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, which reflected net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net realized capital gains in the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to changes in the movement in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment (NPA), which is not hedged as part of our economic hedging program (see Insurance Reserves – Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC – Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results), partially offset from gains in fixed income securities due to credit spreads tightening; and • a net loss reserve discount charge in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a loss reserve discount benefit in the first quarter of 2018. U.S. Tax Reform Overview On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduced the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry. Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income.  The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. There are substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of BEAT and GILTI and, while certain formal guidance was issued by the U.S. tax authority, there are still aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear and additional guidance is expected later in 2019. Such guidance may result in changes to the interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take, which may impact amounts recorded with respect to international provisions of the Tax Act, possibly materially. Consistent with accounting guidance, we treat BEAT as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes in a similar manner.  Repatriation Assumptions As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For 2019, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. Deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. Interim Tax Calculation Method We use the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing our interim tax provision. Certain items, including those deemed to be unusual, infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. In these    AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 75       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations    cases, the actual tax expense or benefit is reported in the same period as the related item. Certain tax effects are also not reflected in the estimated annual effective tax rate, primarily certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions and are recorded in the period in which the change occurs. While certain impacts of the Tax Act are included in our annual effective tax rate, we continue to refine our calculations as additional information becomes available, which may result in changes to the estimated annual effective tax rate.  Income Tax expense analysis For the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 18.8 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, and valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by tax charges associated with the effect of foreign operations, state and local income taxes, a net tax charge related to the accrual of IRS interest, excess tax charges related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement, non-deductible transfer pricing charges, and U.S. tax imposed on GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The effect of foreign operations is primarily related to income in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates higher than 21 percent, other foreign taxes, and foreign income subject to U.S. taxation. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 22.6 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 21 percent primarily due to tax charges related to income in our foreign operations taxed at statutory tax rates higher than 21 percent, tax on GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries, valuation allowance activity related to certain foreign subsidiaries and non-deductible transfer pricing charges, partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax exempt income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement.    Business Segment Operations  Our business operations consist of General Insurance, Life and Retirement, Other Operations, and a Legacy Portfolio.  General Insurance consists of two operating segments: North America and International. Life and Retirement consists of four operating segments: Group Retirement, Individual Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets. Other Operations consists of businesses and items not allocated to our other businesses, which are primarily AIG Parent and Blackboard. Our Legacy Portfolio consists of our Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, and Legacy Investments. Effective February 2018, Fortitude Re is included in our Legacy Portfolio. The following table summarizes Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) from our business segment operations.

AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 77       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     COMPETITION and challenges  Operating in a highly competitive industry,  General Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty  insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign  insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service. We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis — from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise. Our challenges include:  • long-tail Commercial Lines exposures that create added challenges to pricing and risk management; • over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;  • tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and • volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:  General Insurance – North America  Commercial Lines over recent years has experienced challenging market conditions, with widespread excess capacity increasing competition and suppressing rates across multiple classes of business. However, in more recent periods we are seeing growing market support for rate increases in certain U.S. liability segments (outside of workers’ compensation), with increasing traction in excess casualty, D&O and commercial auto, where rates are supported by a trend of higher loss cost inflation. On the shorter tailed lines, the market is supporting higher rates for accounts which suffered losses from major catastrophe events in 2017 and 2018. We continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and classes of business as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. Further, we continue to achieve growth in several of our Commercial Lines high margin businesses, although these market segments remain highly competitive. Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.  General Insurance – International  We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increases due to the growing number of international customers, while giving us the ability to respond quickly to local market conditions and build client relationships. The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, due to increased market capacity and ample availability of capital. Despite this, we continue to grow our most profitable segments and diversify our portfolio across all regions by expanding into new product lines (e.g., cyber), new client segments (e.g., middle market) and new distribution channels (e.g., digital and national brokers) while remaining a market leader in key developed and developing markets. We are maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability. Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines.   78 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance     General INSURANCE RESULTS     Three Months Ended March 31,                       Percentage         (in millions)       2019       2018       Change         Underwriting results:                                 Net premiums written   $   6,033   $   6,171       (2)   %     Decrease in unearned premiums       680       512       33         Net premiums earned       6,713       6,683       -         Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred(a)       4,233       4,488       (6)         Acquisition expenses:                                 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       1,159       1,066       9         Other acquisition expenses       303       385       (21)         Total acquisition expenses       1,462       1,451       1         General operating expenses       839       995       (16)         Underwriting income (loss)       179       (251)       NM         Net investment income       1,089       761       43         Adjusted pre-tax income (loss)   $   1,268   $   510       149   %       Loss ratio(a)       63.1       67.2       (4.1)         Acquisition ratio       21.8       21.7       0.1         General operating expense ratio        12.5       14.9       (2.4)         Expense ratio       34.3       36.6       (2.3)         Combined ratio(a)       97.4       103.8       (6.4)         Adjustments for accident year loss ratio, as adjusted                                 and accident year combined ratio, as adjusted:                                 Catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums       (2.7)       (5.7)       3.0         Prior year development, net of (additional) return premium on loss sensitive business       1.0       1.6       (0.6)         Adjustment for ceded premiums under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years and other       0.4       -       0.4         Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted       61.8       63.1       (1.3)         Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted       96.1       99.7       (3.6)        (a) Consistent with our definition of APTI, excludes net loss reserve discount and the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain.

This includes strengthening our talent base; ongoing investment in pricing and monitoring tools; continuous review of our risk appetite combined with enhanced focus on portfolio management and individual business strategy; and increased use of reinsurance. Adjusted pre-tax income increased in the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher net investment income reflecting higher income on alternative investments, lower catastrophe losses and the inclusion of the Validus acquisition. For a discussion of 2019 reinsurance programs see Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Results of Operation - Enterprise Risk Management in our 2018 Annual Report.      North America Adjusted Pre-Tax Income (Loss) Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income increased primarily due to: • higher net investment income reflecting higher income on alternative investments and the inclusion of the Validus acquisition; • lower catastrophe losses; and • lower current accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, driven primarily by underwriting actions and a change in business mix including the Validus and Glatfelter acquisitions.           North America Net Premiums Written Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison  Net premiums written increased primarily due to the inclusion of the Validus and Glatfelter acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by: • higher ceded premiums due to the changes in 2019 reinsurance programs; and • lower production primarily in Excess Casualty, Retail Property, and Construction due to underwriting actions taken to strengthen our portfolio and to maintain pricing discipline.

The decrease in the loss ratio primarily reflected: • lower catastrophe losses; and • lower accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, due to a change in business mix including the Validus and Glatfelter acquisitions. The decrease in the expense ratio reflected: • lower general operating expense ratio primarily driven by expense reduction initiatives; and • higher acquisition ratio primarily due to changes in portfolio mix and changes in the 2019 reinsurance programs.

Adjusted pre-tax income increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower General operating expenses, inclusion of the Validus acquisition and lower catastrophe losses. Net premiums written, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased primarily due to the Japan Merger Impact, higher ceded premiums, and lower Accident & Health business in Asia Pacific, partially offset by inclusion of the Validus acquisition.        International Adjusted Pre-Tax Loss Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax Income increased primarily due to: · lower general operating expenses;  · inclusion of the Validus acquisition; and · lower catastrophe losses.

International Combined Ratios Three Months Ended March 31,           2019 and 2018 Comparison  The decrease in the combined ratio reflected a decrease in both the expense ratio and the loss ratio. This decrease in the expense ratio reflected a lower general operating expense ratio driven by the Japan Merger Impact, lower employee-related expenses and other expense reduction initiatives.  This decrease in the loss ratio was primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses.                84 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement          Life and Retirement         PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION        Variable Annuities: Products include variable annuities that offer a combination of growth potential, death benefit features and income protection features.

Competition  is  primarily  based  on  product  pricing  and  design,  distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business. Our business remains competitive due to its  long-standing  market leading  positions,  innovative  products,  distribution  relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings. Our primary challenges include:  · a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields; · increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and peers with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space; · increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have affected industry growth; and · upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.  OUTLOOK—INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS  Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:  Individual Retirement  Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in  this product space. In  response  to  the  continued  low interest  rate environment, which  has  added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive  to  the  level of interest rates.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.   Group Retirement  Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the AIG Retirement Services brand. AIG Retirement Services is a leading retirement  plan provider in the  U.S. for  K-12  schools  and school  districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for  both plan  sponsors and individual participants.

AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 87       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Life Insurance  Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.  In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with lower long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.  As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the U.S. and the UK, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.   Institutional Markets  Institutional Markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. Demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. We expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.  Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities.

Interest rates declined in the first quarter of 2019 and remained low relative to historical levels. Excluding prior year deposits from FHLB funding agreements, premiums and deposits increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net flows increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher deposits driven by increased Fixed and Index Annuities sales, offset by lower sales for the Variable Annuities and Retail Mutual Funds.  Adjusted pre-tax income increased due to lower Variable Annuity DAC/SIA amortization and reserves from higher equity market performance, lower Fixed Annuity DAC amortization and reserves from policyholders reaching the end of the surrender charge period, higher base investment spread income primarily due to growth in Index Annuity assets from increased sales, and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected due to tightening spreads and lower rates. Partially offsetting these increases were lower returns on alternative investments, lower fee income and advisory fees, net of expenses, primarily driven by lower Variable Annuity AUM due to the equity market decline at the end of 2018, as well as prior year non-recurring payments on structured securities, and higher Index Annuity DAC amortization and reserves mostly driven by sales growth.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 89       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement          Individual Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income increased primarily due to: • an increase in net investment income, which included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and growth in income from base portfolio due to higher invested assets, and higher accretion income, partially offset by lower returns on alternative investments and prior-year non-recurring payments on structured securities; and • higher equity market performance, which contributed to decreases in Variable Annuity DAC amortization and reserves, and lower Fixed Annuity DAC amortization due to policyholders reaching the end of the surrender charge period, partially offset by higher Index Annuity DAC amortization driven by growth in sales and DAC model refinements. Partially offsetting these increases were: • lower Variable Annuity policy and advisory fee income net of expenses due to a decrease in Variable Annuity assets under management related to the equity market decline at the end of 2018.    Individual Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Individual Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.  Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, FHLB funding agreements and mutual funds under administration. Net flows for annuity products in Individual Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. Deposits from FHLB funding agreements were excluded from net flows of Individual Retirement, as net flows from these funding agreements are not considered part of the metric to measure Individual Retirement’s core recurring performance. The following table presents a reconciliation of Individual Retirement GAAP premiums to premiums and deposits:    Three Months Ended March 31,         (in millions)       2019       2018     Premiums   $   11   $   12     Deposits       4,175       4,347     Other       -       (1)     Premiums and deposits   $   4,186   $   4,358      90 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     The following table presents surrenders as a percentage of average reserves:    Three Months Ended March 31,   2019       2018         Surrenders as a percentage of average reserves                     Fixed Annuities   8.1   %   7.4   %     Variable and Index Annuities   6.0       6.4        The following table presents reserves for Fixed Annuities and Variable and Index Annuities by surrender charge category:        March 31, 2019       December 31, 2018                     Variable                   Variable                 Fixed       and Index           Fixed       and Index         (in millions)       Annuities       Annuities           Annuities       Annuities         No surrender charge   $   29,340   $   21,488       $   30,036   $   19,036         Greater than 0% - 2%       972       7,172           1,037       6,229         Greater than 2% - 4%       2,859       12,154           2,429       9,781         Greater than 4%       16,083       32,662           15,217       33,244         Non-surrenderable       1,643       486           1,608       474         Total reserves   $   50,897   $   73,962       $   50,327   $   68,764        Individual Retirement annuities are typically subject to a four- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. For Fixed Annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charge at March 31, 2019 has increased compared to December 31, 2018 due to improved net flows driven by higher Fixed Annuity sales, combined with fewer policyholders reaching the end of the surrender charge period in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in reserves with no surrender charge for Variable and Index Annuities at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 is due to normal aging of business. A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows:    Individual Retirement Premiums and Deposits (P&D) and Net Flows Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison  • Fixed Annuities premiums and deposits increased primarily due to higher broker dealer and bank distribution sales driven by favorable market conditions. Net flows increased primarily due to higher premiums and deposits, partially offset by increased surrenders. • Variable and Index Annuities premiums and deposits increased primarily due to higher Index annuity sales driven by growth in all key distribution channels partially offset by decline in Variable Annuity premiums and deposits driven by lower broker dealer and bank distribution sales. Index annuity net flows increased primarily due to higher sales partially offset by higher surrenders. Variable annuity net flows remained negative and deteriorated primarily due to a decline in sales offset by lower surrenders. • Funding Agreements premiums and deposits in the first quarter of 2018 reflected deposits from the FHLB funding agreements, which were excluded from reported net flows. • Retail Mutual Funds premiums and deposits and net flows remained negative and deteriorated reflecting lower deposits and higher withdrawals due to continued negative industry trends in U.S. equity actively managed funds and the impact of underperformance within our largest fund.

Net flows deteriorated in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders, partially offset by increased premiums and deposits.  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily from lower net investment income due to prior year receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities and lower alternative investment returns, lower fee income and higher general operating expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower variable annuity DAC amortization and reserves due to higher equity market performance.  Group Retirement base net investment spread in the first quarter of 2019 increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher accretion income.     92 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement        Group Retirement Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31,  (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison  Adjusted pre-tax income decreased primarily due to:  • lower net investment income, primarily from the prior year receipt of non-recurring payments on structured securities and lower returns on alternative investments, partially offset by higher income from base portfolio due to higher invested assets; • lower policy and advisory fees, net of expenses primarily driven by decrease in separate account and mutual fund assets; and  • higher general operating expenses primarily due to higher project costs and compensation, partially offset by reduced corporate expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases were: • lower variable annuity DAC amortization and reserves due to higher equity market performance.    Group Retirement GAAP Premiums, Premiums and Deposits, Surrenders and Net Flows For Group Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums in the first quarter of 2019, which primarily represent immediate annuities, decreased compared to the same period in the prior year. Overall, premiums is not a significant driver of the Group Retirement results. Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds under administration.

These increases were partially offset by lower universal life deposits and lower premiums in individual health and group benefits as a result of the strategic decision to refocus the business at the end of 2016.      96 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Institutional markets Results    Three Months Ended March 31,           Percentage         (in millions)       2019       2018       Change         Revenues:                                 Premiums   $   819   $   49       NM   %     Policy fees       41       41       -         Net investment income       211       187       13         Benefits and expenses:                                 Policyholder benefits and losses incurred       887       121       NM         Interest credited to policyholder account balances       89       72       24         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       1       1       -         Non deferrable insurance commissions       8       7       14         General operating expenses       15       14       7         Interest expense       3       3       -         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   68   $   59       15   %    Business and Financial Highlights Institutional Markets continued to opportunistically grow its assets under management, which drove the increase in net investment spread over recent years. Product distribution continues to be strong and the business is focused on maintaining pricing discipline to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns.      Institutional Markets Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)          2019 and 2018 Comparison  Increase in premiums and policyholder benefits were primarily due to pension risk transfer business written in the first quarter of 2019. Growth in reserves and assets under management drove the increase in net investment income with similar impact to policyholder benefits and interest credited. Adjusted pre-tax income increased primarily due to: • higher net investment income due to higher invested assets resulting from growth in Pension Risk Transfer and GIC over 2018. Partially offsetting these increases were: • lower alternative investment returns.      AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 97       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement     Institutional markets GAAP Premiums and Premiums and Deposits Premiums for Institutional Markets primarily represent amounts received on pension risk transfer or structured settlement annuities with life contingencies. Premiums increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the pension risk transfer business written in the first quarter of 2019. Premiums and deposits for Institutional Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes direct premiums as well as deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, including GICs. Deposits also include FHLB funding agreements.

Shift in premium and deposit mix is consistent with Institutional Markets’ strategy to opportunistically grow the portfolio.      98 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Other Operations      Other Operations          The following table presents Other Operations results:    Three Months Ended March 31,           Percentage         (in millions)       2019       2018       Change         Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) by activities:                                 Parent and Other:                                 Corporate general operating expenses   $   (183)   $   (153)       (20)   %     Interest expense       (303)       (238)       (27)         All other income (expense), net       99       49       102         Total Parent and Other       (387)       (342)       (13)         Consolidation, eliminations and other adjustments       (70)       11       NM         Adjusted pre-tax loss   $   (457)   $   (331)       (38)   %    2019 and 2018 Comparison Parent and Other adjusted pre-tax loss increased compared to the same period in prior year due to higher interest expense driven by debt issuances totaling $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher income from investments.           AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 99       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Legacy Portfolio    Legacy Portfolio          Legacy Portfolio represents exited or discontinued product lines, policy forms or distribution channels. Effective February 2018, our Bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, Fortitude Re, is included in our Legacy Portfolio. · Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines - Reserves consist of certain structured settlements, pension risk transfer annuities and single premium immediate annuities written prior to April 2012. Also includes exposures to whole life, long-term care and exited accident & health product lines. · Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines - Reserves consist of excess workers’ compensation, environmental exposures and exposures to other products within General Insurance that are no longer actively marketed. Also includes the remaining reserves in Eaglestone Reinsurance Company (Eaglestone).  · Legacy Investments – Includes investment classes that we have placed into run-off including holdings in direct investments as well as investments in global capital markets and global real estate.  BUSINESS STRATEGY   For Legacy insurance lines, securing the interests of our policyholders and insureds is paramount. We have considered and continue to evaluate the following strategies for these lines: • Third-party and affiliated reinsurance and retrocessions to improve capital efficiency • Commutations of assumed reinsurance and direct policy buy-backs • Enhance insured policyholder options and claims resolution strategies • Enhanced asset liability management and expense management For Legacy investments, our business strategy is to maximize liquidity to AIG Parent and minimize book value impairments while sourcing for our insurance companies attractive assets for their portfolios. SALE OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN FORTITUDE  Fortitude Re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in connection with a series of affiliated reinsurance transactions related to our Legacy Portfolio. Those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our Legacy Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity. As of March 31, 2019, the affiliated transactions included the cession of approximately $31 billion of reserves from our Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $4 billion of reserves from our Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2018, we formed Fortitude Holdings to act as a holding company for Fortitude Re. On November 13, 2018, we completed the sale of a 19.9 percent ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings to TCG, an affiliate of The Carlyle Group L.P. Fortitude Holdings owns 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of Fortitude Re and AIG has an 80.1 percent ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings. The affiliated reinsurance transactions executed in the first quarter of 2018 with Fortitude Re resulted in prepaid insurance assets on the ceding subsidiaries’ balance sheets of approximately $2.5 billion (after-tax). These assets have been eliminated in AIG’s consolidated financial statements since the counterparties were wholly owned. In the event of a sale of a controlling interest in Fortitude Holdings, our Legacy Portfolio may recognize a loss for the portion of the unamortized balance of these assets and related deferred acquisition costs of $0.5 billion (after-tax) that are not recoverable, if any, in the period in which our interest in Fortitude Holdings becomes non-controlling. This loss would be incremental to any gain or loss recognized on the sale of our controlling interest in Fortitude Holdings.         100 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | Legacy Portfolio    LEGACY PORTFOLIO RESULTS     Three Months Ended March 31,           Percentage         (in millions)       2019       2018       Change         Revenues:                                 Premiums   $   118   $   141       (16)   %     Policy fees       30       30       -         Net investment income       575       565       2         Other income (loss)       (17)       100       NM         Total adjusted revenues       706       836       (16)         Benefits and expenses:                                 Policyholder benefits and losses and loss adjustment                                 expenses incurred       432       506       (15)         Interest credited to policyholder account balances       54       59       (8)         Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs       18       18       -         General operating and other expenses       85       100       (15)         Interest expense       5       8       (38)         Total benefits and expenses       594       691       (14)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   112   $   145       (23)   %     Adjusted pre-tax income by type:                                 General Insurance Run-Off Lines   $   15   $   62       (76)   %     Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines       87       28       211         Legacy Investments       10       55       (82)         Adjusted pre-tax income   $   112   $   145       (23)   %     Selected Balance Sheet Data                                 Legacy Investments, net of related debt   $   2,548   $   2,779       (8)   %     Legacy General Insurance run-off reserves       5,432       5,926       (8)         Legacy Life and Retirement run-off reserves       37,262       37,793       (1)        Business and Financial Highlights Legacy insurance lines, including those ceded to Fortitude Re, continue to run-off as anticipated for Legacy General Insurance and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines. Legacy investments have been reduced significantly over the last several years declining from $6.7 billion at December 31, 2016 to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2019. The remaining Legacy investments primarily include structured credit junior notes for which we have elected the fair value option and real estate investments.    Legacy Portfolio Adjusted Pre-Tax Income Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions)        2019 and 2018 Comparison Adjusted pre-tax income decreased due to: • Lower Legacy General Insurance earnings compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to lower net investment income and lower premiums driven by the continued run-off of the Legacy General Insurance portfolio; and • Lower Legacy Investment earnings compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to the continued decrease in net assets of the Legacy Investments Portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by higher Legacy Life and Retirement earnings compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a refinement in reserves related to payout annuities in the first quarter of 2018, which did not impact the first quarter of 2019.       AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 101       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments      Investments  Overview Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective operating segments and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.    Investment Highlights in the First Quarter of 2019     • A drop in interest rates and narrowing credit spreads resulted in a net unrealized gain in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $9.6 billion as of March 31, 2019 from approximately $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2018. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • Higher investment returns in our hedge fund portfolio and equity securities due to robust equity market returns in the first quarter of 2019 and an increase in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected, compared to the same period in the prior year where returns were lower as a result of an increase in rates and widening spreads that occurred, as well as negative performance of our fair value option equity securities portfolio. • During the first quarter of 2019, we sold our remaining investment in People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited and PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.     Investment Strategies  Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in General Insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by General Insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  • Our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.  • AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. Attribution of Net Investment Income to Operating Segments Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses. For General Insurance — North America and International and Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the General Insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment   102 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    For Life and Retirement — Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life and Retirement companies. All invested assets of the Life and Retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment. Asset Liability Measurement For the General Insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The General Insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the General Insurance companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, a portion of the surplus of General Insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments which seeks to balance liquidity, volatility and growth. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations, with an average duration of 3.8 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity securities held in the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.4 years. The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life and Retirement companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.  The Life and Retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies, we have reduced the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.  Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.2 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 103       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    Fixed maturity securities held in the Life and Retirement companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 18.2 years. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade.  The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.

Approximately 16 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At March 31, 2019, approximately 25 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 7 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 29 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.   104 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Investments    Composite AIG Credit Ratings With respect to our fixed maturity securities, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity securities), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.

Based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized. The following tables present other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in earnings on fixed maturity securities, equity securities, private equity funds and hedge funds.

In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security.

(e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary. Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the first quarter of 2019, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity securities increased by $6.0 billion due primarily to a decrease in rates and a narrowing of credit spreads.  The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the first quarter of 2018, net unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities decreased by $5.0 billion due primarily to an increase in rates and a widening of credit spreads.

Net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2018 were primarily related to other-than-temporary impairment charges and derivative losses, which were higher than the gains on sales of securities and foreign exchange gains. Variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected losses in the first quarter of 2019 compared to gains in the same period in the prior year primarily due to changes in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the valuation of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) embedded derivative, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Life and Retirement Companies Key Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs in the 2018 Annual Report.

Consistent with our definition of APTI, the amount excludes the portion of (favorable)/unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under the NICO reinsurance agreements of $1 million and $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain of $28 million and $(23) million over those same periods.   114 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     Net Loss Development In the first quarter of 2019, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of $74 million. For North America, the favorable development was primarily driven by amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, favorable development in U.S. Property and Special Risks driven by favorable catastrophe activity, offset by adverse development in Excess Casualty. For International, the favorable development was driven by Europe and Japan Personal Insurance and Europe Property and Special Risks offset by adverse development in Europe Casualty and Financial Lines. In the first quarter of 2018, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of $110 million. For North America, the favorable development was primarily driven by amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO.

Significant Reinsurance Agreements In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement. For a description of AIG’s catastrophe reinsurance protection for 2019, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks – Natural Catastrophe Risk in our 2018 Annual Report. The table below shows the calculation of the deferred gain on the adverse development reinsurance agreement as of March 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2018, showing the effect of discounting of loss reserves and amortization of the deferred gain.

The agreement is expected to result in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. In addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets. For a summary of significant reinsurers see Item 7.

LIFE AND ANNUITY reserves and dac The following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs. Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. The liabilities for GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors. In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.  For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Life and Retirement Companies Key Risks – Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs in our 2018 Annual Report. Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following: • The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero; • The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and • The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include: • Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative; • Realized volatility versus implied volatility;  • Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and • Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 117       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:                                March 31,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2019       2018     Reconciliation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target:                                         Embedded derivative liability                       $   2,023   $   1,943     Exclude non-performance risk adjustment                           (2,439)       (2,615)     Embedded derivative liability, excluding NPA                           4,462       4,558     Adjustments for risk margins and differences in valuation                           (2,485)       (2,377)     Economic hedge target liability                       $   1,977   $   2,181    Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss) The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits. The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:    Three Months Ended March 31,             (in millions)       2019       2018     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA   $   215   $   551     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio:                     Fixed maturity securities       96       (77)     Interest rate derivative contracts       293       (406)     Equity derivative contracts       (593)       74     Change in fair value of variable annuity hedging portfolio       (204)       (409)     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives excluding NPA, net of hedging portfolio        11       142     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to NPA spread       (163)       72     Change in fair value of embedded derivatives due to change in NPA volume       (13)       (144)     Total change due to NPA       (176)       (72)     Net impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   (165)   $   70                           By Consolidated Income Statement line                     Net investment income   $   96   $   (77)     Net realized capital gains (losses)       (261)       147     Net impact on pre-tax income (loss)   $   (165)   $   70    The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges in the first quarter of 2019 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by losses from credit spread tightening and lower equity volatility on the economic hedge target and the impact of tighter credit spreads on the NPA spread. The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in the first quarter of 2018 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by gains from the impact of widening credit spreads on the NPA spread, higher interest rates and equity market volatility, partially offset by the impact on NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, which was driven by higher interest rates.   118 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     The change in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, excluding NPA and update of actuarial assumptions, in the first quarter of 2019 reflected gains from higher equity markets, offset by losses from decreases in interest rates, tightening of credit spreads, and lower equity volatility. The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding NPA, in the first quarter of 2018 reflected gains from equity market volatility and reductions in risk margins due to higher interest rates, partially offset by losses from the related hedging portfolio.  Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis, due to the NPA and other risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below. Change in Economic Hedge Target The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to higher equity markets, offset by lower interest rates and tightening of credit spreads.  Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under U.S. GAAP, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio: • Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the first quarter of 2019 reflected gains due to decreases in interest rates, and tightening of credit spreads. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the first quarter of 2018 reflected losses due to increases in interest rates and widening of credit spreads, The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). • Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in gains driven by lower interest rates in the first quarter of 2019 compared to losses in the first quarter of 2018 which was driven by higher interest rates.  • The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, reflected losses in the first quarter of 2019 compared to gains in the same period in the prior year, which varied based on the relative change in equity market returns in the respective periods. DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in DAC, including VOBA, within the Life and Retirement companies, excluding DAC of the Legacy Portfolio:     Three Months Ended March 31,                     (in millions)       2019       2018     Balance, beginning of year   $   9,133   $   7,637     Acquisition costs deferred       336       249     Amortization expense:                     Related to realized capital gains and losses       93       (27)     All other operating amortization       (200)       (246)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange       7       12     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments       (781)       564     Balance, end of period*   $   8,588   $   8,189    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $9.6 billion and $8.9 billion at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 119       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Insurance Reserves     DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income (OCI) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow Loss Adjustments) with an offset to OCI to be recorded. Shadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.  Market interest rates decreased in the first quarter of 2019, which resulted in a $5.2 billion increase in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the Life and Retirement companies at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. At March 31, 2019, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected decreases in DAC and unearned revenues and an increase in future policy benefit liabilities compared to December 31, 2018, while the shadow Loss Adjustments reflected an increase in future policy benefit liabilities.

AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 121       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources       Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We endeavor to manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.  See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management in the 2018 Annual Report for additional information.  Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing preferred stock, paying dividends to our shareholders and AIG Common Stock and/or warrant repurchases.    122 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ACTIVITY FOR the first quarter of 2019  Sources  AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries* During the first quarter of 2019, AIG Parent received $1.0 billion in dividends from subsidiaries. Of this amount, $522 million consisted of dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our General Insurance companies and $504 million consisted of dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash from our Life and Retirement companies. AIG Parent also received a net amount of $201 million in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in the first quarter of 2019. The tax sharing payments may be subject to further adjustment in future periods. Preferred Stock Issuance In March 2019, we issued 20,000 shares of Series A 5.85% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, with a par value of $5.00 per share and a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $485 million. Debt Issuance In March 2019, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Notes Due 2029.  Uses   Debt Reduction We made repurchases of and repayments on debt instruments of approximately $597 million during the first quarter of 2019. AIG Parent made interest payments on our debt instruments totaling $225 million during the first quarter of 2019. Dividend We paid a cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock during the first quarter of 2019 totaling $278 million.  AIG Parent Funding to Subsidiaries In February 2019, AIG Parent made a capital contribution of $300 million to our General Insurance companies.    * In April 2019, we received $75 million in additional dividends in the form of cash from our General Insurance companies. These dividends had been declared during the first quarter of 2019.

The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $315 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $357 million in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding interest payments, AIG had operating cash outflows of $661 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to operating cash outflows of $581 million in the first quarter of 2018.  Investing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2019 was $2.0 billion compared to investing cash outflows of $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2018.    124 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Financing Cash Flow Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2019 reflected: • approximately $278 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock; • approximately $860 million in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt; and • approximately $485 million inflow from the issuance of preferred stock. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of 2018 reflected: • approximately $289 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock; • approximately $298 million to repurchase approximately 5 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $1.7 billion in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries AIG Parent As of March 31, 2019, AIG Parent had approximately $9.7 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or AIG Common Stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management. In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital. The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   March 31, 2019   December 31, 2018     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   1,619   $   626     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       3,547       3,168     Total AIG Parent liquidity       5,166       3,794     Available capacity under committed, syndicated credit facility(c)       4,500       4,500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   9,666   $   8,294    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $884 million and $22 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. (c) For additional information relating to this committed, syndicated credit facility see Credit Facilities below.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 125       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Insurance Companies We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements. Our General Insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect a subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. General Insurance companies had no outstanding borrowings from FHLBs at March 31, 2019 and aggregate outstanding borrowings of approximately $115 million at December 31, 2018. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from FHLBs at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In addition, $3.4 billion was due to FHLBs in the respective districts of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Institutional Markets operating segments, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits.  Certain of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments or partially used for short-term liquidity purposes. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $1.4 billion and $884 million of securities subject to these agreements at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and $1.4 billion and $904 million of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In February 2018, AIG Parent entered into a CMA with Fortitude Re. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain available statutory capital and surplus in each of Fortitude Re’s long term business fund and general business account at or above a stress threshold percentage of its projected enhanced capital requirement in respect of the applicable fund, as defined under Bermuda law. As of March 31, 2019, the stress threshold percentage under this CMA was 125 percent. AIG Parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. Letters of credit issued in support of the General Insurance companies totaled approximately $3.5 billion at March 31, 2019. Letters of credit issued in support of the Life and Retirement companies totaled approximately $859 million at March 31, 2019. Letters of credit issued in support of Fortitude Re totaled $550 million at March 31, 2019.   126 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     In the first quarter of 2019, our General Insurance companies collectively paid a total of approximately $522 million in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. In the first quarter of 2019, our Life and Retirement companies collectively paid a total of approximately $504 million in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash to AIG Parent.  Tax Matters If the settlement agreements in principle are concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. Although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.7 billion, including obligations of AIG Parent and subsidiaries. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. There remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payments, which are not likely to be made before sometime in early 2020. For additional information regarding this matter see Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Facilities We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2022. As of March 31, 2019, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Facility. Our ability to utilize the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to utilize the Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

(b) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (c) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.7 billion. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss Reserves Loss reserves relate to our General Insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our General Insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life and Retirement companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life and Retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life and Retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.    128 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Borrowings Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt or preferred stock issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

For further information on indemnification obligations see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities. (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining annual pension contribution for 2019 is expected to be approximately $47 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 129       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities  We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.  For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements. Debt The following table provides the rollforward of AIG’s total debt outstanding:            Balance at               Maturities       Effect of                   Balance at     Three Months Ended March 31, 2019       December 31,               and       Foreign       Other       March 31,     (in millions)       2018       Issuances   Repayments       Exchange       Changes           2019     Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                                         AIG general borrowings:                                                         Notes and bonds payable   $   20,853   $   596   $   -   $   (30)   $   8       $   21,427     Junior subordinated debt       1,548       -       -       (3)       -           1,545     AIG Japan Holdings Kabushiki Kaisha       331       -       -       7       -           338     Validus notes and bonds payable       359       -       -       -       (2)           357     AIGLH notes and bonds payable       282       -       -       -       -           282     AIGLH junior subordinated debt       361       -       -       -       -           361     Total AIG general borrowings       23,734       596       -       (26)       6           24,310     AIG borrowings supported by assets:(a)                                                         Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable       21       -       -       -       -           21     GIAs, at fair value       2,164       37       (61)       -       72   (b)       2,212     Notes and bonds payable, at fair value       49       -       (2)       -       4   (b)       51     Total AIG borrowings supported by assets       2,234       37       (63)       -       76           2,284     Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG       25,968       633       (63)       (26)       82           26,594     Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                                         Other subsidiaries' notes, bonds, loans and                                                         mortgages payable(c)       168       -       (116)       -       -           52     Debt of consolidated investments(d)       8,404       816       (418)       6       322   (e)        9,130     Total debt not guaranteed by AIG       8,572       816       (534)       6       322           9,182     Total debt   $   34,540   $   1,449   $   (597)   $   (20)   $   404       $   35,776    (a) AIG Parent guarantees all such debt, except for Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable, which are direct obligations of AIG Parent. Collateral posted to third parties was $1.5 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties. (b) Primarily represents adjustments to the fair value of debt. (c) Includes primarily borrowings with Federal Home Loan Banks by our U.S. insurance companies. These borrowings are short term in nature and related activity is presented net of issuances and maturities and repayments.

(d) AIG guarantees all obligations of AIG Financial Products Corp. These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. In the event of a downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative and other transactions, or certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate such transactions early.   132 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources     The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

Business — Regulation and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation in our 2018 Annual Report, and Regulatory Environment below in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock  On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2019. On May 6, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on June 28, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2019. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, as discussed further in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to its previous repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of approximately $1.5 billion. As of May 6, 2019, $2.0 billion remained under the authorization. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, as discussed further in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not repurchase any shares of AIG Common Stock during the three months ended March 31, 2019.   Restrictions on dividends from subsidiaries Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities.  For a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2018 Annual Report.     AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    ITEM 2 | Enterprise Risk Management    Enterprise Risk Management  Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management by embedding risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by our businesses and AIG overall. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2018 Annual Report. As of March 31, 2019, there have been no material changes in our economic exposure to market risk from December 31, 2018, a description of which may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2018, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K on how difficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of our operations.    Regulatory Environment   Overview Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. We expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2018 Annual Report.     134 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Glossary  Accident year  The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs and certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting.  Additional premium represents a premium on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium imposed at the beginning of the policy. An additional premium may be assessed if the insured’s risk is found to have increased significantly. Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes). Assets under administration include assets under management and Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement mutual fund assets that we sell or administer.  Assets under management include assets in the general and separate accounts of our subsidiaries that support liabilities and surplus related to our life and annuity insurance products and the notional value of stable value wrap contracts. Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected. Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book value per common share excluding AOCI is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by total common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels. CVA Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in AIGFP's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only, without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk in the fair value measurement of all derivative net liability positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business.   AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q 135       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments  An adjustment to DAC and Reserves for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC and Unearned Revenue amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity securities available for sale and also, prior to 2018, equity securities at fair value had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. An adjustment to benefit reserves for investment-oriented products is also recognized to reflect the application of the benefit ratio to the accumulated assessments that would have been recorded if fixed maturity securities available for sale and also, prior to 2018, equity securities at fair value had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (collectively referred to as “shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments”). For long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. General operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses. GIC/GIA Guaranteed Investment Contract/Guaranteed Investment Agreement A contract whereby the seller provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time. IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.  Loss Ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.  Loss reserve development  The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to prior years as a result of the re-estimation of loss reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. Natural catastrophe and man-made losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period, while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period.   136 AIG | First Quarter 2019 Form 10-Q      TABLE OF CONTENTS    Glossary     Noncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. Policy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses. Pool  A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage.  Premiums and deposits – Life and Retirement include direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and group benefit policies, and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, FHLB funding agreements and mutual funds. Prior year development See Loss reserve development. RBC Risk-Based Capital A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. Reinstatement premiums Additional premiums payable to reinsurers or receivable from insurers to restore coverage limits that have been reduced or exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. Retroactive Reinsurance See Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance. Return on equity – Adjusted after-tax income excluding AOCI and DTA (Adjusted Return on equity) is a non-GAAP measure and is used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. Adjusted Return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG by average Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity.  Return premium represents amounts given back to the insured in the case of a cancellation, an adjustment to the rate or an overpayment of an advance premium. Salvage The amount that can be recovered by an insurer for the sale of damaged goods for which a policyholder has been indemnified (and to which title was transferred). SIA Sales Inducement Asset Represents enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on certain annuity and investment contract products that meet the criteria to be deferred and amortized over the life of the contract. Solvency II  Legislation in the European Union which reforms the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) was adopted on November 25, 2009 and became effective on January 1, 2016. Subrogation  The amount of recovery for claims we have paid our policyholders, generally from a negligent third party or such party’s insurer.  Surrender charge A charge levied against an investor for the early withdrawal of funds from a life insurance or annuity contract, or for the cancellation of the agreement.  Surrender rate represents annualized surrenders and withdrawals as a percentage of average reserves and Group Retirement mutual fund assets under administration. Unearned premium reserve Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect unearned premiums, which are usually refundable to policyholders if an insurance or reinsurance contract is canceled prior to expiration of the contract term. VOBA Value of Business Acquired Present value of projected future gross profits from in-force policies of acquired businesses.

ITEM 4 | Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation, which excluded the impact of the acquisitions of Validus Holdings and Glatfelter Insurance Group (collectively, the Acquired Businesses), was carried out by AIG management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of March 31, 2019. Based on this evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We continue to integrate the internal controls of the Acquired Businesses. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) that have occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2 | Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to its previous repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $1.5 billion. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, we did not repurchase any shares of AIG Common Stock or any warrants to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock under this authorization. As of March 31, 2019, approximately $2.0 billion remained under the authorization. We did not repurchase any shares of AIG Common Stock from April 1, 2019 to May 6, 2019. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. The repurchase of AIG Common Stock is also subject to the terms of AIG’s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, pursuant to which AIG may not (other than in limited circumstances) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire AIG Common Stock unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or provided for.
