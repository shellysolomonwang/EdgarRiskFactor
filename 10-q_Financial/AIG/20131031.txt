MD&A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (2012 Annual Report).     AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     73                Table of Contents    The MD&A is organized as follows:    INDEX TO ITEM 2                       Page          USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES   75          EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    76          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    87       Segment Results   90    AIG Property Casualty Operations   95    Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense   112    AIG Life and Retirement Operations   118    Other Operations   131    Discontinued Operations   138       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    139       Overview   139    Analysis of Sources and Uses of Cash   141    Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries   142    Credit Facilities   148    Contingent Liquidity Facilities   148    Contractual Obligations   149    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments   151    Debt   152    Credit Ratings   154    Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock   155       INVESTMENTS    156       Overview   156    Investment Highlights   156    Investment Strategies   156    Credit Ratings   157    Investment by Segment   159    Available-for-Sale Investments   161    Impairments   167       ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT    172       Overview   172    Credit Risk Management   172    Market Risk Management   177    Liquidity Risk Management   179       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    180          REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT    184          GLOSSARY    186          ACRONYMS    190            74                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES       Use of Non-GAAP Measures  Throughout this MD&A, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful, representative and most transparent. Some of the measurements we use are "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for "accounting principles generally accepted in the United States." The non-GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.    Book Value Per Common Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (AOCI) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A.  We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG and our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A.   •  AIG — After-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses and properties, income from divested businesses, legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments, legal reserves (settlements) related to "legacy crisis matters," deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges, changes in fair values of AIG Life and Retirement fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital (gains) losses, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses, and bargain purchase gain. "Legacy crisis matters" include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.  •  AIG Property Casualty    •  Pre-tax operating income (loss): includes both underwriting income (loss) and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital (gains) losses, other (income) expense, legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above and bargain purchase gain. Underwriting income (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses.   •  Ratios: AIG Property Casualty, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.     •  Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG Property Casualty in excess of $10 million each.        75      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES   •  AIG Life and Retirement    •   Pre-tax operating income (loss): is derived by excluding the following items from pre-tax income (loss): legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above, changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), net realized capital (gains) losses, and changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital (gains) losses.   •  Premiums and deposits: includes amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) and mutual funds.    •  Other Operations — Pre-tax operating income (loss): pre-tax income (loss) excluding certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters described above, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses and properties, and income from divested businesses.  Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.   Executive Overview   This overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2012 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.  We report our results of operations as follows:  •   AIG Property Casualty — AIG Property Casualty offers property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses and individuals worldwide. Commercial insurance products for large and small businesses are primarily distributed through insurance brokers. Major lines of business include casualty, property, financial and specialty (including aerospace, environmental, surety, marine, trade credit and political risk insurance). Consumer insurance products are distributed to individual consumers or groups of consumers through insurance brokers, agents, and on a direct-to-consumer basis. Consumer insurance products include accident & health (A&H) and personal insurance. In addition, Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji) in Japan offers life insurance products through Fuji Life Insurance Company (Fuji Life), which are included in A&H.  •  AIG Life and Retirement — AIG Life and Retirement offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life, universal life, A&H, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. AIG Life and Retirement offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct-to-consumer platforms. During the first quarter of 2013, AIG Life and Retirement completed its previously announced reporting structure changes and now presents its results in the following two operating segments: Retail and Institutional. See Segment Results — AIG Life and Retirement for additional information.  •   Other Operations — AIG's Other Operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty operations (conducted through United Guaranty Corporation (UGC)), Global Capital Markets (GCM) operations (consisting of the operations of AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP)), Direct Investment book (DIB), including the Matched Investment Program (MIP) and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP, Retained Interests and Corporate & Other operations (after certain allocations to AIG's business segments).     76                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW       Executive Summary      Financial Performance       AIG Property Casualty pre-tax operating income improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. Underwriting performance improved in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, as evidenced by the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, which declined to 98.0 and 97.2, respectively, compared to 100.1 and 99.6 in the same periods in the prior year. The improvement in pre-tax operating income also reflected lower catastrophe losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Net investment income declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to decreases in returns on alternative investments and mutual funds. However, net investment income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to an increase in alternative investment income and income associated with PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) shares.    AIG Life and Retirement reported growth in assets under management since December 31, 2012 from strong sales of variable annuities, retail mutual funds and stable value wraps, as well as strong equity market performance. Pre-tax operating income improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 from effective spread management, growth in fee income, and adjustments to update certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in our interest-sensitive product lines.    Mortgage Guaranty pre-tax operating income improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to a decline in delinquency rates and improving cure rates. New insurance written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to the market acceptance of UGC's risk-based pricing model by an increasing number of lenders as well as the addition and expansion of distribution channels.    Our investment portfolio performance, excluding gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investments in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) and AIA Group Limited (AIA), declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in alternative investment income as a result of unfavorable equity market performance and the reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in a low interest rate environment. The investment portfolio performance improved in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to an increase in alternative investment income largely as a result of favorable equity market performance in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, partially offset by the effect of our reinvestment in a low interest rate environment.    Net realized capital gains declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to relatively lower gains from sales of certain assets in unrealized gain positions as part of our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards. Net realized capital gains improved in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to relatively higher gains from sales of certain assets in unrealized gain positions as part of our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and continued low levels of other-than-temporary impairments.      Liquidity and Capital Resources 2013 Highlights        We reduced our debt in the first nine months of 2013 as a result of maturities, repayments and repurchases of $7.6 billion. Partially offsetting this decrease was the issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2020.    We maintained financial flexibility in the first nine months of 2013 through $1.5 billion in cash dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and $3.1 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.     Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock on August 1, 2013, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, we repurchased approximately four million shares of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock) under this authorization at a total cost of approximately $192 million.     We paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.10 per share on September 26, 2013.    Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on October 31, 2013 of $0.10 per share, payable on December 19, 2013 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2013.     77      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Our Performance — Selected Indicators                                                            Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions, except per share data and ratios)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Results of operations data:                                     Total revenues        $   14,826    $ 16,722        $   48,029    $ 50,440      Income from continuing operations           2,172      1,824           7,035      7,369      Net income attributable to AIG           2,170      1,856           7,107      7,396      Net income per common share attributable to AIG (diluted)           1.46      1.13           4.80      4.21      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG           1,421      1,621           5,058      6,345          Key metrics:                                     AIG Property Casualty combined ratio           101.6      105.0           100.5      103.2      AIG Property Casualty accident year combined ratio, as adjusted           98.0      100.1           97.2      99.6      AIG Life and Retirement premiums and deposits        $   8,422    $ 4,785        $   20,767    $ 15,779      AIG Life and Retirement assets under management           304,399      275,479           304,399      275,479      Mortgage Guaranty new insurance written           14,437      10,741           39,074      25,880                                                  (in millions, except per share data)      September 30, 2013      December 31, 2012            Balance sheet data:                      Total assets        $   540,744    $ 548,633      Long-term debt           42,231      48,500      Total AIG shareholders' equity           98,793      98,002      Book value per common share           67.10      66.38      Book value per common share, excluding AOCI           62.68      57.87           The following table presents a reconciliation of Book value per common share to Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a non-GAAP measure.

Net investment income for our insurance operations decreased by approximately $173 million and increased by approximately $234 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three-month period is due to lower returns on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields. The increase for the nine-month period is due to higher alternative investment income, driven primarily by favorable equity market performance, which was partially offset by gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investment in ML II. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.  Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio declined to approximately $13 billion as of September 30, 2013 from approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2012 due to rising interest rates over the period and the realization of approximately $2.1 billion in gains from sales of securities.  Other-than-temporary impairments were significantly lower for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 relative to the prior year period partly driven by strong performance in our structured products portfolios due to favorable developments in the housing sector.  The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was largely unchanged for this quarter.     80      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Presentation Changes     Prior period revenues and expenses were conformed to the current period presentation. These changes did not affect Income from continuing operations before income tax expense or Net income attributable to AIG. Also, the presentation of the operating segments within the AIG Life and Retirement segment was revised in the first quarter of 2013 to reflect two new operating segments: Retail and Institutional. For further discussion, see Notes 1 and 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.       Strategic Outlook      Industry Trends     Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2013, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global markets due to the negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling, the U.S. Government shutdown and slow growth in the U.S. economy.  Although there has been a recent rise in interest rates in the U.S. fixed income market, interest rates remain low relative to historical levels, which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines.       AIG Priorities for 2013 and Beyond   AIG remains focused on the following priorities for 2013 and beyond:  •Strengthen and improve the operating performance of our core businesses;   •Consummate the sale or monetization of our interest in ILFC;  •Enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality;   •Manage our capital and interest expense more efficiently by improving our capital structure and redeploying excess capital in areas that promote profitable growth;  •Work with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) in its capacity as our principal regulator; and   •Reduce operating expenses by leveraging our scale and driving increased standardization through investments in infrastructure.        Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2013 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2012 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.     81      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OUTLOOK          Executive Overview    •   Business Mix Shift — Continue shifting toward higher value business to increase profitability and expand in attractive growth economies, specifically in Asia Pacific, Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.   •  Underwriting Excellence — Enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate to the risk assumed.  •  Claims Best Practices — Implement improved claims practices and advanced technology to lower the loss ratio.  •   Operating Expense Discipline — Apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of our global footprint.  •  Capital Efficiency — Continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency.  •   Investment Strategy — Continue to execute our investment strategy, which includes increased asset diversification and yield-enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity, risk and return objectives.       Market Conditions and Industry Trends     We expect the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets. Due to these conditions, coupled with overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, we have sought to modify terms and conditions, exit unprofitable business and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability.  We have observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. Commencing in the second quarter of 2011, we have benefitted from favorable pricing trends, particularly in our U.S. commercial business. The property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in some markets. We also expect that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions.      Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities       Business Mix Shift     As part of our strategy to expand our consumer operations in growth economies, on May 29, 2013, we entered into a joint venture agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company Limited (PICC Life), a subsidiary of The People's Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited (PICC Group), to form an agency distribution company in China. Products under consideration to be distributed by the joint venture company include jointly developed life and retirement insurance products, existing PICC Life products, PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) insurance products, AIG Property Casualty products, as well as other products aimed at meeting the needs of this developing market. We will own 24.9 percent of the joint venture company with PICC Life holding the remaining 75.1 percent. Our participation in the joint venture will be managed by AIG Property Casualty. The joint venture is planned to commence operations by the first quarter of 2014 subject to regulatory approval.  On June 6, 2013, we also exercised rights to purchase shares in connection with the rights offering of PICC P&C, a subsidiary of the PICC Group, for a purchase price of approximately $93 million. Immediately prior to and after the rights offering, we owned 9.9 percent of the outstanding shares in PICC P&C.     82      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW     Capital Efficiency     We continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for our operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, we remain focused on enhancing our global reinsurance strategy to improve capital efficiency.  We continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency. In the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we completed 29 legal entity and branch restructuring transactions. We continue to implement restructuring plans in various jurisdictions. Our overall legal entity restructuring is expected to be mostly completed by the end of 2014, subject to regulatory approvals in those jurisdictions.  On July 16, 2013, we announced the planned merger of AIU Insurance Company Ltd. and Fuji, scheduled to take place in the second half of 2015 or later, subject to regulatory approvals. The merger is consistent with our growth strategy for the Japan market, and is intended to combine the expertise and experience of these companies to meet our customers' and partners' needs and provide products and services that will target higher levels of customer satisfaction in a cost-effective manner.  We continued our strategy to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. On July 9, 2013, we entered into a five-year catastrophe bond transaction, which will provide $125 million of indemnity protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. The transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through June 2018. In addition, effective May 31, 2013, we modified certain internal reinsurance arrangements from our Japan entities to simplify operations and facilitate efficient capital allocation.  On September 1, 2013, we transferred the ownership of AIG Europe Holdings Limited from AIG Overseas Association and AIG Overseas Limited to AIG Property Casualty International LLC. This transaction is expected to enhance capital efficiency and increase dividend capacity in the future.      AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OUTLOOK          Executive Overview    •  Grow Assets Under Management — Leverage our unified distribution organization, innovative product design and financial discipline to increase sales of profitable products across all distribution channels.  •  Deliver Innovative Products — Develop superior, differentiated product solutions that meet consumer needs for financial and retirement security.  •  Pursue Operational Efficiencies — Continue to streamline our life insurance and annuity platforms, operations and administrative systems.  •  Increase Return on Equity — Deliver solid earnings and increase capital efficiency within our life insurance entities. •  Investment Strategy — Maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities and match the duration characteristics of liabilities with assets of comparable duration and pursue yield-enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity, risk and return objectives.       Market Conditions and Industry Trends       Market Conditions     Strong equity market performance and low volatility, coupled with positive demographic trends, have provided a favorable environment for sales of individual variable annuities, and contributed to growth in separate account assets under management in both our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines, which has resulted in higher fee income. Equity market volatility and changes in interest rates affect the level of reserves for variable     83      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  annuity guaranteed benefit features and may affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC assets for such products. Innovative product design and our comprehensive dynamic hedging program are critical tools for managing volatility for products where we have equity market exposure.  The low interest rate environment relative to historical levels continues to affect our business as well as the life and annuity industry overall. Continued low interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products such as fixed annuities, and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. Products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate-adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields fall to a level that results in expected future losses. In addition, low interest rates can affect future investment margins and may also affect the recoverability and amortization rate of DAC assets in our variable annuity, fixed annuity and universal life businesses.  We will continue to address the impact of low interest rates. We actively manage renewal crediting rates and have a disciplined approach to pricing new sales of interest rate sensitive products, including reduced minimum rate guarantees. Also, as market conditions change, we manage our asset and liability interest rate exposures and strategic asset allocation to emphasize lower or higher durations in the portfolio. Overall, the recent modest increase in interest rates has improved our outlook for sales and profitability.  Rapid and significant increases from current market interest rates, however, could result in elevated surrender activity in interest sensitive products, primarily fixed annuities with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates. The extent of elevated surrender activity, if any, will depend on the level of minimum guarantees in existing contracts relative to the pace and extent of market interest rate increases.    Industry Trends     Consumer demand for guaranteed income features and changes in the competitive landscape for individual variable annuities have provided a positive environment for sales of our Retirement Income Solutions products. Assuming no significant changes in market conditions, strong sales of these products are expected to continue as consumers seek to address their need for financial and retirement security.  Industry fixed annuity sales, which have been challenged by the sustained, historically low interest rate environment, have benefited recently from the modest increase in interest rates. Sales and net flows in our Fixed Annuities product line are improving as increasing market interest rates and steepening of the yield curve make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits.  The life insurance marketplace continues to be highly competitive. We are continuing to execute our strategy of leveraging our scale, utilizing our expertise in pricing and risk selection, and creating differentiated products utilizing our consumer-focused research. This has resulted in a series of new product offerings and new term life rates, which we expect will drive additional sales. Utilizing the AIG Life and Retirement unified distribution organization as well as new distribution opportunities, we intend to expand our distribution footprint for life products.      OTHER OPERATIONS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND OUTLOOK         Mortgage Guaranty (UGC)          Executive Overview    •  Risk Selection — Ensure the high quality of our business through a continuous focus on risk selection and a risk based pricing using a proprietary, multi-variant risk evaluation model and disciplined underwriting approach.   •  Innovation — Development and enhancement of products, technology, and processes, addressing the needs of stakeholders in the mortgage system.  •   Ease of Use — Reduce complexity in the mortgage insurance system.  •  Expense Management — Streamline our processes through the use of technology and shared services.      84      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    Market Conditions and Industry Trends     During the first half of 2013, the U.S. mortgage market showed increasing levels of mortgage originations, home value appreciation and elevated mortgage underwriting standards. These factors, combined with improving U.S. macroeconomic conditions and low interest rates, favorably impacted mortgage loan volumes, the quality of new business written and our overall operating results during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.  However, recent increases in interest rates are expected to reduce new mortgage loan volumes for the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 due to reduced refinancing activity, which we expect to be partially offset by strength in mortgage lending for home purchases. While increasing interest rates generally have an unfavorable impact on new mortgage loan volumes, UGC expects that increasing interest rates will have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written over the last several quarters since refinancing of loans would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the historically low interest rates prevalent during those periods.  In addition, UGC expects cure rates to improve as a result of home value appreciation since such appreciation will encourage homeowners with delinquent mortgages to sell and purchase another home, or to refinance their existing mortgages. We believe the combination of higher persistency and improving cure rates, partially offset by changes in new mortgage loan volumes, will continue to strengthen UGC's operating results throughout 2014.    Strategic Initiatives and Opportunities         Risk Selection     For the remainder of 2013 and during 2014, UGC expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and will differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing a risk-based pricing strategy. This pricing strategy provides UGC's customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with underwriting risk, which we believe will result in an appropriately priced, high-quality book of business. UGC plans to continue to execute this strategy through 2014. The new business generated under this strategy, since 2009, accounts for approximately 51 percent of net premiums earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.      Global Capital Markets     AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. The derivative portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives.  The remaining derivatives portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the DIB and a portion of the legacy hedges for AIG and its subsidiaries. AIGFP's derivatives portfolio consists primarily of interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity derivatives. Additionally, AIGFP has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with our risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity, low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.      Direct Investment Book     The DIB consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities, as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives. We are focused on meeting the DIB's liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB, without relying on resources beyond the DIB. As part of this program management, we may from time to time access the capital markets, including issuing and repurchasing debt, and selling assets on an opportunistic basis, in each case subject to market conditions.     85      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  From time to time, we may utilize cash allocated to the DIB that is not required to meet the risk target for DIB for general corporate purposes unrelated to the DIB.  The DIB's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, U.S. government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities. The value of these assets is impacted by macro-economic trends in U.S. and core European markets, including corporate credit spreads, commercial and residential real estate markets, and to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, among other factors. The majority of these assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings. The DIB has both liabilities that are held at cost and liabilities that are held at fair value. The liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in AIG's credit spreads with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Changes in the fundamental drivers of the fair value of DIB assets and liabilities will create earnings volatility for the DIB on a period-to-period comparative basis.  The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.     86                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Results of Operations  The following section provides a comparative discussion of our Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.

Income from continuing operations before income tax expense was $7.2 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to $8.7 billion for the same period in 2012, and reflected the following:  •pre-tax income from insurance operations (including Mortgage Guaranty, which is reported in Other Operations) of $8.5 billion and $5.4 billion in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively;  •aggregate pre-tax income from GCM and DIB of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively;  •loss on extinguishment of debt of $459 million resulting from redemptions and repurchases of, and cash tender offers for, certain debt securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2013; and •net investment income in 2012 reflected an increase in fair value of AIG's interests in AIA ordinary shares and ML III of $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion; respectively.  For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was (84.2) percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income, effective settlements of certain uncertain tax positions, and decreases primarily in AIG Life and Retirement's capital loss carryforward valuation allowance and certain other valuation allowances associated with foreign jurisdictions. The decrease in the capital loss carryforward valuation allowance was primarily attributable to the actual and projected gains from AIG Life and Retirement's available-for-sale securities. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, these items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.  For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income and investments in partnerships, and decreases primarily in AIG Life and Retirement's capital loss carryforward valuation allowance related to the actual and projected gains from AIG Life and Retirement's available-for-sale securities. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.     88      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to AIG to after-tax operating income attributable to AIG:                                                        Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Net income attributable to AIG       $   2,170     $ 1,856       $   7,107     $ 7,396      (Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense            42       (37 )          (84    )    (280 )    Net loss on sale of divested businesses           –       –           31       2      Uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments           36       12           726       343      Legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters            260       5            (61    )    482      Deferred income tax valuation allowance releases           (1,159    )    (219 )         (2,697    )    (1,795 )    Changes in fair value of AIG Life and Retirement fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, net of interest expense           19       2           83       (31 )    Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains            176       393            1,065       729      Loss on extinguishment of debt           52       –           298       6      Net realized capital gains           (175    )    (386 )         (1,410    )    (489 )    Non-qualifying derivative hedging gains, excluding net realized capital gains            –       (5 )          –       (18 )          After-tax operating income attributable to AIG       $   1,421     $ 1,621       $   5,058     $ 6,345           After-tax operating income attributable to AIG decreased in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to fair value gains on AIG's previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares, ML II, and ML III, discussed above, partially offset by increases in income from insurance operations.  For the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 18.0 percent and 35.5 percent, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 27.7 percent and 32.0 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.     89      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Quarterly and Year-to-Date Segment Results  We report the results of our operations through two reportable segments: AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement.

Factors that affect pre-tax operating income for a specific business segment are discussed in the detailed business segment analysis.     91      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Quarterly and Year-to-date Pre-tax Income for 2013 and 2012    AIG Property Casualty — Pre-tax income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily as a result of improved underwriting results. The improved underwriting results are attributable to lower accident year losses, which reflect the continued shift to higher value business, enhanced risk selection and improved pricing. The improvement in pre-tax income also reflected lower catastrophe losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to decreases in returns on alternative investments and mutual funds. Net investment income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to the strong performance of alternative investments and income associated with the PICC P&C shares.    AIG Life and Retirement — Pre-tax income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to increased fee income from growth in our variable annuity account value and continued active spread management related to our interest rate sensitive businesses. The 2013 periods included a $118 million net increase in pre-tax operating income from adjustments to update certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in our interest-sensitive product lines. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 also included income from legal settlements. These increases were partially offset by the absence of fair value gains recognized in the prior year nine-month period from our investment in ML II, which was liquidated in March 2012. Net realized capital gains decreased in the three-month period and increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to gains on different volumes of sales activity in connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards, which were partially offset by the triggering of additional loss recognition reserves, reflected in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred, from the subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds from these sales at lower yields.    Other Operations — Other operations reported a pre-tax loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to pre-tax income in the same period of 2012 primarily due to decreases in pre-tax income from GCM and DIB. The pre-tax income in 2012 included fair value gains from our previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares and ML III. Other operations reported a pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to pre-tax income in the same period in 2012. The pre-tax loss in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 included a loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the redemptions and repurchases of, and cash tender offers, for certain debt securities, partially offset by an increase in pre-tax income from GCM and Mortgage Guaranty. The pre-tax income in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 included fair value gains from our previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares and ML III.  Mortgage Guaranty's pre-tax operating income increased in the three- and nine-month periods of September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012 due to higher net premiums earned in the first-lien business and a decline in newly reported delinquencies and improving cure rates.     92      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table presents reconciliations of pre-tax income (loss) to pre-tax operating income (loss) by reportable segment and after-tax operating income attributable to AIG, which are non-GAAP measures.

Commercial Insurance provides insurance solutions for large and small businesses. Commercial Insurance products are distributed through a network of independent retail and wholesale brokers, branches, and through an independent agency network in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions.    Consumer Insurance provides personal insurance solutions for individuals, organizations and families. Consumer Insurance products are distributed through agents and brokers, as well as through direct marketing, partner organizations and the internet.  The   Other category consists primarily of certain run-off lines of business, including excess workers' compensation written on a stand-alone basis, reserves for asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior) claims, and certain environmental liability businesses written prior to 2004. It also includes a portion of AIG Property Casualty expenses relating to global corporate initiatives, expense allocations from AIG Parent not attributable to the Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance operating segments, unallocated net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, and other income (expense).     95                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  See Part I. Item 1. Business — AIG Property Casualty in AIG's 2012 Annual Report for further discussion of AIG Property Casualty's products and geographic regions where it distributes its products.  We are developing new value-based metrics that provide management with measures to evaluate our profitability, such as a risk-adjusted profitability model. Along with underwriting results, this risk-adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital and net investment income. We believe that such performance measures will allow us to better assess the true economic returns of our business.       AIG Property Casualty Quarterly and Year-to-Date 2013 Highlights     Net premiums written decreased by one percent for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and an increase in specific Casualty reinsurance arrangements to better manage our exposures. This decrease was partially offset by the growth of new business and rate increases.  Also, in the first quarter of 2013, we began to recognize ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period. The negative impact on net premiums written from this change in the first quarter of 2013 began to reverse in the second quarter of 2013 and will continue to reverse throughout the rest of 2013. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, the impact of the change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written increased net premiums written by $204 million, while for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, this impact decreased net premiums written by $122 million. Excluding the impact of this change and the effect of foreign exchange, Commercial Insurance net premiums written were unchanged and increased by approximately two percent for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Excluding the impact of this change and the effect of foreign exchange, Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased by approximately four percent in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The loss ratio improved by 4.1 points and 3.3 points for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit from positive pricing trends and the continued effect of the execution of our strategic initiatives, which we began implementing in the second half of 2011. These improvements included decreases in net adverse prior year development, including related premium adjustments, as well as lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increases in severe losses of $71 million and $46 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 net adverse prior year development included $136 million of adverse development from Storm Sandy. Additionally, losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, benefitted from an increase in reserve discount.  The acquisition ratio increased by 0.2 points for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 and was unchanged for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due in both cases to changes in business mix and costs in growth-targeted lines of business in Consumer Insurance, which were partially offset by decreases in the Commercial Insurance acquisition ratio related to changes in business mix and the timing of insurance-related assessments.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.5 points and 0.6 points for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of the increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and reduced costs for infrastructure projects. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, the lower net premiums earned base contributed approximately 0.5 points to the general operating expense ratio.  Net investment income decreased by four percent for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower returns on alternative investments and mutual funds. Net investment income increased by seven percent for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in alternative investment returns and income associated with the PICC P&C shares that are accounted for under the fair value option.  Cash dividends paid to AIG Parent were $716 million and $1.5 billion in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively.     96      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF

written.    AIG Property Casualty Quarterly Results  Pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an improvement in underwriting results, which was partially offset by a decrease in net investment income. The improvement in underwriting results in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year reflects improved current accident year losses, decreases in net adverse development and lower catastrophe losses. Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower returns on alternative investments and mutual funds reflective of overall lower market performance for the period. Net adverse development including premium adjustments was $72 million and $145 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Catastrophe losses were $222 million and $261 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  See Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense for further discussion of prior year development.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to changes in business mix in both Commercial and Consumer Insurance.  General operating expenses decreased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense and reduced costs for infrastructure projects. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the cost of our employee incentive     98      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  plans of $47 million, primarily due to the alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock performance. Bad debt expense and infrastructure project expenses, in the aggregate, decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 by $61 million from $127 million in the same period in the prior year.    AIG Property Casualty Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an improvement in underwriting results and an increase in net investment income. The improvement in underwriting results in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year reflected an improvement in current accident year losses, decreases in net adverse developments as well as lower catastrophe losses. Net investment income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in alternative investment returns and income associated with the PICC P&C shares that are accounted for under the fair value option. The asset diversification strategies that we executed during 2012 enabled us to maintain similar yields in the portfolio despite the continued low interest rate environment in 2013. Net adverse development including premium adjustments was $199 million and $329 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Catastrophe losses were $579 million and $669 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of certain guaranty funds and other assessments in Commercial Insurance, which were partially offset by an increase in acquisition expenses in Consumer Insurance due to the change in business mix.  General operating expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans of $158 million and a $42 million increase due to the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan. The increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans was primarily due to the alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock performance, and accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible individuals in the 2013 share-based plan. This was partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense and reduced costs for infrastructure projects. Bad debt expense and infrastructure project expenses, in the aggregate, decreased to $152 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to $324 million in the same period in the prior year.    Commercial Insurance Quarterly Results  Pre-tax operating income increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an improvement in underwriting results in the third quarter of 2013, which was partially offset by a decrease in allocated net investment income primarily due to a decrease in risk-free rates. Commercial Insurance underwriting results improved primarily due to improved current accident year losses, rate increases, enhanced risk selection, lower catastrophe losses, and a decrease in net adverse developments. The current accident year losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 also included severe losses of $211 million compared to severe losses of $120 million incurred in the same period in the prior year. Net adverse development, including related premium adjustments, was $104 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to $123 million in the same period in the prior year. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, catastrophe losses were $182 million compared to $239 million in the same period in 2012.  Acquisition expenses decreased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the change in business mix.  General operating expenses decreased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense, which was partially offset by the increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed.    Commercial Insurance Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to underwriting income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013     99      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  compared to an underwriting loss in the same period of 2012, partially offset by a decrease in allocated net investment income as a result of a decrease in risk-free rates. Commercial Insurance generated underwriting income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to an underwriting loss in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to improved current accident year losses, rate increases, enhanced risk selection and lower catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by an increase in net adverse development. The current accident year losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 also included severe losses of $309 million compared to the severe losses of $230 million incurred in the same period of the prior year. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, catastrophe losses were $522 million compared to $603 million in the same period in 2012. Net adverse development, including related premium adjustments was $245 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, which includes $165 million of adverse development related to Storm Sandy, compared to $153 million in the prior year. The adverse development related to Storm Sandy resulted from higher severities on a small number of existing large and complex commercial claims. These increased severities were driven by a number of factors, including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown New York metropolitan area. Additionally, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, benefitted from an increase in reserve discount.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of guaranty funds and other assessments, as well as change in business mix.  General operating expenses increased slightly in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed, which was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly Results  Pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in underwriting income and allocated net investment income. Underwriting income decreased due to the combination of higher accident year losses, reflecting higher warranty retail program losses, higher catastrophe losses, and investment in strategic business expansion in growth economy nations, partially offset by improvement of auto underwriting income, higher net favorable development, and the change in business mix towards higher value products. Allocated net investment income decreased primarily due to a decrease in risk-free rates. Catastrophe losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 were $40 million, compared to $22 million during the same period in the prior year. Net favorable development was $30 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to net favorable development of $2 million in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the acquisition expenses increased due to the change in business mix. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, was $110 million for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These expenses, while not deferrable, are expected to generate business that has an average expected overall persistency of approximately five years and, in Japan, approximately nine years.  General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, general operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to investment in strategic business expansion in growth economy nations and the increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed.    Consumer Insurance Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in both underwriting income and allocated net investment income. Underwriting income decreased due to higher warranty retail program losses, increases in acquisition expenses, investment in strategic business expansion in growth economy nations, and the change in business mix, offset in part by improved underwriting performance of auto and personal property, lower catastrophe losses and higher net favorable development. Allocated net investment income decreased due to a decrease in risk-free rates. Catastrophe losses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 were $57 million, compared to $66 million during the same period in the prior year. Net favorable development was $125 million in the nine-month period ended     100      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  September 30, 2013, compared to $53 million in the prior year period. The first nine months of 2013 included approximately $51 million of favorable development from Storm Sandy driven primarily by the reduction of reserves for excess flood policies indicated from completed property inspections and lower than expected severity on certain other policy claims.  Acquisition expenses increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the change in business mix and costs in growth-targeted lines of business. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 were $335 million, compared to $319 million during the same period in the prior year. These expenses, while not deferrable, are expected to generate business that has an average expected overall persistency of approximately five years and, in Japan, approximately nine years. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, direct marketing expenses increased by approximately $15 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.  General operating expenses decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to reduced costs for infrastructure projects, which were partially offset by the increase in employee incentive plan expense previously discussed and the strategic expansion in growth economy nations.    AIG Property Casualty Net Premiums Written     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty net premiums written by major line of business:                                                                      Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,               Percentage Change     Percentage Change       (in millions)     2013     2012      2013     2012            Commercial Insurance                                                  Casualty       $   1,924     $ 2,195      (12 )%     $   6,278     $ 6,728      (7 )%    Property          1,350       1,063     27          3,803       3,482     9      Specialty          898       873     3          2,752       2,727     1      Financial lines          1,050       968     8          3,168       2,953     7          Total net premiums written       $   5,222     $ 5,099     2 %     $   16,001     $ 15,890     1 %          Consumer Insurance                                                  Accident & Health       $   1,651     $ 1,819      (9 )%     $   5,089     $ 5,322      (4 )%    Personal lines          1,790       1,811     (1 )        5,274       5,433     (3 )          Total net premiums written       $   3,441     $ 3,630      (5 )%     $   10,363     $ 10,755      (4 )%          Other          (3    )    (17 )   82          (4    )    (18 )   78          Total AIG Property Casualty net premiums written       $   8,660     $ 8,712      (1 )%     $   26,360     $ 26,627      (1 )%              101      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY          Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Premiums Written  During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, Commercial Insurance continued to focus on the execution of its strategic objectives.  Casualty net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection, particularly in the Americas and EMEA, as well as to increase specific reinsurance purchases to better manage our exposures. Changes in reinsurance strategy decreased net premiums written by $38 million and $173 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. In addition, Casualty net premiums written decreased due to less additional premium in the loss sensitive business in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013. The additional premium was $3 million and $66 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We implemented rate increases in retained business, especially in the U.S., that partially offset these premium decreases.  Property net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to growth in new business across all regions, favorable retention in renewal businesses and increases in coverage limits and changes to our per-risk reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure. The increase in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 also reflected a $159 million benefit from the impact of a change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written described below. Catastrophe-exposed businesses in the Americas also benefitted from rate increases.     102                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  Effective January 1, 2013, we began to recognize the annual ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period. Previously, we recognized ceded premiums written on these agreements based on the quarterly contractual remittance requirements, and recorded an adjustment at the end of the contract term to reflect the actual ceded premiums written amounts. This change resulted in the acceleration of ceded premiums written to earlier quarters, but had only a de minimis effect on net premiums earned. As a result of this change, ceded premiums written for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 decreased by $159 million compared to the same period in the prior year. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, ceded premiums written increased by $42 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The impact on net premiums written from this change will continue to reverse throughout the rest of 2013.  Net premiums written also reflected the timing of catastrophe bond issuances. We have continued our strategy of improving the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. As part of this strategy, during the third quarter of 2013, we entered into a five-year catastrophe bond transaction, which will provide $125 million of indemnity protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. The transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through June 2018. During the first quarter of 2013, we secured a three-year catastrophe bond providing for up to $400 million in protection against U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes to the extent both industry losses and our actual losses exceed specific thresholds. The bond transactions reduced net premiums written by $44 million and $140 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively. Our previous catastrophe bond issuance occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Specialty net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to rate increases in environmental business, small-and medium-sized enterprise markets in the Americas region, new business growth in EMEA, as well as the restructuring of our reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, which increased net premiums written by $68 million and $133 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Financial lines net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products, particularly in the EMEA region as well as an improved rate environment globally. Global professional indemnity net premiums written increased by $11 million and $71 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, due to improved rates, strong new business growth and the restructuring of our reinsurance program, as part of our decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Premiums Written  Consumer Insurance net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. The decrease for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 also reflected the effect of a change in the timing of recognizing ceded written premiums for excess of loss reinsurance and the catastrophe bond issuances discussed above. Excluding these items, net premiums written in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year as the business continued to build momentum through multiple distribution channels and continuing focus on direct marketing. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net premiums written generated by direct marketing increased by approximately 3.1 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, and accounted for approximately 15.7 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively, of Consumer Insurance net premiums written.  A&H net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased slightly in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to our focus on the growth of Fuji Life products, direct marketing, individual A&H in Asia Pacific, and travel business which continued to increase in most geographies across the globe. This was partially offset by the non-renewal of several programs in the U.S. region that did not meet underwriting targets. Americas continued its strategy of repositioning U.S. direct marketing operations and maintaining our pricing discipline and underwriting targets. Net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in     103      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  the prior year, primarily due to the growth of Fuji Life products, direct marketing, travel business and individual A&H in Asia Pacific.  Personal lines net premiums written, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were driven by growth in U.S. private client group and warranty business, automobile products and the continued execution of our strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business in non-automobile products. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, the impact of the change in the timing of recognizing the excess of loss ceded premiums written increased net premiums written by $28 million, while for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, the impact of this change decreased net premiums written by $58 million. In addition, the impact of the timing of the catastrophe bond issuances was $8 million and $28 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the prior year periods, respectively.

This was partially offset by decreases in casualty businesses reflecting the execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection and the effect of the timing of the catastrophe bond issuances which was approximately $55 million and approximately $175 million, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively. Additionally, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, the change in timing of recognizing ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements, discussed above, increased net premiums written by approximately $147 million, while it decreased net premiums written for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 by approximately $2 million.  Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased primarily due to an increase in Consumer Insurance, reflecting growth of Fuji Life products and direct marketing business in Japan. The expansion of business in Asia Pacific countries outside of Japan also continued in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, supported by growth in individual personal accident insurance, direct marketing and personal lines products. Commercial Insurance increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 in the Asia Pacific region primarily due to organic growth and rate increases in Property, Specialty, and Casualty. In addition, our decision to retain more favorable risks in Property and Financial lines increased net premiums written during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013.  EMEA net premiums written increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting Commercial Insurance growth due to new business growth, particularly in Property and Financial lines, a change in reinsurance strategies to retain more favorable risks in Property and Financial lines, and rate improvements on retained business, as well as growth in Consumer Insurance personal accident, travel, warranty, automobile and specialty personal lines products. Additionally, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, the change in timing of recognizing ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements, discussed above, increased net premiums written by approximately $55 million, while for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, it decreased net premiums written by approximately $118 million.     105

Severe losses are defined as non-catastrophe individual first party losses and surety losses greater than $10 million, net of related reinsurance.     Commercial Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Ratios  The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, improved by 4.2 points and 5.1 points for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012.  The improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 reflects the realization of benefits from the continued execution of our multi-faceted strategy to enhance risk selection, pricing discipline, exposure management and claims processing. Although the execution of these strategies resulted in a reduction of Casualty net premiums written in both the Americas and EMEA regions, it also improved the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, for Financial lines improved due to rate strengthening, restructuring and re-underwriting of certain products. Severe losses in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 represented approximately 4.1 points and 2.0 points, respectively, compared to 2.3 points and 1.5 points in the same periods in the prior year, respectively, and are included in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. Net adverse development including related premium adjustments, represented 2.1 points and 1.7 points of the loss ratio in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to net adverse development of 2.7 points and 1.1 points in the respective prior-year periods. Adverse development on Storm Sandy added 1.2 points to the loss ratio for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.  The acquisition ratio increased by 0.2 points in the three- month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a change in business mix. The acquisition ratio decreased by 0.7 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 primarily due to a change in business mix and the timing of insurance-related assessments.     109      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.2 points and 0.3 points, respectively, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in employee incentive compensation plan expense, previously discussed, was offset by decreases in bad debt expenses. The lower net premiums earned base contributed approximately 0.2 points and 0.3 points, respectively, to the general operating expense ratio. The increase in employee incentive plan expense contributed approximately 0.7 points and 0.9 points, respectively, to the increase in the general operating expense ratio. A reduction in bad debt expense in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 represented a decrease to the general operating ratio of approximately 0.7 points and 0.4 points, respectively, over the same periods in 2012.    Consumer Insurance Quarterly and Year-to-Date Ratios  The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, increased by 1.4 points and 2.4 points, respectively, for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012.  The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased by 0.8 points and 0.7 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher losses associated with a warranty retail program, which increased the loss ratio by 1.0 point and 0.8 points, respectively. This was partially offset by improvements in automobile and personal property, as a result of rate and underwriting actions taken in current and prior years. Storm Sandy favorable development reduced the loss ratio by 0.5 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.  The acquisition ratio increased by 0.4 points and 1.3 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the change in business mix and higher costs in growth-targeted lines of business.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.2 points and 0.4 points in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The general operating expense ratio increased primarily due to the increase in employee incentive compensation expense previously discussed for both periods. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, the increase in employee incentive compensation expense was partially offset by lower infrastructure project costs.    Other Category  We incurred higher general operating expenses in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to personnel costs, partially offset by the reduced costs for infrastructure projects that are not specific to either Commercial Insurance or Consumer Insurance. This contributed approximately 0.3 points to the decrease to the AIG Property Casualty general operating expense ratio in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. We continue to invest in a number of infrastructure projects, including the implementation of global finance and information systems, compliance with the regulatory requirements of the FRB, legal entity restructuring, and underwriting and claims improvement initiatives.  We incurred higher general operating expenses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily related to our implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in Japan, which contributed approximately 0.2 points in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 to the AIG Property Casualty general operating expense ratio.     110      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY     AIG Property Casualty Investing and Other Results     The following table presents AIG Property Casualty's investing and other results:                                                                      Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)       2013     2012       2013     2012            Net investment income                                                    Commercial Insurance       $   618     $ 688      (10 )%       $   1,886     $ 2,130      (11 )%    Consumer Insurance           89       109     (18 )          279       340     (18 )    Other           472       430     10            1,682       1,133     48          Total net investment income            1,179       1,227     (4 )         3,847       3,603     7      Net realized capital gains (losses)            (12      )   161     NM           73       49     49      Other income — net           (3       )   2     NM           10       6     67          Investing and other results       $   1,164     $ 1,390      (16 )%       $   3,930     $ 3,658     7 %           We manage and account for our invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements. Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as the Other category. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments.  Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and the Consumer Insurance operating segments are assigned to the Other category. Commencing in the first quarter of 2013, we began applying similar duration and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) to the allocated capital of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance as is applied to loss reserves.  Net realized capital gains (losses) and Other income (expense) — net are not allocated to Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, but are reported as part of the Other category.    Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Investment Income  Net investment income over time is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of cash flows, the interest rate environment and changes in overall asset allocation. Certain of our structured securities and our additional investment in PICC P&C shares acquired in the PICC P&C rights offering are accounted for under the fair value option, which may also increase the volatility of our net investment income. Net investment income decreased by $48 million, or 4 percent, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the lower returns on alternative investments and mutual funds. Net investment income increased by $244 million, or 7 percent, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the strong performance in alternative investments.  Corporate debt securities continues to be our largest asset category. We continued to reduce our concentration in lower yielding tax-exempt municipal bond holdings and focus on risk-weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities. This asset diversification has achieved similar average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity investments were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to execute our investment strategy in 2013 to meet our liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  Net investment income from investment categories other than debt securities decreased by $44 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, the alternative investment and mutual fund performance decreased by approximately $40 million as a result of overall lower market performance for the period. Net investment income from investment categories other than debt securities increased by $299 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013,     111      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG PROPERTY CASUALTY  compared to the same period in 2012. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, approximately $240 million was attributable to the strong performance of alternative investments in the period. Additionally, net investment income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 includes $35 million and $93 million, respectively, in gains related to the PICC P&C shares which was accounted for under the fair value option. Income from the life settlement portfolios also increased by approximately $13 million and $53 million, respectively, during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012.    Quarterly Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital loss in the three- month period ended September 30, 2013 was driven by impairment charges on life settlement contracts of approximately $62 million, partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities of $46 million.  Net realized capital gains for the three-month period ended September 30, 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities in the amount of $169 million. This was partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $31 million, primarily attributable to publicly traded and privately held equity securities in the Japan portfolios and a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities. In addition, impairment charges of $59 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period.    Year-to-Date Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 were driven by gains of $205 million recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities, partially offset by impairment charges on life settlement contracts of approximately $149 million.  Net realized capital gains for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity securities of $490 million, which were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $330 million, primarily attributable to a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities, and alternative investments and equity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. In addition, impairment charges of $174 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period.

We regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pre-tax operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years' estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years' estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.  The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance, less applicable discount for future investment income.

While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of September 30, 2013. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.  The following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves:                                                         Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,        (in millions)      2013      2012       2013      2012            Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of period         $   65,592     $ 68,365         $   68,782     $ 70,825      Foreign exchange effect           29       351           (880    )    (261 )    Other, including dispositions           –       –           (79    )    –      Change due to NICO reinsurance transaction            19       22            85       55      Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                      Current year, undiscounted           5,539       6,079           16,330       17,982      Prior years, undiscounted*            100       167            260       278      Change in discount           6       6           16       (69 )          Losses and loss expenses incurred            5,645       6,252            16,606       18,191          Losses and loss expenses paid           6,507       6,903            19,736       20,723          Net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period       $   64,778     $ 68,087       $   64,778     $ 68,087            * See tables below for details of prior year development by business unit, accident year and major class of business.

Also for the same periods, the adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior were primarily driven by loss development on toxic tort and construction general liability claims.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2012, the favorable development in accident year 2011 was driven primarily by the favorable development on natural catastrophes, primarily the Japan Earthquake, and the adverse development in accident years 2003 and prior was primarily the result of the increase in reserves on environmental business (policies written after 1987).  For certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverables, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to AIG. These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the table above.  The following table summarizes development, (favorable) or unfavorable, of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years, net of reinsurance, by major class of business:                                    Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,        (in millions)      2013      2012       2013      2012            Prior accident year development by major class of business:                                        Commercial Insurance:                                        Excess casualty — U.S.       $   (104    )  $ (12 )     $   (114    )  $ 122      Environmental (post 1986 – ongoing) — U.S.           112       53           112       160      Healthcare — U.S.           –       23           –       68      Primary workers' compensation — U.S.            1       42            1       45      Property — U.S.           (17    )    (23 )         (79    )    (85 )    Primary casualty — U.S.:                                        Loss-sensitive            3       74            83       68      Other           208       66           267       142      Natural catastrophes:                                        U.S.            (37    )    –            142       (155 )    International           (24    )    23           (47    )    (67 )    All other, net:                                        U.S.            (25    )    43            (19    )    47      International           (12    )    (100 )         (45    )    (140 )          Total all other, net           (37    )    (57 )         (64    )    (93 )          Total Commercial Insurance           105       189           301       205          Total Consumer Insurance           (30    )    (2 )         (125    )    (53 )          Other                                      Asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior)                                        U.S.            (2    )    –            31       70      International           –       –           11       5          Total asbestos and environmental           (2    )    –           42       75      Environmental (1987 – 2003) — U.S.           –       24           37       166      All other, net            –       –            –       (12 )          Total Other           (2    )    24           79       229          Total AIG Property Casualty           73       211           255       381          Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty           27       (44 )         5       (103 )          Total         $   100     $ 167         $   260     $ 278              115                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE   Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Loss Development  In determining the loss development from prior accident years, we analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues.  For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in the Commercial Insurance operating segment that were partially offset by net favorable development in the Consumer Insurance operating segment. The net adverse development in Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on domestic primary casualty mostly due to the increase in reserves in construction general liability lines and by adverse development in the domestic environmental business (policies written after 1987) including adverse development on toxic tort claims in that line of business and the domestic excess casualty business. The adverse development on those classes was partially offset by favorable other claims emergence in the domestic excess casualty line of business. In addition, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 included adverse development in Commercial Insurance, attributable to catastrophe-related domestic property exposures primarily due to the increase in reserves for Storm Sandy.  The favorable development in Consumer Insurance was due to lower than expected losses in Personal lines, including decreases in reserves for Storm Sandy, and non-catastrophe losses.  For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in Commercial Insurance and Other, which was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves in Consumer Insurance. The net adverse development in Commercial Insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on primary casualty and domestic environmental business (policies written after 1987), partially offset by favorable development in domestic property exposures and catastrophe losses. The favorable development in Consumer Insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe losses in Personal lines.  AIG Property Casualty recognized additional premiums on loss-sensitive business of $3 million and $83 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to returned premiums of $66 million and $52 million in the same periods in the prior year, respectively. In addition, we incurred reinstatement premiums of $2 million and $27 million for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, associated with the development on prior years' catastrophes.  See AIG Property Casualty Results herein and Other Operations — Other Operations Results — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion of net loss development.    Asbestos and Environmental Reserves     The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability.  As described more fully in the 2012 Annual Report, AIG's reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground-up analysis performed periodically. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, AIG increased its gross asbestos reserves by $33 million and its net asbestos reserves by $17 million to reflect a small amount of uncollectible reinsurance, minor changes to reserves from two accounts and accretion of discount. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, AIG increased its gross environmental reserves by $61 million and its net environmental reserves by $38 million as a result of actuarial analyses performed during the year as well as development on one large account.     116      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, AIG Property Casualty also has asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $121 million gross and $100 million net as of September 30, 2013. The asbestos reserves relating to non-U.S. risks written by non-U.S. entities were $140 million gross and $116 million net as of December 31, 2012.  The following table provides a summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims:                                                As of or for the Nine Months Ended September 30,      2013      2012        (in millions)       Gross       Net      Gross      Net            Asbestos:                                      Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year       $   4,896         $   427     $ 5,226   $ 537      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                                       Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts            –             89        –     74      Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts(a)             –             (4    )     –     (20 )          Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance            –              85        –     54          Dispositions           (12    )           (12    )     –      –      Loss and loss expenses incurred:                                       Undiscounted           (5    )          4        –      –      Change in discount            38             17       69     32          Losses and loss expenses incurred(b)           33              21       69     32          Losses and loss expenses paid(b)            (347    )          (112    )    (289 )   (180 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period       $   4,570           $   409     $ 5,006   $ 443          Environmental:                                       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year         $   309           $   163     $ 204   $ 119      Dispositions           (1    )          (1    )     –      –      Losses and loss expenses incurred           61             38       150     75          Losses and loss expenses paid           (69    )           (43    )    (31 )   (21 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period         $   300           $   157     $ 323   $ 173          Combined:                                       Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at beginning of year         $   5,205           $   590     $ 5,430   $ 656      Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance:                                      Paid losses recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts            –             89        –     74      Re-estimation of amount recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts             –             (4    )     –     (20 )          Change in net loss reserves due to retroactive reinsurance            –              85        –     54          Dispositions           (13    )           (13    )     –      –      Losses and loss expenses incurred:                                       Undiscounted           56             42       150     75      Change in discount           38             17       69     32          Losses and loss expenses incurred           94              59       219     107          Losses and loss expenses paid           (416    )           (155    )    (320 )   (201 )          Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense at end of period         $   4,870           $   566     $ 5,329   $ 616            (a) Re-estimation of amounts recoverable under retroactive reinsurance contracts includes effect of changes in reserve estimates and changes in discount.

Key aspects of the new structure are distinct product lines, shared annuity and life operations platforms and a unified all-channel distribution organization with access to all AIG Life and Retirement products. During the first quarter of 2013, we fully implemented these changes to reflect our new structure and now present our operating results in the two operating segments described below. All prior period amounts presented have been revised to reflect the new structure.    Retail   Institutional          The Retail operating segment product lines include Life Insurance and Accident and Health (A&H), Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions, Brokerage Services and Retail Mutual Funds. These products are marketed under the following brands — American General, AGLA, Western National and SunAmerica. Life Insurance and A&H:   Primary products include term life insurance, universal life insurance and A&H products. Life insurance and A&H products are primarily distributed through independent marketing organizations and independent insurance agents under the American General brand. Career agents distribute Life Insurance and A&H products under the AGLA brand. AIG Direct is a proprietary direct-to-consumer distributor of term life insurance and A&H products. The Life Insurance and A&H product line will continue to focus on innovative product development and delivering differentiated life insurance solutions to producers and customers. Fixed Annuities:   Products are primarily marketed under the Western National brand and include single and flexible premium deferred fixed annuities and single premium immediate annuities. The Fixed Annuities business line maintains its leading industry position in the bank distribution channel by designing products in cooperation with banks and offering an efficient and flexible administration platform. Retirement Income Solutions:   Primary products include variable and fixed index annuities that provide asset accumulation and lifetime income through innovative design and hedging strategies. Marketed under the SunAmerica Retirement Markets brand, variable annuities are distributed through banks and national, regional and independent broker-dealer firms. Fixed index annuities are distributed through banks under the Western National brand and through career and independent insurance agents under the American General brand. Brokerage Services:   Includes the operations of Advisor Group, which is one of the largest networks of independent financial advisors in the U.S. Brands include Royal Alliance, SagePoint, FSC Securities and, since its acquisition in November 2012, Woodbury Financial Services, Inc. (Woodbury Financial). Retail Mutual Funds:    Includes the mutual fund and related administration and servicing operations of SunAmerica Asset Management.      The Institutional operating segment product lines include Group Retirement, Group Benefits and Institutional Markets. These products and services are marketed through a variety of brands described below. Group Retirement:   Products are marketed under the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC) brand and include fixed and variable group annuities, group mutual funds, and group administrative and compliance services. VALIC career financial advisors and independent financial advisors provide retirement plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services. Group Benefits:   In 2012, AIG Life and Retirement and AIG Property Casualty combined their U.S. group benefits businesses, and the combined business now operates as AIG Benefit Solutions. This business will continue to market a wide range of insurance and benefits products for employees (both employer-paid and voluntary) and affinity groups. Primary product offerings include life insurance, accidental death, business travel accident, disability income, medical excess (stop loss), dental, vision and worksite universal life, critical illness and accident. Institutional Markets:   Products primarily include stable value wrap products, structured settlement and terminal funding annuities, high net worth products, corporate-and bank-owned life insurance and guaranteed investment contracts (GICs). These products are marketed under the American General brand through independent marketing organizations and structured settlement brokers. Institutional Markets has a disciplined and opportunistic approach to growth in these product lines.        118      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      AIG Life and Retirement Quarterly and Year-to-Date 2013 Highlights     Net flows on investment products improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to continued strong sales of variable annuities in our Retirement Income Solutions product line and increased Retail Mutual Fund sales. Net flows from our Fixed Annuities product line for the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, while still negative, improved compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of the recent modest rise in interest rates.  Pre-tax operating income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher fee income from growth in variable annuity separate accounts under management and active spread management in our interest rate sensitive product lines. The 2013 periods also included a $118 million net increase in pre-tax operating income from adjustments to update certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in our interest-sensitive product lines. These adjustments increased pre-tax operating income in our Retail operating segment by $198 million and decreased pre-tax operating income in our Institutional operating segment by $80 million in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013. See AIG Life and Retirement Reserves and DAC/VOBA for additional discussion of updated estimated gross profit assumptions. The increases in pre-tax operating income compared to the same periods of the prior year also reflected additional expenses recorded in the 2012 periods related to the resolution of multi-state regulatory examinations of death claims practices and a comprehensive review of reserves for the GIC portfolio.  Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) included loss recognition for certain of our traditional fixed-rate products, including payout annuities, which required us to record additional future policy benefit reserves in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, to reflect lower future investment returns from reinvestment of investment sale proceeds. See AIG Life and Retirement Reserves and DAC/VOBA – Other Reserve Changes for additional discussion of loss recognition.  Legal settlements with financial institutions that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which AIG and its subsidiaries realized losses during the financial crisis resulted in income of $467 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.  Net realized capital gains from investment sales to utilize capital loss carryforwards continued and increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year; however, reinvestment of these sales proceeds at lower current yields has contributed to lower future investment returns, pressuring spreads in interest sensitive product lines, and resulting in loss recognition for certain traditional product lines in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.  Dividends paid by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries to AIG Parent were $1.2 billion in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, as we continue to pursue capital efficiency and leverage our streamlined legal structure. Dividends and loan repayments paid by AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries to AIG Parent totaled $3.1 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.     119      Table of Contents   ITEM 2

Prior period amounts were conformed to the current period presentation. These changes did not affect pre-tax operating income or pre-tax income. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.       AIG Life and Retirement Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting higher fee income from variable annuities driven by growth in separate account assets under management, and continued active spread management in interest rate sensitive product lines. Pre-tax operating income in the 2013 periods included a net increase of $118 million from adjustments to update gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items in our interest-sensitive product lines. Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 was lower than the same period in the prior year due to lower income from alternative investments and other enhancements, as well as lower yields resulting from portfolio cash flows and investment sale proceeds being reinvested at yields lower than the average yield of the existing portfolio. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, net investment income was down slightly compared to the same period in the prior year, due to ML II fair value gains recognized in 2012, reinvestment at lower rates and lower calls and other enhancements, partially offset by higher income from alternative investments. The increase in pre-tax operating income for both periods compared to the same periods in the prior year also reflected additional expenses recorded in the same periods in 2012, which were related to the resolution of multi-state regulatory examinations of death claims practices in the Retail operating segment and a comprehensive review of reserves for the GIC portfolio in the Institutional operating segment.    Retail Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income for our Retail operating segment increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, due in part to higher fee income in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, which reflected growth in separate account assets under management driven by strong sales and positive equity market performance. Base spreads (defined as net investment income excluding alternative investments and other enhancements, less interest credited) improved for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of active spread management in our interest-sensitive product lines. Pre-tax operating income for the Retail operating segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 included $198 million of net favorable adjustments to update estimated gross profit assumptions for annuity spreads, surrender rates and life insurance mortality. See AIG Life and Retirement Reserves and DAC/VOBA for additional discussion of estimated gross profit assumptions. The increases in Other income and in Other acquisition and insurance expenses in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year included additional activity in our Brokerage Services product line principally due to the acquisition of Woodbury Financial in November 2012. Pre-tax operating income for the Retail operating segment in the 2012 periods included $66 million of expenses related to the resolution of multi-state regulatory examinations of death claims practices.     121                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT    Institutional Quarterly and Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income for our Institutional operating segment increased in the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, due in part to higher fee income in the Group Retirement product line, which benefited from growth in separate account assets under management driven by favorable equity market performance. In addition, we continued active spread management in our interest rate sensitive product lines, which included lowering renewal crediting rates and disciplined new business pricing, particularly in our Group Retirement product line. The increases to pre-tax operating income for the Institutional operating segment compared to the same periods in the prior year were partially offset by an $80 million unfavorable adjustment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 primarily due to updated estimated gross profit assumptions for annuity spreads in the Group Retirement product line. See AIG Life and Retirement Reserves and DAC/VOBA for additional discussion of estimated gross profit assumptions. The increases in pre-tax operating income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year also reflected $110 million of additional interest credited expense recorded in the same periods of 2012 resulting from a comprehensive review of reserves for the GIC portfolio.    AIG Life and Retirement Premiums, Deposits and Net Flows       Premiums and Deposits  Premiums increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily from higher structured settlement and terminal funding annuity premiums in the Institutional Markets product line and higher immediate annuity premiums in the Fixed Annuities product line.  Premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums and deposits is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance, investment-type annuity contracts, GICs and mutual funds.  The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:                                                         Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Premiums and deposits       $   8,422     $ 4,785       $   20,767     $ 15,779      Deposits            (7,543    )    (4,102 )          (18,304    )    (13,514 )    Other           (158    )    (99 )         (473    )    (435 )          Premiums       $   721     $ 584       $   1,990     $ 1,830           The following table presents premiums and deposits by operating segment and product line:                                                                      Three Months Ended September 30,          Nine Months Ended September 30,                Percentage Change      Percentage Change       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Retail                                                            Life Insurance and A&H       $   822     $ 819     – %       $   2,497     $ 2,500     – %    Fixed Annuities           1,188       173     NM           1,919       1,222     57      Retirement Income Solutions            2,460       1,056     133            6,106       3,570     71      Retail Mutual Funds           1,633       740     121           3,682       2,108     75      Closed blocks            30       31     (3 )          81       111     (27 )          Total premiums and deposits       $   6,133     $ 2,819     118 %     $   14,285     $ 9,511     50 %          Institutional                                                          Group Retirement         $   1,838     $ 1,623     13 %     $   5,283     $ 5,205     1 %    Institutional Markets           293       178     65           697       553     26      Group Benefits            158       165     (4 )          502       510     (2 )          Total premiums and deposits           2,289       1,966     16           6,482       6,268     3          Total Life and Retirement premiums and deposits       $   8,422     $ 4,785     76 %     $   20,767     $ 15,779     32 %              122                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT       Net Flows  Net flows are presented for our investment product lines, which include Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement. Annuities net flows included in Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Mutual fund net flows included in Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement represent deposits less withdrawals. Net flows presented below exclude activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities, which have reserves of approximately $6 billion at September 30, 2013.  The following table summarizes net flows for our investment product lines:                                                          Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,       (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Net flows                                        Fixed Annuities       $   (104    )  $ (1,149 )     $   (2,367    )  $ (2,976 )    Retirement Income Solutions          1,638       274          3,501       1,197      Retail Mutual Funds          1,119       364          2,108       943      Group Retirement          (159    )    52          (575    )    517          Total net flows       $   2,494     $ (459 )     $   2,667     $ (319 )             Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Flows  Total net flows from annuities and mutual funds for our investment product lines increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year. A discussion of the significant variances in net flows for each of these product lines, including variances in premiums and deposits which is a key component of net flows, follows.    Retail  Fixed Annuities net flows and premiums and deposits showed improvement in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to recent modest increases in interest rates and steepening of the yield curve, which made fixed annuity products more attractive in the marketplace compared to competing products such as bank deposits. Negative net flows for this product line in both of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 reflected the challenges of the sustained low interest rate environment, as consumers were reluctant to purchase these products at the relatively low crediting rates offered, which have been priced to maintain our targeted spreads. Fixed Annuities net flows also reflected slightly     123      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  higher surrender rates in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily on in-force business that had reached the end of the surrender charge period.  Retirement Income Solutions premiums and deposits and net flows increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting higher variable annuity sales, which have benefitted from innovative product enhancements and expanded distribution as well as a more favorable competitive environment.  Retail Mutual Fund deposits and net flows increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven primarily by sales of our Focused Dividend Strategy product offerings.    Institutional  Group Retirement net flows, which include net flows from mutual funds sold in group retirement markets, decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher surrenders of individual participant contracts as well as higher large group surrenders, partially offset by higher premiums and deposits. Net flows for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher individual and large group surrenders.  The following table presents reserves for selected product lines by surrender charge category at September 30, 2013 and 2012, and surrender rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012:                                          2013      2012       At September 30,    (in millions)       Group Retirement Products(a)       Individual Fixed Annuities       Retirement Income Solutions      Group Retirement Products(a)      Individual Fixed Annuities      Retirement Income Solutions            No surrender charge(b)         $   58,884           $   29,380           $   1,714     $ 55,906   $ 25,052   $ 1,935      0% – 2%            1,665             2,474             16,580       1,285     4,008     15,094      Greater than 2% – 4%           1,534             3,825              2,297       1,296     4,054     2,299      Greater than 4%            5,897             18,591             16,630       4,779     23,715     9,755      Non-surrenderable           330             3,037              213       711     3,062     1,340          Total reserves       $   68,310         $   57,307         $   37,434     $ 63,977   $ 59,891   $ 30,423          Surrender rates           9.3    %           6.5    %           9.0    %    8.1 %   6.1 %   10.3 %            (a) Excludes mutual fund assets under management of $13.8 billion and $11.3 billion at September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

AIG Life and Retirement Investments and Spread Management       Investments  We invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, we seek to enhance our returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, hedge funds, affordable housing partnerships, and to a lesser extent, common and preferred stocks. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic volatility, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields.  Our fundamental investment strategy is to maintain primarily a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to match established duration targets based on the characteristics of our liabilities. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. See Investments for additional discussion of our asset liability management process.     124                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT    NAIC Designations  The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called 'NAIC Designations.' In general, NAIC Designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of our fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments — Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings.  The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of AIG Life and Retirement categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:                              September 30, 2013 (in millions)      NAIC Designation      Other Fixed Maturity Securities      Mortgage Backed, Asset Backed and Collateralized      Total*               Investment grade:                                  1      $ 46,945     $ 36,639      $ 83,584            2        61,321        1,573        62,894                Subtotal investment grade        108,266        38,212        146,478             Below investment grade:                                  3        4,007        958        4,965            4        1,952        591        2,543            5        418        399        817            6        111        1,193        1,304                Subtotal below investment grade        6,488        3,141        9,629            Total         $ 114,754      $ 41,353     $ 156,107            * Excludes $483 million of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within AIG Life and Retirement that require a statutory filing.

During prolonged periods of low or declining interest rates, we generally must invest new net flows and reinvest the cash flows from investment sales, interest and principal payments of our portfolio in lower yielding securities.  Opportunistic investments in structured securities, private placement corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans continue to be made to improve yields, increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment.  We maintain investment portfolios for each product line which, to the extent practicable, match established duration targets based on the characteristics of our liabilities. We allocate net investment income from assets that support liabilities to the product line they support. Net investment income from investments in excess of liabilities, which include the majority of our alternative investments, is allocated to the product lines using a capital-based internal allocation model.  Net investment income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting a $30 million decrease in base net investment income (excluding alternative investments and other enhancements) due to the reinvestment of maturing investments and asset sale proceeds in the low interest rate environment, $33 million lower income from alternative investments, $38 million lower call and tender income, and a $32 million decrease in accretion of discount for certain highly rated structured securities, which was driven by recent increases in market interest rates. These decreases were partially offset by $14 million in fair value gains on our investment in PICC Group.  Net investment income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 decreased slightly compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to fair value gains of $246 million recognized in the same period of 2012 on our investment in ML II, which was liquidated in March 2012, when we received a distribution of $1.6 billion from the sale by the FRBNY of the securities held in ML II. Base net investment income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 decreased by $130 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to reinvestment of maturing investments and asset sale proceeds in the low interest rate environment. The decrease in net investment income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year also reflected net fair value losses of $38 million from our investment in PICC Group and a $41 million decrease in accretion of discount for certain highly rated structured securities, which was driven by recent increases in market interest rates. These decreases were largely offset by a $440 million increase in alternative investment income, including higher private equity and hedge fund income due to favorable equity market conditions and several large redemptions from hedge funds, and an increase in call and tender income of $35 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.     Spread Management  The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in our products may have the effect, in a continued low interest rate environment, of reducing our spreads and thus reducing future profitability. Although we partially mitigate this interest rate risk through our asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.  Disciplined pricing on new business resulted in lower new fixed annuity deposits in the first six months of 2013 relative to the same period in the prior year, due to the relatively low crediting rates offered; however, deposits improved in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the recent modest increase in market interest rates. In the current interest rate environment, we continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads. We have a dynamic product management process designed to ensure that new business product offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that we cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are     126      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, current products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower rates as permitted under state insurance product regulations.  •New sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent. •Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and zero to 2 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted net investment spreads. We are in the process of lowering the minimum guaranteed interest rates on new products, and expect this process to be substantially completed in 2014.  Active management of renewal crediting rates is done under contractual provisions in our annuity and universal life products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We have adjusted, and will continue to adjust, crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in-force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees. In addition to annuity and universal life products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment. See AIG Life and Retirement Reserves and DAC/VOBA — Other Reserve Changes for additional discussion of loss recognition.  The three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 included $110 million of additional interest credited expense resulting from a comprehensive review of reserves for the GIC portfolio.  As indicated in the table below, approximately 75 percent of our annuity and universal life account values were at their minimum crediting rates as of September 30, 2013, an increase from 61 percent at December 31, 2012. These products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of September 30, 2013 ranging from 1 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products.  The following table presents our universal life and fixed annuity account values by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates:                               September 30, 2013      Current Crediting Rates        Contractual Minimum Guaranteed Interest Rate   (in millions)      At Contractual Minimum Guarantee      1-50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee      More than 50 Basis Points Above Minimum Guarantee      Total            Universal life insurance                              1%   $ 44   $  –   $ 11   $ 55      > 1% – 2%     27     57     220     304      > 2% – 3%     448     261     1,288     1,997      > 3% – 4%     2,097     323     1,385     3,805      > 4% – 5%     4,241     189      –     4,430      > 5% – 5.5%     316      –      –     316          Subtotal   $ 7,173   $ 830   $ 2,904   $ 10,907          Fixed annuities*                              1%   $ 3,576   $ 4,212   $ 6,284   $ 14,072      > 1% – 2%     13,488     3,070     5,593     22,151      > 2% – 3%     32,818     250     3,462     36,530      > 3% – 4%     13,842     100     74     14,016      > 4% – 5%     8,148      –     5     8,153      > 5% – 5.5%     236      –     5     241          Subtotal   $ 72,108   $ 7,632   $ 15,423   $ 95,163          Total   $ 79,281   $ 8,462   $ 18,327   $ 106,070          Percentage of total     75 %   8 %   17 %   100 %            * Fixed annuities include fixed options within variable annuities sold in Group Retirement markets.      127      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT    Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)  Net realized capital gains were $398 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to $670 million in the same period in the prior year, due to lower gains from investment sales activity in connection with utilizing capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by fair value gains on embedded derivatives, net of hedges, which had net gains of $19 million compared to net losses of $279 million in the same period of the prior year. The embedded derivative gains, net of hedges, were primarily related to variable annuities with guarantee features, and the change in fair value gains in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to increases in long-term interest rates.  Net realized capital gains were $2.0 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to $530 million in the same period in the prior year. The improvement compared to the same period in the prior year was due to higher gains from sales activity in connection with utilizing capital loss carryforwards, lower other-than-temporary impairments, and fair value gains on embedded derivatives, net of hedges, which had net gains of $150 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to net losses of $751 million in the same period of the prior year.    Changes in Fair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities Designated to Hedge Living Benefits Liabilities  Changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities, which are excluded from Pre-tax operating income, reflect AIG Life and Retirement's dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatilities related to embedded derivative liabilities contained in guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities. We substantially hedge our exposure to equity markets. Due to regulatory capital considerations, however, a portion of our interest rate exposure is unhedged. In the first quarter of 2012, we began purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds as a capital-efficient strategy to reduce our interest rate risk exposure over time. As a result of subsequent increases in interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds, the fair value of the U.S. Treasury bonds used for hedging, net of financing costs, decreased by $30 million and $128 million in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to a decrease of $3 million and an increase of $48 million, respectively, in the same periods of the prior year.     128      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT      AIG Life and Retirement Reserves and DAC/VOBA     The following table presents AIG Life and Retirement insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management:                                                        Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,        (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            Retail                                       Balance at beginning of period, gross       $   128,027     $ 122,266       $   123,699     $ 120,396      Premiums and deposits           6,133       2,819           14,285       9,511      Surrenders and withdrawals           (2,248    )    (2,116 )         (7,316    )    (6,732 )    Death, and other contract benefits            (853    )    (875 )          (2,627    )    (2,714 )          Subtotal           3,032       (172 )          4,342       65      Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees           1,355       1,316           2,998       2,358      Cost of funds           546       604           1,678       1,825      Other reserve changes           (301    )    (269 )         (58    )    (899 )          Balance at end of period           132,659       123,745            132,659       123,745      Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments           9       442           9       442      Reinsurance ceded           (1,493    )    (1,497 )         (1,493    )    (1,497 )          Total insurance reserves and retail mutual funds assets under management       $   131,175     $ 122,690       $   131,175     $ 122,690          Institutional                                        Balance at beginning of period, gross         $   113,857     $ 106,543         $   110,494     $ 103,315      Premiums and deposits           2,289       1,966           6,482       6,268      Surrenders and withdrawals           (2,980    )    (1,516 )         (8,078    )    (5,439 )    Death, and other contract benefits            (525    )    (481 )          (1,498    )    (1,464 )          Subtotal           (1,216    )    (31 )         (3,094    )    (635 )    Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees           2,903       2,125           6,518       4,899      Cost of funds           396       545           1,174       1,358      Other reserve changes           159       364           1,007       609          Balance at end of period           116,099       109,546            116,099       109,546      Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments           –       2,364           –       2,364      Reinsurance ceded           (211    )    (236 )         (211    )    (236 )          Total insurance reserves and group mutual fund assets under management         $   115,888     $ 111,674         $   115,888     $ 111,674          Total AIG Life and Retirement:                                       Balance at beginning of period, gross       $   241,884     $ 228,809       $   234,193     $ 223,711      Premiums and deposits           8,422       4,785           20,767       15,779      Surrenders and withdrawals           (5,228    )    (3,632 )         (15,394    )    (12,171 )    Death, and other contract benefits            (1,378    )    (1,356 )          (4,125    )    (4,178 )          Subtotal           1,816       (203 )          1,248       (570 )    Change in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees           4,258       3,441           9,516       7,257      Cost of funds           942       1,149           2,852       3,183      Other reserve changes           (142    )    95           949       (290 )          Balance at end of period           248,758       233,291            248,758       233,291      Reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments           9       2,806           9       2,806      Reinsurance ceded           (1,704    )    (1,733 )         (1,704    )    (1,733 )          Total insurance reserves and mutual fund assets under management       $   247,063     $ 234,364       $   247,063     $ 234,364              129      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT    Other Reserve Changes  Other reserve changes in the table above include loss recognition on certain long-term payout annuity contracts. In connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards, we sold investment securities in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012. These and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered recording of loss recognition reserves of $244 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, and $598 million in the same period in 2012, on certain long-term payout annuity contracts. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, loss recognition totaled $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Additional sales of such investment securities are contemplated in the remainder of 2013, which could result in additional loss recognition. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves.  Loss recognition is excluded from Pre-tax operating income and reported within Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) in the AIG Life and Retirement Results table herein.    DAC/VOBA and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments  The change in DAC/VOBA and reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments increased in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the change in the same periods of the prior year, as a result of the decrease in unrealized appreciation of investments driven by recent increases in market interest rates.      DAC/VOBA Rollforward     The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in AIG Life and Retirement DAC/VOBA:                                      Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions)       2013      2012            Balance, beginning of year         $   5,672     $ 6,502          Acquisition costs deferred           665       548      Amortization expense           (489    )    (746 )    Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments           661       (616 )          Balance, end of period*         $   6,509     $ 5,688            * DAC/VOBA balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion at September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.     Estimated Gross Profits for Interest-Sensitive Products  Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, interest-sensitive products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.  In the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, we completed our comprehensive annual review and update of estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for our interest-sensitive products. The result of this review was a $118 million net increase in pre-tax operating income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, which included a $198 million net increase in our Retail operating segment and an $80 million decrease in our Institutional operating segment. The net increase in Retail pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a favorable adjustment in our Fixed Annuities product line from updated spread assumptions due to active management of crediting rates and higher future investment yields than those previously assumed. In the Life Insurance and A&H, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines, the update of     130      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / AIG LIFE AND RETIREMENT  assumptions for variable annuity spreads, surrender rates, and life insurance mortality had an unfavorable impact on pre-tax operating income. The life insurance mortality assumptions, while unfavorable compared to the previous assumption set, are still within pricing expectations.  The $118 million increase in pre-tax operating income to reflect updated assumptions was comprised of a $98 million net decrease in DAC amortization expense, a $61 million decrease in SIA amortization expense within Interest credited to policyholder account balances, and a $28 million decrease in unearned revenue amortization within Policy fees, partially offset by a $69 million increase in Future policy benefits for life and health insurance contracts. The net adjustment to DAC amortization represented less than 2 percent of the DAC/VOBA balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of September 30, 2013.  The effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets on the estimated gross profits of products with guaranteed benefit features is mitigated in part through the use of a "reversion to the mean" methodology, which allows us to maintain our long-term assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of short-term deviations from these assumptions occurring in the current period. If favorable equity market performance continues for the remainder of 2013, an update of estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items for certain of our Group Retirement products could result in a favorable adjustment to pre-tax operating income.      OTHER OPERATIONS     AIG's Other Operations include results from Mortgage Guaranty, GCM, DIB, Retained Interests and Corporate & Other (after allocations to AIG's business segments) as presented below.    Mortgage Guaranty (United Guaranty Corporation or UGC) offers private residential mortgage guaranty insurance, which protects mortgage lenders and investors from loss due to borrower default and loan foreclosure. The coverage we provide — which is called mortgage guaranty insurance, mortgage insurance, or simply "MI" — enables borrowers to purchase a house with a modest down payment by protecting lenders against the increased risk of borrower default related to high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages — those with less than 20 percent equity.    Global Capital Markets consists of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. The AIGFP portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, it consists predominantly of transactions that AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, or are currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis.    Direct Investment Book consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by AIG Parent in the MIP and certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP. The management of the DIB portfolio is focused on an orderly wind down to maximize returns consistent with AIG's risk management objectives. Certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of the DIB are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility.    Retained Interests includes the fair value gains or losses, prior to their sale in 2012, of the AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering and the fair value gains or losses, prior to the FRBNY liquidation of ML III assets in 2012, on the retained interest in ML III.     131                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / OTHER OPERATIONS    Corporate & Other consists primarily of interest expense, consolidation and eliminations, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific reportable segments, certain expenses related to internal controls and the financial and operating platforms, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, the results of AIG's real estate investment operations and net loss and gain on sale of divested businesses and properties that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting treatment.

Net premiums earned increased, reflecting a $37 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned due to growth of the book of business, partially offset by premium declines in the second-lien, and international businesses, both of which were placed in run-off during 2008. Additionally, the decline in claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred reflected a $50 million decrease in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses partially offset by a $23 million increase in second-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses. The decline in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses is the result of an 18 percent decline in newly reported delinquencies and improving cure rates, partially offset by unfavorable prior year reserve development during the third quarter of 2013 compared to favorable development in the same period of 2012. The increase in second-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses reflected lower favorable development and an increase in the overturn of previously denied claims in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period of 2012. These increases to pre-tax operating income were partially offset by an increase in underwriting expenses due to the increased expenses related to higher volumes of new business.  New insurance written, which represents the original principal balance of the insured mortgages, increased due to the market acceptance of UGC's risk-based pricing model by an increasing number of lenders as well as the addition and expansion of distribution channels. See Outlook — Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty for further discussion.    Mortgage Guaranty Year-to-Date Results  Pre-tax operating income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 increased compared to the same period in 2012. Net premiums earned increased, due primarily to a $100 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned, partially offset by declines in second-lien, student loan and international businesses, all of which were placed     134      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / OTHER OPERATIONS  into run-off during 2008. Additionally, the decline in claims and claims adjustment expenses reflected decreases in first-lien, student loan and international claims and claims adjustment expenses of $35 million, $17 million and $10 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $14 million increase in second-lien claims and claims adjustment expense. The decline in first-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred was primarily the result of reduced newly reported delinquencies and increasing cure rates. The decline in student loan claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred reflect recoveries on prior paid losses. The decline in international claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred reflect improved loss experience during the year and the de-risking of the international business through commutations. Second-lien claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred increased primarily reflecting increased overturns of previously denied claims.  New insurance written increased during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to the market acceptance of UGC's risk-based pricing model discussed above.    Global Capital Markets Operations       Global Capital Markets Quarterly Results  GCM pre-tax income and pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to a decline in unrealized market valuation gains related to the super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio.  Unrealized market valuation gains of $54 million and $204 million were recognized in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decline resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) driven by price movements and amortization within the CDS portfolio.    Global Capital Markets Year-to-Date Results  GCM's pre-tax income and pre-tax operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to an improvement in net credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decline in unrealized market valuation gains related to the CDS portfolio.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $153 million were recognized in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to net credit valuation losses of $76 million for the same period in 2012. The improvement resulted primarily from lower losses on derivative liabilities due to less significant tightening of AIG's credit spreads in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and higher gains on derivative assets due to more significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.  Unrealized market valuation gains of $356 million and $401 million were recognized in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decline resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by amortization, terminations and maturities within the CDS portfolio.

Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $39 million and $323 million were recognized for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the portfolio size due to sales and maturities as well as lower gains on assets due to less significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by lower losses on liabilities due to less significant tightening of AIG's credit spreads in the three-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.    Direct Investment Book Year-to-Date Results  DIB pre-tax income decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to a one time realized capital gain recorded in 2012 on the sale of common units of The Blackstone Group L.P., partially offset by improvements in pre-tax operating income and unrealized gains on interest rate swap hedge positions in 2013. DIB pre-tax operating income increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by a decline in net credit valuation adjustments on assets and liabilities for which the fair value option was elected and a decline in gains realized upon unwinding certain positions.  Fair value appreciation on ABS CDOs was $670 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 driven primarily by improved collateral pricing due to improvements in home price indices and amortization of the underlying collateral.  Net credit valuation adjustment gains of $332 million and $453 million were recognized for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the portfolio size due to sales and maturities as well as lower gains on assets due to less significant tightening of counterparty credit spreads, partially offset by lower losses on liabilities due to less significant tightening of AIG's credit spreads in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.  The change in Net realized capital gains for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was driven by a $426 million gain on the sale of 35.7 million common units of The Blackstone Group L.P. in the first quarter of 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on interest rate swap hedge positions in 2013 as a result of interest rate increases.

On September 11, 2012, AIG sold approximately 600 million ordinary shares of AIA for a loss of $19 million. The fair value of AIG's then remaining interest in AIA securities increased $527 million and $1.8 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively.    Change in Fair Value of ML III Prior to Liquidation  The gains attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were based in part on the completion of the final auction of ML III assets by the FRBNY, in the third quarter of 2012.    Corporate & Other       Quarterly and Year-to-Date Corporate & Other Results  Corporate & Other reported an increase in operating losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs due to performance relative to incentive targets in 2013. In addition, Corporate expenses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 included reductions in expenses of $117 million and $184 million, respectively, from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the Department of the Treasury's underwriting fees in connection with the sales of AIG Common Stock.    Legal Reserves     Legal reserves relate to increased estimated litigation liability based on developments in several actions.    Loss on Extinguishment of Debt     The increase in loss on extinguishment of debt in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 resulted from redemptions and repurchases of, and cash tender offers for, certain debt securities in 2013.    Net Loss on Sale of Divested Businesses     On May 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to sell certain non-core insurance subsidiaries, which we expect, subject to customary closing conditions, will close before the end of the year. We recognized a pre-tax loss in connection with this sale of approximately $47 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.     137                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS / DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS     Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations is comprised of the following:                                    Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,        (in millions)       2013      2012       2013      2012            ILFC       $   581     $ 37       $   1,815     $ 237      Net gain (loss) on sale            (609    )    –           (1,636    )    12          Income from discontinued operations           (28    )    37           179       249      Income tax expense (benefit)           14       –           95       (31 )          Income from discontinued operations, net of tax       $   (42    )  $ 37       $   84     $ 280           Significant items affecting the comparison of results from discontinued operations in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 included pre-tax income of $581 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, largely offset by a pre-tax loss on the sale of ILFC of $582 million and $1.8 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, both reflecting the absence of depreciation and amortization expense because ILFC is classified as held for sale, and a pre-tax loss of $27 million and pre-tax gain of $118 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, in connection with the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) primarily attributable to the refund of taxes, interest and penalties, together with other matters.  See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations.     138                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Liquidity and Capital Resources      Overview     Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Risk Appetite, Identification, and Measurement in the 2012 Annual Report and Enterprise Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.  Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We and our insurance subsidiaries must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM's stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.  Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs, loss of some sources of liquidity or capital, or both. In addition, regulatory, and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.  Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders, share purchases and acquisitions.     139      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013   Sources  •AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries  During the first nine months of 2013, we collected $1.5 billion in cash dividends from AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries and approximately $3.1 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries.  •Legal Settlement  On August 26, 2013, we agreed to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement with Brookfield Asset Management, Inc. and Brysons International, Ltd, in exchange for a payment to AIGFP of $905 million.  •Debt Issuances  On August 9, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2020.* •ALICO Escrow Release  On May 1, 2013, $547 million held in escrow to secure indemnifications provided to MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) under the ALICO stock purchase agreement was released to AIG.   Uses  •Debt Reduction  During the first nine months of 2013, we repaid approximately $7.6 billion of debt as follows:   We redeemed $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures and $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.45% Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures, in each case, for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.   We redeemed $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.650% senior notes due 2014 for a redemption price of 101.1 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.   We purchased, in cash tender offers, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.0 billion of our junior subordinated debentures, capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by AIG Life Holdings, Inc.

The following table presents a summary of AIG's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:                                      Nine Months Ended September 30,    (in millions)       2013      2012            Summary:                       Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities       $   3,948     $ 2,839      Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities           6,518       19,158      Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities            (9,472    )    (21,854 )    Effect of exchange rate changes on cash           (79    )    (9 )          Increase in cash           915       134      Cash at beginning of year           1,151       1,474      Change in cash of businesses held for sale            (8    )    –          Cash at end of period       $   2,058     $ 1,608             Operating Cash Flow Activities     Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.  Interest payments totaled $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $3.1 billion in the first nine months of 2012. Cash provided by operating activities excluding interest payments was $6.9 billion for the     141      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  first nine months of 2013 and $5.9 billion for the first nine months of 2012. Operating cash flow activities for the first nine months of 2013 include:  •$0.1 billion used by AIG Property Casualty compared to cash provided of $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2012, primarily reflecting the timing of the payments related to catastrophe losses;  •$2.1 billion provided by AIG Life and Retirement compared to cash provided of $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2012, primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income; and  •$2.0 billion provided by discontinued operations compared to cash provided of $2.3 billion for the first nine months of 2012.    Investing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 includes approximately $1.1 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement.  Net cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of 2012 includes:  •approximately $1.0 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by AIG Life and Retirement;  •approximately $1.6 billion of distributions from AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries related to the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II;  •approximately $8.0 billion of gross proceeds from the sale of approximately 2.3 billion AIA ordinary shares; and   •approximately $8.5 billion of payments received in connection with the dispositions of ML III assets by the FRBNY.    Financing Cash Flow Activities     Net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2013 includes:  •approximately $147 million to pay a dividend of $0.10 per share on AIG Common Stock;   •approximately $192 million to purchase approximately 4 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and   •approximately $7.4 billion to repay long term debt; see Debt — Debt Maturities below.  Net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2012 includes:  •$8.6 billion to pay down the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV preferred interests; and   •approximately $13.0 billion to purchase approximately 421 million shares of AIG Common Stock.      Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries       AIG Parent     As of September 30, 2013, AIG Parent had approximately $16.9 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent's liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and tenor. During the first nine months of 2013, upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchased publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity sources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans, and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs.     142      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries to facilitate the transfer of capital and liquidity within AIG. We expect these CMAs to continue to enhance AIG's capital management practices, and help manage the flow of capital between AIG Parent and these subsidiaries. We have entered into CMAs with certain insurance subsidiaries in 2013. See AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement and Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty below for additional information. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:                      (In millions)       As of September 30, 2013            Cash and short-term investments(a)(b)       $   9,776        Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(c)           2,960              Total AIG Parent liquidity           12,736              Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(d)           3,627        Available capacity under contingent liquidity facility(e)           500              Total AIG Parent liquidity sources       $   16,863                (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $7.9 billion as of September 30, 2013.  (b) $5.9 billion of cash and short-term investments are allocated toward future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs of DIB and GCM as of September 30, 2013.  (c) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds.

Uses  •Debt Reduction During the first nine months of 2013, we:    •redeemed $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7.70% Series A-5 Junior Subordinated Debentures and $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.45% Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures, in each case for a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest; and   •redeemed $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.650% senior notes due 2014 for a redemption price of 101.1 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.     We purchased, during the first nine months of 2013, in cash tender offers:    •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1 billion, approximately 77 million British pounds aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures, approximately 182 million Euro aggregate principal amount of our 8.000% Series A-7 Junior Subordinated Debentures, approximately $79 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and approximately $366 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.175% Series A-6 Junior Subordinated Debentures;   •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $211 million, approximately $19 million liquidation amount of 81/2% Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities, approximately $114 million liquidation amount of 7.57% Capital Securities, Series A and approximately $29 million liquidation amount of 81/8% Capital Securities, Series B, all of which were issued by statutory trusts controlled by AIGLH; and   •for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $61 million, approximately $62 million aggregate principal amount of 5.60% Senior Debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by SunAmerica Inc.     During the first nine months of 2013, we also repaid $2.6 billion of debt, including $883 million of MIP long-term debt, and made interest payments totaling $1.5 billion.    •Purchase of Warrants  We paid approximately $25 million in the first quarter 2013 in the aggregate to purchase a warrant issued to the Department of the Treasury in 2008 that provided the right to purchase approximately 2.7 million shares of AIG Common Stock at $50.00 per share and a warrant issued to the Department of the Treasury in 2009 that provided the right to purchase up to 150 shares of AIG Common Stock at $0.00002 per share.  •Dividend  We paid a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on AIG Common Stock in the third quarter of 2013.  •Repurchase of Common Stock We repurchased approximately 4 million shares of AIG Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $192 million in the third quarter of 2013.       144      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    AIG Property Casualty     We expect that AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries' liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  AIG Property Casualty paid cash dividends to AIG Parent of $716 million and $1.5 billion in the three- and nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, respectively.  AIG Parent could be required to provide additional funding to AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances, including:  •large catastrophes that may require AIG to provide additional support to our affected operations;   •downgrades in AIG's credit ratings that could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of AIG's subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations;   •increases in market interest rates that may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital; and  •other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain, including economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.  AIG Parent, AIG Property Casualty Inc. and certain AIG Property Casualty domestic insurance subsidiaries are parties to a consolidated CMA. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of these AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries, measured as a group (the Fleet), at or above the specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's projected total authorized control level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). In addition, the CMA provides that if the total adjusted capital of the Fleet exceeds that same specified minimum percentage of the Fleet's total authorized control level RBC, subject to approval by their respective boards, and compliance with applicable insurance laws, the AIG Property Casualty insurance subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce the Fleet's projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage. As of September 30, 2013, the specified minimum percentage was 325 percent.  For the first nine months of 2013, cash dividends of approximately $1.0 billion were paid pursuant to the CMA and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions pursuant to the CMA.  On May 17, 2013, Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington) purchased stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Boston, thereby becoming a member of the FHLB of Boston. Additionally, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (NUFI) is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh and Chartis Specialty Insurance Company (CSI) is a member of the FHLB of Chicago. FHLB membership provides participants with access to various services, including access to low-cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage-backed securities, government and agency securities and other qualifying assets. These advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes. As of September 30, 2013, there were no FHLB advances outstanding for NUFI, CSI or Lexington.  On April 29, 2013, we entered into a new $625 million Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) letter of credit facility, which replaced the prior $725 million ACNL letter of credit facility. Under the new facility, AIG Parent replaced AIG Property Casualty Inc. as a direct obligor. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd's), is required to hold capital at Lloyd's, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, which supports the 2013, 2014 and 2015 years of account, the entire FAL requirement of $564 million, as of April 29, 2013, was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility.     145      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     AIG Life and Retirement     We expect that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries' liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  In the first nine months of 2013, AIG Life and Retirement provided $3.1 billion of liquidity to AIG Parent, which was funded by the payment of dividends and loan repayments from AIG Life and Retirement's insurance subsidiaries.  The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a significant potential liquidity requirement for AIG Life and Retirement's insurance subsidiaries. We believe that because of the size and liquidity of our investment portfolios, AIG Life and Retirement does not face a significant liquidity risk due to normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience. Furthermore, AIG Life and Retirement's products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of its risk management framework, AIG Life and Retirement continues to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve its liquidity position and facilitate AIG Life and Retirement's ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. AIG Life and Retirement also has developed a robust contingent liquidity plan to address any unforeseen liquidity needs.  AIG Life and Retirement executes programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from its investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to liquid investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that an AIG Life and Retirement insurance company may lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account admitted assets. AIG Life and Retirement's liability to the borrower for collateral received was $4.1 billion as of September 30, 2013. In addition, certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. As of September 30, 2013, AIG Life and Retirement had outstanding borrowings of $50 million from the FHLBs. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other general corporate purposes.  AIG Parent is party to CMAs with certain AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries. Among other things, the CMAs provide that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary's projected company action level RBC. In addition, the CMAs provide that if the total adjusted capital of these AIG Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level RBC, subject to approval by their respective boards and compliance with applicable insurance laws, the subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage. As of September 30, 2013, the specified minimum percentage was 385 percent, except for the CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company, where the specified minimum percentage is 250 percent.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, approximately $3.1 billion was distributed under the CMAs and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the CMAs.    Other Operations         Mortgage Guaranty     We expect that Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Mortgage Guaranty's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated, fixed maturity securities. These securities could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations.  Mortgage Guaranty paid no dividends to AIG Parent in the first nine months of 2013.     146      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  On July 1, 2013, AIG Parent entered into a CMA with a Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance subsidiary would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of September 30, 2013, the minimum required capital is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 21 to 1.  For the third quarter of 2013, no dividends were paid pursuant to the CMA, and AIG Parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the CMA.      Global Capital Markets     Derivative transactions between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through GCM. One of GCM's entities generally acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for AIG entities. Commencing June 10, 2013, GCM was required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). To the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation, GCM is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and GCM's clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants. To the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation, these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements, the form of which is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA). These agreements, primarily between GCM and third party financial institutions, require collateral postings. Many of GCM's transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements, the purpose of which are to provide collateral to GCM, which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties, including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants.  In addition, most of GCM's CDSs are subject to collateral posting provisions. The collateral posting provisions contained in the ISDA Master Agreements and related transaction documents with respect to CDSs differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior CDSs is a function of our credit ratings, the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with the latter being the most significant factor. We estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDSs using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions.  As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, GCM had total assets of $8.0 billion in both periods and total liabilities of $3.4 billion and $4.9 billion. GCM's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, other receivables, net of allowance, and unrealized gains on swaps, options and forwards. GCM's liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted by GCM to third parties was $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. GCM obtained collateral from third parties totaling $604 million and $846 million at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. The collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under ISDA Master Agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date.      Direct Investment Book     The DIB portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities, as they come due, even under stress scenarios, and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives. If the DIB's risk target is breached, we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB's liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.     147      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The DIB's assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, U.S. government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities. The DIB's liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short-term financing obligations. As of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, the DIB had total assets of $23.7 billion and $28.5 billion and total liabilities of $20.8 billion and $23.8 billion.  The overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the DIB is executed by GCM. The value of hedges related to the non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP in the DIB is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of GCM and is not included within the DIB operating results, assets or liabilities.  Collateral posted by operations included in the DIB to third parties was $4.3 billion at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.      Credit Facilities     We maintain a committed revolving four-year syndicated credit facility (the Four-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Four-Year Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit. We currently expect to replace or extend the Four-Year Facility on or prior to its expiration in October 2016, although no assurance can be given that the Four-Year Facility will be replaced on favorable terms or at all.  The Four-Year Facility provides for $4.0 billion of unsecured revolving loans, which includes a $2.0 billion letter of credit sublimit. As of September 30, 2013, a total of approximately $3.6 billion remains available under the Four-Year Facility, of which approximately $1.6 billion remains available for letters of credit. During the third quarter of 2013, we reduced our utilization of letters of credit under the Four-Year Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Four-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Four-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Four-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Four-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.      Contingent Liquidity Facilities     AIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.  Our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.     148      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Contractual Obligations     The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:                                              Payments due by Period       September 30, 2013    (in millions)      Total Payments      Remainder of 2013      2014 – 2015      2016 – 2017      2018      Thereafter               Insurance operations                                            Loss reserves     $ 86,458      $ 22,344     $ 24,743     $ 12,774      $ 4,152     $ 22,445        Insurance and investment contract liabilities        229,502        4,024        27,878        26,726        12,240        158,634        Borrowings        1,651        –        51        7        3        1,590        Interest payments on borrowings        2,734        13        220        220        110        2,171        Other long-term obligations        31        6        12        8        4        1            Total     $ 320,376     $ 26,387      $ 52,904     $ 39,735      $ 16,509     $ 184,841             Other                                            Borrowings(a)      $ 60,950     $ 1,622     $ 11,192      $ 15,752     $ 9,959      $ 22,425        Interest payments on borrowings        37,136        903        6,477        5,134        1,787        22,835        Aircraft purchase commitments        21,808        376        4,899        7,646        4,367        4,520        Other long-term obligations        207        1        89        3        –        114            Total     $ 120,101     $ 2,902      $ 22,657     $ 28,535      $ 16,113     $ 49,894             Consolidated                                            Loss reserves     $ 86,458      $ 22,344     $ 24,743      $ 12,774     $ 4,152     $ 22,445        Insurance and investment contract liabilities        229,502        4,024        27,878        26,726        12,240        158,634        Borrowings(a)        62,601        1,622        11,243        15,759        9,962        24,015        Interest payments on borrowings        39,870        916        6,697        5,354        1,897        25,006        Aircraft purchase commitments        21,808        376        4,899        7,646        4,367        4,520        Other long-term obligations(b)        238        7        101        11        4        115            Total(c)     $ 440,477     $ 29,289      $ 75,561     $ 68,270      $ 32,622     $ 234,735            (a) Includes $22.3 billion of borrowings related to ILFC which is reported as discontinued operations.  (b) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.  (c) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.6 billion ($4.3 billion excluding ILFC), the timing of which is uncertain.       Loss Reserves     Loss reserves relate to the AIG Property Casualty and the Mortgage Guaranty businesses, and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that AIG Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.     149                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities     Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to AIG Life and Retirement businesses. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of our control.  We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We believe that AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, AIG Life and Retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.      Borrowings     Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements.     150      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments     The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:                                              Amount of Commitment Expiring       September 30, 2013  (in millions)      Total Amounts Committed     Remainder of 2013      2014- 2015      2016- 2017      2018      Thereafter               Insurance operations                                            Guarantees:                                            Standby letters of credit     $ 932     $ 134     $ 157     $ 564     $ 77     $  –        Guarantees of indebtedness       176        –        –        –        –       176        All other guarantees(a)       8        –        –       1        –       7        Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(b)       2,032       1,514       359       159        –        –        Commitments to extend credit       1,197       1,025       172        –        –        –        Letters of credit       9        –       9        –        –        –        Other commercial commitments       644        –        –        –        –       644            Total(c)     $ 4,998     $ 2,673     $ 697     $ 724     $ 77     $ 827             Other                                            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(d)     $ 101     $  –     $  –     $  –     $  –     $ 101        Standby letters of credit       307       299       6       2        –        –        All other guarantees(a)       199        –       40       32       31       96        Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(b)       445       253       125        –       25       42        Commitments to extend credit       540       538       2        –        –        –        Letters of credit       20       5       15        –        –        –        Other commercial commitments(e)       36       34       2        –        –        –            Total(c)(f)     $ 1,648     $ 1,129     $ 190     $ 34     $ 56     $ 239             Consolidated                                            Guarantees:                                            Liquidity facilities(d)     $ 101     $  –     $  –     $  –     $  –     $ 101        Standby letters of credit       1,239       433       163       566       77        –        Guarantees of indebtedness       176        –        –        –        –       176        All other guarantees(a)       207        –       40       33       31       103        Commitments:                                            Investment commitments(b)       2,477       1,767       484       159       25       42        Commitments to extend credit       1,737       1,563       174        –        –        –        Letters of credit       29       5       24        –        –        –        Other commercial commitments(e)       680       34       2        –        –       644            Total(c)(f)     $ 6,646     $ 3,802     $ 887     $ 758     $ 133     $ 1,066           (a) Includes residual value guarantees associated with aircraft and AIG Life and Retirement construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments. Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations.  (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.  (c) Does not include guarantees, capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.  (e) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining pension contribution for 2013 is expected to be approximately $18 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans  (f) Includes $335 million attributable to ILFC, which is reported as discontinued operations.     151      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities     Although we enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, our involvement with VIEs is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturity securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. We consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    Indemnification Agreements     We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.  We are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers". Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or require accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.  In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions, or could experience termination of the transactions. Such transactions could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be required to post additional collateral, and certain additional AIGFP counterparties would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.  The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depend on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Liquidity, Capital and Credit in the 2012 Annual Report.      Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock     On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.10 per share, which was paid on September 26, 2013 to shareholders of record on September 12, 2013.  On October 31, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.10 per share, payable on December 19, 2013 to shareholders of record on December 5, 2013. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  On August 1, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.0 billion, from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. The timing of such repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. As of September 30, 2013, we have repurchased approximately four million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $192 million pursuant to this authorization.  Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for additional discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by AIG's subsidiaries.     155                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS      Investments      Overview     Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for AIG Property Casualty, AIG Life and Retirement, and AIG Parent including the DIB. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.       Investments Highlights During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013    •An increase in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities, particularly during the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by narrowing spreads of high yield securities, resulted in net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available-for-sale portfolio declined to approximately $13 billion as of September 30, 2013 from approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2012.  •We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.  •Net investment income benefited from higher returns on alternative investments primarily due to the performance of equity markets.  •Blended investment yields on new AIG Life and Retirement and AIG Property Casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  •Other-than-temporary-impairments remained at low levels, with a small portion of impairments attributable to structured securities.       Investment Strategies     At the local operating unit level, investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market, general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.   •In the case of AIG Life and Retirement, as well as in the DIB, our fundamental investment strategy is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable.  •Fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which provided attractive after-tax returns and limited credit risk. To meet the current risk-return and tax objectives of AIG Property Casualty, cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.  •Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  •AIG Parent's liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and tenor. During the first nine months of 2013, upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchased publicly traded, intermediate term, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.     156      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS      Credit Ratings     At September 30, 2013, approximately 89 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 18 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services' ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.  A significant portion of our foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody's, S&P or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio's non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2013, approximately 17 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 3 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 47 percent of the foreign entities' fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance     Composite AIG Credit Ratings  With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The "Non-rated" category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.  See Enterprise Risk Management herein for a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments.     157      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  The following table presents the composite

AIG Property Casualty     In our property casualty business, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines. As differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies, the focus is not on asset-liability matching, but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus.  Fixed maturity securities of AIG Property Casualty domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.1 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.     159                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  Fixed maturity securities held in AIG Property Casualty foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration, averaging 4.1 years.  While invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in AIG Property Casualty domestic operations, a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds. These investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long-term returns over time.    AIG Life and Retirement     With respect to AIG Life and Retirement, we use asset-liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets. Our objective is to maintain an average duration in our asset and liability structure, although we may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position. To the extent that we have maintained a matched asset-liability structure, the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated.  Our investment strategy for AIG Life and Retirement is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities. There exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in-force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.  AIG Life and Retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a low interest rate environment.  The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds from investment activity requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity.  A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products. The fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. We manage our exposure resulting from these long-term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. We actively review underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees. We have taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees. We execute listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products. We also enter into various types of futures and options contracts, primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates. We use several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure, including listed futures on government securities, listed options on government securities and the purchase of government securities.  With respect to over-the-counter derivatives, we deal with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. We have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. We generally use ISDA Master Agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.  Fixed maturity securities of AIG Life and Retirement, with an average duration of 6.7 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on our composite ratings.     160      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS      Available-for-Sale Investments     The following table presents the fair value of AIG's available-for-sale securities:                                       (in millions)       Fair Value at September 30, 2013      Fair Value at December 31, 2012            Bonds available for sale:                      U.S. government and government sponsored entities       $   3,435    $ 3,483      Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions          30,881      35,705      Non-U.S. governments          23,034      26,800      Corporate debt          144,168      151,112      Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:                      RMBS          36,476      34,392      CMBS          11,512      9,915      CDO/ABS          10,395      8,552          Total mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized          58,383      52,859          Total bonds available for sale*          259,901      269,959          Equity securities available for sale:                     Common stock          3,018      3,029      Preferred stock          77      78      Mutual funds          283      105          Total equity securities available for sale          3,378      3,212          Total       $   263,279    $ 273,171            * At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, bonds available for sale held by us that were below investment grade or not rated totaled $31.1 billion and $29.6 billion, respectively.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 related to:  •issuer-specific credit events;  •securities for which we have changed our intent from hold to sell;  •declines due to foreign exchange rates;  •adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities;  •securities that experienced severe market valuation declines; and  •other impairments, including equity securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, direct private equity investments, aircraft trusts and investments in life settlement contracts.     170                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / INVESTMENTS  There was no significant impact to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations from other-than-temporary impairment charges for any one single credit. Also, no individual other-than-temporary impairment charge exceeded 0.02 percent and 0.10 percent of total equity at September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $184 million and $215 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $611 million and $668 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(e) Item count is by CUSIP by subsidiary.     Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments     The increases in unrealized depreciation of investments in the first nine months of 2013 were primarily attributable to depreciation in bonds available for sale due to an increase in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities, particularly during the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by narrowing spreads of higher yielding securities.  The increases in unrealized appreciation of investments in the first nine months of 2012 were primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and significant spread tightening partially offset by higher U.S. Treasury rates.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $12.8 billion primarily due to the increase in interest rates for investment grade fixed maturity securities, which more than offset the narrowing of credit spreads for higher yielding securities and the realization of approximately $2.1 billion in gains from sales of securities.

We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.                 Overview      We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm's major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses.    For a further discussion of AIG's risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management in the 2012 Annual Report.     Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)    •    Our ERM framework provides senior management with a consolidated view of our risk appetite and major risk positions.   •    In each of our business units, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the ERM framework while working with ERM to mitigate risks across the firm.   •    Risk management is an integral part of how we manage our core businesses.         Credit Risk Management       Overview     Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of counterparty's credit ratings.  We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from fixed maturity investments, equity securities, deposits, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit accepted as collateral.  Our credit risks are managed at the corporate level within ERM. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by seasoned credit officers in all the business units, whose primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of credit risk policies and procedures.  Responsibilities of the CCO and credit executives include:  •developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies;  •approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives;  •managing the approval process for requests for credit limits, program limits and credit transactions above authorities or where concentrations of risk may exist or be incurred;     172      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT   •aggregating globally all credit exposure data by counterparty, country, sector and industry and reporting risk concentrations regularly to and reviewing with senior management;  •administering regular portfolio credit reviews of investment, derivative and credit-incurring business units and recommending corrective actions where required;  •conducting credit research on countries, sectors and asset classes where risk concentrations may exist;   •developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process; and  •approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies in all credit portfolios.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, such as cash, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We identify our aggregate credit exposures to our underlying counterparty risks.      Largest Credit Concentrations     Our single largest credit exposure, the U.S. Government, was 24 percent of Total equity at September 30, 2013 and 25 percent of Total equity at December 31, 2012. Exposure to the U.S. Government primarily includes credit exposure related to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and to direct and guaranteed exposures to U.S. government-sponsored entities, primarily the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) based upon their U.S. Government conservatorship. Based on our internal risk ratings, at September 30, 2013, our largest below investment grade-rated credit exposure, apart from ILFC leasing arrangements secured by aircraft with airlines having below investment grade ratings, was related to a non-financial corporate counterparty. That exposure was 0.6 percent of Total equity at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.      Government Credit Concentrations (non-U.S.)     Our total direct and guaranteed credit exposure to non-U.S. governments is $23.2 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $23.7 billion in December 31, 2012. Our single largest concentration in this sector was to the government of Japan in the amount of $6.6 billion at September 30, 2013. Most of these securities were held in the investment portfolios of our Japanese insurance operations and are yen denominated.  The following table presents our aggregate credit exposures to non-U.S. governments and their agencies, dependent state-owned enterprises, financial institutions and local governments:                                       (in millions)       September 30, 2013      December 31, 2012*            Japan         $   6,576    $ 8,109      Canada           2,760      2,718      France           1,882      1,207      Germany            1,371      1,446      Brazil           1,292      601      China           1,027      926      South Korea            677      693      Singapore           623      631      United Kingdom           599      816      Mexico            574      552      Other           5,856      6,032          Total         $   23,237    $ 23,731            * The prior period has been changed to reflect the inclusion of Brazil and the exclusion of Australia.      173      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Financial Institution Concentrations     Our single largest industry credit exposure at September 30, 2013 was to the global financial institutions sector as a whole, which includes banks and finance companies, securities firms, and insurance and reinsurance companies, many of which can be highly correlated at times of market stress. As of September 30, 2013, credit exposure to this sector was $78.4 billion, or 79 percent of Total equity, compared to 87 percent at December 31, 2012.  At September 30, 2013:  •$73.6 billion, or 94 percent, of these global financial institution credit exposures were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings.  •$4.8 billion, or 6 percent, were considered non-investment grade based on our internal ratings. Aggregate credit exposure to the ten largest below investment grade-rated financial institutions was $1.9 billion.  •Our aggregate credit exposure to fixed maturity securities of the financial institution sector amounted to $32.4 billion.   •Short-term bank deposit placements, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by financial institutions (primarily commercial banks), operating account balances with banks and bank-issued commercial letters of credit supporting insurance credit exposures were $12.9 billion, or 16 percent of the total global financial institution credit exposure.  •The remaining credit exposures to this sector were primarily related to reinsurance recoverables, collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions, derivatives, and captive fronting risk management programs for these financial institutions.      European Concentrations     We actively monitor our European credit exposures, especially those exposures to issuers in the Euro-Zone periphery. We use various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine the need for mitigating actions. As a mitigating action, we typically decide not to renew maturing exposures or, when the opportunity presents itself, to sell or to tender securities. To date, we have not actively used credit default protection. We periodically evaluate the financial condition of issuers and adjust internal risk ratings as warranted.  The result of these continuing reviews has led us to believe that our combined credit risk exposures in the Euro-Zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers.     174      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  The following table presents our aggregate United Kingdom and European credit exposures (excluding ILFC) by major sector:                                                      September 30, 2013           (in millions)      Sovereign      Financial Institution      Non- Financial Corporates      Structured Products/ Other*      Total      December 31, 2012 Total            Euro-Zone countries:                                                               France         $   1,882           $   2,859           $   7,298           $   186           $   12,225    $ 10,533      Germany           1,371             4,006              4,460             61             9,898      9,248      Netherlands           235             4,427             2,284              1,590             8,536      8,333      Spain            158             725             2,330             212              3,425      4,067      Italy           95             363              1,907             221             2,586      2,848      Belgium           419             208             973               –             1,600      1,174      Ireland             –             258             1,026              –              1,284      1,018      Luxembourg            –             17              644             49             710      666      Finland           141             33             322               –             496      432      Austria            115             153             203              –              471      523      Other Euro-Zone           30             28              196             11             265      306          Total Euro-Zone         $   4,446           $   13,077           $   21,643           $   2,330           $   41,496    $ 39,148          Remainder of Europe                                                               United Kingdom       $   599         $   7,867         $   15,653         $   4,844         $   28,963    $ 30,372      Switzerland            73             5,286             2,631              –              7,990      7,290      Sweden           117             2,699              570              –             3,386      3,643      Other remainder of Europe           1,072             1,045             3,292              689             6,098      5,612          Total remainder of Europe       $   1,861         $   16,897         $   22,146         $   5,533         $   46,437    $ 46,917          Total         $   6,307           $   29,974           $   43,789           $   7,863           $   87,933    $ 86,065            * Other represents mortgage guaranty insurance risk-in-force ($417 million), primarily in Italy ($173 million) and Spain ($110 million).   Aggregate credit exposure to European governments totaled $6.3 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2012. Many of the European governments' ratings have been downgraded by one or more of the major rating agencies, occurring mostly in countries in the Euro-Zone periphery where our government credit exposures (Spain, Italy and Portugal) totaled $256 million at September 30, 2013. The downgrades primarily reflect continued recessionary conditions, large government budget deficits, rising government debt-to-GDP ratios and large financing requirements of these countries. These credit exposures primarily included available-for-sale and trading securities (at fair value) issued by these governments. At September 30, 2013, we had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of Greece, Ireland, or Cyprus.  Our exposure to European financial institutions at September 30, 2013 included $18.3 billion of credit exposures to European banks, of which $17.0 billion were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings. Aggregate below investment grade-rated credit exposures to European banks were $1.3 billion. Our credit exposures to banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries totaled $8.3 billion at September 30, 2013, of which $4.6 billion were fixed maturity securities. Credit exposures to banks based in the Euro-Zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal) totaled $1.1 billion, of which $770 million were fixed maturity securities. These credit exposures were primarily to the largest banks in Spain and Italy. Credit exposures to banks based in France totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2013, of which $880 million were fixed maturity securities.  In addition, our exposure at September 30, 2013 to European financial institutions included $11.7 billion of aggregate credit exposure to non-bank institutions, mostly insurers and reinsurers, with $9.1 billion, or 77 percent, of credit exposure representing reinsurance recoverable balances. Reinsurance recoverables were primarily to highly rated reinsurers based in Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. At September 30, 2013, $1.5 billion of the aggregate credit exposure to non-banks was fixed maturity securities, all of which were considered investment grade based on our internal ratings.  Of the $21.6 billion of non-financial institution corporate exposure to Euro-Zone countries at September 30, 2013, 94 percent was to fixed maturity securities ($11.3 billion) and insurance-related products ($9.0 billion), with the majority     175      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  of the insurance exposures being trade credit insurance ($3.5 billion), captive fronting programs ($3.4 billion), and surety bonds ($1.4 billion). Our exposure to France of $7.3 billion at September 30, 2013 represented the largest single non-financial corporate country exposure within the Euro-Zone, of which $2.8 billion were fixed maturity securities. Approximately two-thirds of the French exposures were to issuers in the utilities, oil and gas, and telecommunications industries. Euro-Zone periphery non-financial institution corporate exposures ($5.4 billion) at September 30, 2013 were heavily weighted towards large multinational corporations or issuers in relatively stable industries, such as regulated utilities (22 percent), telecommunications (14 percent), and oil and gas (9 percent).  Of the $7.4 billion at September 30, 2013 of United Kingdom and European structured product exposures (largely consisting of residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities), United Kingdom structured products accounted for 72 percent, while the Netherlands and France comprised 21 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Structured product exposures to the Euro-Zone periphery accounted for 2 percent of the total. Approximately 83 percent of the United Kingdom and European structured products exposures were rated A or better at September 30, 2013 based on external rating agency ratings.  In addition, we had commercial real estate related net equity investments in Europe totaling $325 million and related unfunded commitments of $82 million at September 30, 2013.

European financial institution fixed maturity securities exposure was $9.9 billion, of which $1.1 billion were covered bonds (debt securities secured by a pool of financial assets sufficient to cover any bondholder claims and that have full recourse to the issuing bank). During the third quarter of 2013, $4.6 billion of fixed maturity securities were issued by banks domiciled in the Euro-Zone countries. Our subordinated debt holdings and Tier 1 and preference share securities in these banks totaled $850 million and $303 million, respectively, at September 30, 2013. These exposures were predominantly to the largest banks in those countries.      Other Credit Concentrations     We have a risk concentration in the U.S. municipal sector, primarily through the investment portfolios of our insurance companies. A majority of these securities were held in available-for-sale portfolios of our domestic property and casualty insurance companies. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details. We had $521 million of additional exposure to the municipal sector outside of our insurance company portfolios at September 30, 2013, compared to $464 million at December 31, 2012. These exposures consisted of derivatives and trading securities (at fair value), and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations.  We have a risk concentration in the residential mortgage sector in the form of non-agency RMBS, CDO of RMBS as well as our mortgage guaranty insurance business. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments herein for further details on RMBS and CDO investments. The net risk-in-force for UGC was $37.5 billion at September 30, 2013, of which exposure in the United States was $35.9 billion. At September 30, 2013, UGC had no concentration of exposure in any one state that exceeded 10 percent of UGC's total United States exposure.  We also have a risk concentration in the commercial real estate sector in the form of non-agency CMBS, CDO and CMBS as well as commercial mortgage whole loans and equity investments in commercial real estate. See Investments — Available for Sale Investments and Investments — Commercial Mortgage Loans herein for further details.  We also monitor our aggregate cross-border exposures by country and region. Cross-border exposure is defined as an underlying risk that is taken within a country or jurisdiction other than the country or jurisdiction in which an AIG business unit taking the risk is domiciled. These cross-border exposures include both aggregated cross-border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and cross-border investments in our own international subsidiaries. Six countries had cross-border exposures in excess of 10 percent of Total equity at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Based on our internal risk ratings, at September 30, 2013, three countries were rated AAA, two were rated AA, and one was rated A. The two largest cross-border exposures were to the United Kingdom and Bermuda.  We regularly review concentration reports in the categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads. We periodically adjust limits and review exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that we do not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that our credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units.      Market Risk Management     Market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices, foreign currencies, and their levels of volatility.  We are exposed to market risks, primarily within our insurance businesses and GCM. In our insurance operations, market risk results primarily from potential mismatches in our asset-liability exposures, rather than speculative positioning. Specifically, our life insurance and retirement businesses collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long-term, fixed maturity securities. We earn a spread between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders. We manage the business so that the cash flows from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due, without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market. In periods of severe market volatility, depressed and illiquid fair values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders' equity even without actual credit event related losses.     177      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  Our market exposures can be categorized as follows:  •  Benchmark interest rates. Benchmark interest rates are associated with either the government/treasury yield curve or the swap curve. The fair value of our significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change.   •  Credit spread or risk premium. Credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument.  •  Equity and alternative investment prices. We are exposed to equity and alternative investment prices affecting a variety of instruments. These include direct investments in common stock and mutual funds, minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and other equity-like investments, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, private equity investments, commercial real estate and real estate funds.  •  Foreign currency exchange rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies.       We use a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify our market risk exposure, including:     Duration/key rate duration. Duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed-income instrument to the changes in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve.    Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets.     Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.    VaR. Value at Risk (VaR) is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors, and a management-determined level of confidence, to estimate how frequently a portfolio of risk exposures could be expected to lose at least a specified amount. As an example, Federal Reserve's Market Risk Measure specifies a VaR based approach to calculate market risk equivalent assets for capital ratio calculations.     Insurance Operations Portfolio Sensitivities     The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:                                                              Exposure          Effect        (dollars in millions)       September 30, 2013      December 31, 2012      Sensitivity Factor       September 30, 2013      December 31, 2012            Yield sensitive assets         $   291,211     $ 305,809   100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves       $   (14,956    )  $ (15,786 )    Equity and alternative                    20% decline in stock prices and value of                       investments exposure       $   27,511     $ 27,131    alternative investments         $   (5,502    )  $ (5,426 )    Foreign currency exchange                   10% depreciation of all foreign currency                       rates net exposure         $   9,200     $ 9,106    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar       $   (920    )  $ (911 )           Exposures to yield curve movements include fixed maturity securities, loans, finance receivables and short-term investments, but exclude consolidated separate account assets. Total yield-sensitive assets decreased 4.8 percent, or approximately $14.6 billion, compared to December 31, 2012, primarily due to a net decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of $12.2 billion, and a decrease in cash equivalents of $2.4 billion.  Exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stock, preferred stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, commercial real estate and real estate funds, but exclude consolidated     178      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds. Total exposure in these areas increased 1.4 percent, or approximately $380 million, compared to December 31, 2012, primarily due to an increase of $310 million related to alternative investments and an increase in common equity securities of $311 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other equity investments of $126 million, a decrease in real estate investments of $70 million and decrease in mutual fund value of $45 million.  Exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect our consolidated non-U.S. dollar net capital investments on a GAAP basis. Foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 1.0 percent, or $94 million, compared to December 31, 2012. This was primarily due to an increase in Hong Kong dollar exposure of $592 million resulting from AIG Life and Retirement's investment in PICC Group, an increase in Japanese yen exposure of $499 million resulting from AIG Property Casualty Japan's operations and unrealized appreciation of investments, and an increase in Israeli shekel exposure of $101 million resulting from the increase in our ownership of AIG Israel Insurance Company Limited to 100 percent from 50 percent. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in Canadian dollar exposure of $232 million from the operations of AIG Insurance Company of Canada, a decrease in Euro exposure of $202 million resulting from the operations of AIG Europe Limited (France branch), a decrease in Euro exposure of $149 resulting from AI Overseas Associations (AIOA) IBNR reserves adjustments, and decreases in the British pound and Australian dollar exposures of $137 million and $102 million, respectively, resulting from the weakening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. This should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.      Liquidity Risk Management     Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations.  The failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, and reputational harm. Because liquidity is critically important, our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address both AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.  Sources of Liquidity risk can include, but are not limited to:  •financial market movements — significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies. Changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions, inadequate market depth, or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets;  •potential reputational events or credit downgrade — changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements; and  •catastrophic events, including natural and man-made disasters, that can increase policyholder claims.  The principal objective of ERM's liquidity risk framework is to protect AIG's liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods.  We defined our risk appetite to include a liquidity target. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a two-year time horizon designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine the appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.  Additionally, each business unit is responsible for managing liquidity within a framework designed for the measurement and monitoring of liquidity risks inherent in that business. Current cash and liquidity positions are reviewed for changes and against minimum liquidity levels. Future cash inflows and outflows are tracked through cash flow forecasting. If the business unit projects a breach of the minimum liquidity levels, the amount of required liquidity resources will be identified and we will determine any actions to be taken. Business unit level key indicators are assessed to provide advance warning of potential liquidity risks.     179                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES      Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.       The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:    •Classification of ILFC as held for sale and related fair value measurement;   •Insurance liabilities, including property casualty and mortgage guaranty unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;  •Income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;  •Recoverability of assets, including reinsurance assets;  •Estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;  •Other-than-temporary impairments of financial instruments;  •Liabilities for legal contingencies; and  •Fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.   See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. The following discussion updates critical accounting estimates included in the 2012 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, you should read this section in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2012 Annual Report.      Classification of ILFC as Held for Sale and Related Fair Value Measurement     We report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months, which may require significant judgment, and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized.  On December 9, 2012, American International Group, Inc. (AIG Parent), AIG Capital Corporation (Seller), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of AIG Parent and the sole shareholder of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), and Jumbo Acquisition Limited (Purchaser) entered into a definitive agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) for the sale of 80.1 percent of the common stock of ILFC for approximately $4.2 billion in cash (the ILFC Transaction). The Share Purchase Agreement permits the Purchaser to elect to purchase an additional 9.9 percent of the common stock of ILFC for $522.5 million (the Option). On June 15, 2013, AIG Parent, Seller and Purchaser entered into an amendment (the Amendment) to the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated May 10, 2013. The Amendment extended to July 31, 2013, the date on which any of AIG Parent, Seller or Purchaser may terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, as amended, if the closing of the ILFC Transaction had not yet occurred. Under the Amendment, AIG Parent and Seller may pursue (but not enter into definitive documentation for, or consummate) other offers for ILFC and may continue to pursue (but not engage in widespread solicitation of orders for, or request effectiveness of) the alternative of a public offering.     180      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  On July 15, 2013, the Purchaser delivered notice that it intended to exercise the Option, raising the size of the total purchase to 90 percent of the common stock of ILFC.  As of October 31, 2013, the closing of the ILFC Transaction has not occurred. We continue to consider ILFC as a non-core business and we are continuing to pursue other options including a sale or initial public offering. We determined ILFC met the criteria for held for sale and discontinued operations accounting at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.      Recoverability of Net Deferred Tax Asset     The evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.  We consider a number of factors in order to reliably estimate future taxable income, so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses (NOLs), foreign tax credits (FTCs) and other capital loss carryforwards. These factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG-specific conditions and events. We also subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. We also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies and stress scenarios, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes (other than life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards) prior to their expiration.  Our ability to utilize AIG Life and Retirement's capital loss carryforwards depends, in part, on our ability to sell fixed maturity securities in a gain position. Changes in market conditions, including interest rates rising in excess of our projections, may result in a reduction in projected taxable gains and increases to certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances.  See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset.      Fair Value Measurements of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities     See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and our accounting policy regarding the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.  The following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities by source of value determination:                         September 30, 2013 (in billions)      Fair Value   Percent of Total            Fair value based on external sources(a)   $ 269     94 %    Fair value based on internal sources     18     6          Total fixed maturity and equity securities(b)   $ 287     100 %            (a) Includes $25 billion for which the primary source is broker quotes.  (b) Includes available for sale and trading securities.     Level 3 Assets and Liabilities     Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.     181      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  The following table presents the amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3:                                                (in billions)       September 30, 2013      Percentage of Total      December 31, 2012      Percentage of Total            Assets         $   45.4             8.4    %  $ 40.5     7.4 %    Liabilities           2.7             0.6       4.1     0.9           Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. We consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.  We classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.  The following paragraphs describe the methods we use to measure fair value on a recurring basis for super senior credit default swaps classified in Level 3. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for other assets classified in Level 3, including certain fixed maturity securities and certain other invested assets, and Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein for a discussion of transfers of Level 3 assets and liabilities.    Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio     The entities included in GCM wrote credit protection on the super senior risk layer of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), multi-sector CDOs and diversified portfolios of corporate debt and prime residential mortgages through 2006. In these transactions, we are at risk of credit performance on the super senior risk layer related to such assets.  See Notes 5 and 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Regulatory Capital, Multi-Sector CDO, Corporate Debt/CLO and other portfolios.  We utilize sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on our calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio. For the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi-sector CDO credit default swap portfolio, the change in valuation derived using the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. Of the total $3.4 billion net notional amount of CDS written on multi-sector CDOs outstanding at September 30, 2013, a BET value is available for $2.3 billion net notional amount. No BET value is determined for $1.1 billion of CDS written on European multi-sector CDOs because prices on the underlying securities held by these CDOs are not provided by collateral managers; instead these CDS are valued using counterparty prices. Therefore, sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of $2.3 billion.     182      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  The following table presents key inputs used in the BET model, and the potential increase (decrease) to the fair value of the derivative liability by ABS category at September 30, 2013 corresponding to changes in these key inputs:                                                                  Increase (Decrease) to Fair Value of Derivative Liability       (dollars in millions)      Average Inputs Used at September 30, 2013      Change           Entire Portfolio           RMBS Prime      RMBS Alt-A      RMBS Subprime      CMBS      CDOs      Other            Bond prices   46 points   Increase of 5 points        $ (113 )      $ (2 ) $ (6 ) $ (49 ) $ (39 ) $ (8 ) $ (9 )           Decrease of 5 points          115          2     6     45     40     8     14           Weighted       Increase of 1 year          8          –     –     5     3     –     –      average life   5.76 years   Decrease of 1 year          (10 )        –     –     (7 )   (3 )   –     –           Recovery rates   17%   Increase of 10%          (7 )        –     (1 )   (4 )   (1 )   (1 )   –             Decrease of 10%          10          –     1     7     1     1     –           Diversity score(a)   13   Increase of 5          (3 )                                                    Decrease of 5          8                                                    Discount curve(b)   N/A   Increase of 100bps          2                                                      (a) The diversity score is an input at the CDO level.

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.  In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013 and in Part I, Item 1. Business — Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation, Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulation and Supervision and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2012 Annual Report.      Federal Reserve Supervision     On July 8, 2013, AIG received notice from the U.S. Treasury that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) has made a final determination that AIG should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). As a SIFI, we are regulated by the FRB both in that capacity and, for as long as AIG continues to control an insured depository institution, in our capacity as a savings and loan holding company (SLHC). The regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other. We will also be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including heightened prudential standards. For a description of those standards as currently proposed and a discussion of the potential effects on us as a SIFI, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013. AIG is working to restructure AIG Federal Savings Bank into a trust-only thrift and deregister AIG as a SLHC.      Other Regulatory Developments     As described below, AIG has been designated as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII).  In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). IAIS's ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries' financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority.  The FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS has provided its assessment template to the     184      Table of Contents   ITEM 2 / REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, identified an initial list of G-SIIs, which includes AIG. As a G-SII, AIG will be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision and higher loss absorbency capital requirements. It is expected that the G-SII policy framework will be fully implemented by 2019.  The IAIS is also developing a ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. As currently delineated under the ComFrame, AIG meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. While we currently do not know when any ComFrame directives will be finalized and become effective, the IAIS will undertake a field testing of the ComFrame, including the possibility of additional capital requirements for IAIGs, which is expected to commence in the beginning of 2014. It is expected that implementation of the ComFrame would begin in 2019.  Legislation in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective in 2016, reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we, along with other insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.  We expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Model Regulation "Valuation of Life Insurance Policies" (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs.  On September 11, 2013, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced it would no longer implement a modified principles-based reserving approach for certain in-force ULSGs, which had been developed by a Joint Working Group of the NAIC. As a result, New York-licensed insurers will be required to record additional reserves on a statutory basis for ULSG products issued between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012. The decision from the NYDFS does not affect reserves for products issued on or after January 1, 2013.  AIG Life and Retirement expects to record a total of approximately $200 million of additional reserves on a statutory basis by December 31, 2013 to fully comply with the NYDFS decision. This additional statutory reserve requirement will not affect AIG's capital management strategy, and our Life and Retirement insurance subsidiaries will continue to maintain capital at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary's projected company action level RBC under the CMAs. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2013, our AIG Life and Retirement New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary paid an extraordinary dividend, which was ultimately funded to AIG Parent, in the amount of $219 million.     185                Table of Contents    ITEM 2 / GLOSSARY   Glossary   Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.  Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting, and the change in deferred acquisition costs. Acquisition costs that are incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are deferred and recognized over the coverage periods of related insurance contracts. Acquisition costs that are not incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are recognized as incurred.  Additional premium/Return premium is a premium due either to or from an insured as a result of a change in coverage (e.g. increase/decrease limits or risk) or cancellation of an existing policy. In addition, certain policies provide for adjustments to the original premium amount charged based on the experience of the policy, e.g. workers' compensation policies and loss sensitive policies where changes to the original premium are based on variances of the loss history against estimates built into the determination of the original premium.  AIG — After-tax operating income (loss) attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income (loss) attributable to AIG: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net loss (gain) on sale of divested businesses and properties, income from divested businesses, legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments, legal reserves (settlements) related to "legacy crisis matters," deferred income tax valuation allowance (releases) charges, changes in fair values of AIG Life and Retirement fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital (gains) losses, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net realized capital (gains) losses, non-qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital (gains) losses, and bargain purchase gain. "Legacy crisis matters" include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by AIG as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.  AIG Life and Retirement — Pre-tax operating income (loss) Pre-tax operating income (loss) is derived by excluding the following items from pre-tax income (loss): legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters, changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense), net realized capital (gains) losses, and changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital (gains) losses.  AIG Life and Retirement — Premiums and deposits includes amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts and mutual funds.  AIG Property Casualty — Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period.
