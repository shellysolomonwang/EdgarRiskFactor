Some of the measurements we use are “non‑GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for “accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.” The non‑GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‑named measures reported by other companies. Book Value Per Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets represent U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. Amounts are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA, by Total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA are used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate the effect of non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets represent U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. Amounts are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI and DTA. The reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Overview section of this MD&A. We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A on a consolidated basis.     76       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      After-tax operating income attributable to AIG is derived by excluding the following items from net income attributable to AIG:    • deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges; • changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense); • changes in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired (VOBA), and sales inducement assets (SIA) related to net realized capital gains and losses; • other income and expense — net, related to Corporate and Other run-off insurance lines; • loss on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • non‑qualifying derivative hedging activities, excluding net realized capital gains and losses;   • income or loss from discontinued operations; • income and loss from divested businesses, including:  • gain on the sale of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC); and • certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and related tax effects; • legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments; and • legal reserves and settlements related to legacy crisis matters, which include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our September 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters.      We use the following operating performance measures within our Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reportable segments as well as Corporate and Other. · Commercial Insurance: Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty; Consumer Insurance: Personal Insurance · Pre‑tax operating income: includes both underwriting income and loss and net investment income, but excludes net realized capital gains and losses, other income and expense — net and legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above. Underwriting income and loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses and general operating expenses. · Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. · Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each.     77       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES      · Commercial Insurance: Institutional Markets; Consumer Insurance: Retirement and Life • Pre‑tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income:     • changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities (net of interest expense);   • changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; and     • net realized capital gains and losses;   • legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above.    · Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts and mutual funds. · Corporate and Other — Pre‑tax operating income and loss is derived by excluding the following items from pre‑tax income and loss:    • loss on extinguishment of debt; • net realized capital gains and losses; • changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains and losses; • income and loss from divested businesses, including Aircraft Leasing;   • net gain or loss on sale of divested businesses, including: · gain on the sale of ILFC; and  · certain post-acquisition transaction expenses incurred by AerCap in connection with its acquisition of ILFC and the difference between expensing AerCap’s maintenance rights assets over the remaining lease term as compared to the remaining economic life of the related aircraft and our share of AerCap’s income taxes; and • certain legal reserves (settlements) related to legacy crisis matters described above.    Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.      78       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW          EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW    This overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG’s securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, together with the 2014 Annual Report, in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.  We report our results of operations as follows: · Commercial Insurance – Commercial Insurance offers insurance products and services to commercial and institutional customers worldwide. Commercial Insurance product lines include Casualty, Property, Specialty, Financial, mortgage insurance, stable value wraps, structured settlement and terminal funding annuities. Commercial Insurance products are distributed through a diversified multichannel distribution network that includes insurance brokers, banks, mortgage lenders, specialized marketing and consulting firms.  · Consumer Insurance – Consumer Insurance offers a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and property casualty products and services to individuals and groups. Consumer Insurance products include term life, whole life, universal life, accident & health (A&H), variable and index annuities, fixed annuities, group retirement plans, mutual funds, financial planning, automobile and homeowners insurance, travel insurance, and warranty and service programs. Consumer Insurance offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes broker-dealers, agencies and independent marketing organizations, banks, brokers, partnerships, travel agents, affiliated agents and financial advisors, and direct-to-consumer platforms.  · Corporate and Other – Corporate and Other consists of income from assets held by AIG Parent and other corporate subsidiaries, general operating expenses not attributable to specific reportable segments and interest expense. It also includes run-off lines of insurance business, including excess workers’ compensation, asbestos and legacy environmental (1986 and prior), certain environmental liability businesses written prior to 2004 and certain long-duration business, primarily in Japan and the U.S.   As a result of the progress of the wind down and de-risking activities of the Direct Investment book (DIB) and the derivative portfolio of AIG Financial Products Corp. and related subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP) included within Global Capital Markets (GCM), AIG has discontinued separate reporting of the DIB and GCM. Their results are reported within Income from other assets, net, beginning with the first quarter of 2015. This reporting aligns with the manner in which AIG manages its financial resources. Prior periods are presented in the historical format for informational purposes. AIG borrowings supported by assets continue to be managed as such with assets allocated to support the timely repayment of those liabilities. Assets previously held in the DIB and GCM that are otherwise not required to meet the obligations and capital requirements of the DIB and GCM have been made available to AIG Parent.        79       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Executive Summary Financial Performance         Commercial Insurance pre‑tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in underwriting income in Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty, as well as lower net investment income in Institutional Markets, partially offset by an increase in net investment income in Property Casualty. Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in underwriting income in Property Casualty and reduced net investment income in Institutional Markets. Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to less favorable mortality experience in Life and lower base net investment income, which reflected lower average assets principally due to dividend payments to AIG Parent during the past twelve months as well as declining yields on reinvestments. These decreases were partially offset by strong alternative investment income performance, and higher policy and advisory fees in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by growth in separate account assets under management in Retirement. Pre-tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower base net investment income and less favorable mortality experience in Life, partially offset by higher policy and advisory fees due to growth in separate account assets under management in Retirement. Our investment portfolio performance declined in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected, partially offset by higher income on alternative investments. Our investment portfolio performance declined in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on alternative investments and investments for which the fair value option was elected. Net realized capital gains decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower realized capital gains from sales of investments and an increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges. Net realized capital gains increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher realized capital gains from sales of investments and fair value gains on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges, compared to fair value losses in the same period in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges.     80       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Our Performance – Selected Indicators                              Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended                         June 30,       June 30,         (in millions, except per share data and ratios)                   2015       2014           2015           2014         Results of operations data:                                                             Total revenues               $   15,699   $   16,136       $   31,674       $   32,299         Income from continuing operations                   1,775       3,006           4,251           4,665         Net income attributable to AIG                   1,800       3,073           4,268           4,682         Net income per common share attributable to AIG                                                             (diluted)                   1.32       2.10           3.10           3.19         After-tax operating income attributable to AIG                   1,893       1,796           3,584           3,537         After-tax operating income per common share                                                             attributable to AIG (diluted)                   1.39       1.23           2.60           2.41         Key metrics:                                                             Commercial Insurance                                                             Pre-tax operating income                   1,500       1,625           2,962           3,046         Property Casualty combined ratio                   98.8       96.5           97.9           97.6         Property Casualty accident year combined ratio, as                                                             adjusted                   94.6       95.3           93.9           94.9         Property Casualty net premiums written               $   5,583   $   5,813       $   10,630       $   10,819         Mortgage Guaranty domestic first-lien new insurance                                                             written                   15,190       11,057           25,732           18,662         Institutional Markets premiums and deposits                   680       195           826           342         Consumer Insurance                                                             Pre-tax operating income                   1,023       1,119           1,968           2,287         Personal Insurance combined ratio                   99.7       98.8           101.5           100.9         Personal Insurance accident year combined ratio, as                                                             adjusted                   99.8       98.7           100.3           99.8         Personal Insurance net premiums written               $   2,930   $   3,177       $   5,845       $   6,305         Retirement premiums and deposits                   6,070       6,167           11,579           12,170         Life premiums and deposits                   1,249       1,207           2,472           2,394         Life Insurance Companies assets under management               336,881       332,812           336,881           332,812                                                                                                           June 30,           December 31,         (in millions, except per share data)                                       2015           2014         Balance sheet data:                                                             Total assets                                   $   509,987       $   515,581         Long-term debt                                       30,360           31,217         Total AIG shareholders’ equity                                       104,258           106,898         Book value per common share                                       79.74           77.69         Book value per common share, excluding AOCI                                       73.91           69.98         Book value per common share, excluding AOCI and DTA                                       62.22           58.23              81       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW             Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended       Year Ended             June 30,       June 30,       December 31,             2015       2014               2015           2014           2014         Return on equity   6.8   %   11.6   %           8.0   %       9.0   %       7.1   %     Return on equity -

Investment Highlights         Net investment income decreased to $3.8 billion in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to $3.9 billion in the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on assets for which the fair value option was elected, partially offset by higher income on alternative investments. Net investment income decreased to $7.7 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to $8.1 billion in the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields, lower income on alternative investments, and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2015 from approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 due to an increase in interest rates and widening of investment grade credit spreads. The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity securities portfolio remains largely unchanged from December 31, 2014.     84       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights         We reduced our debt by $857 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 as a result of maturities, repayments and repurchases of $3.8 billion, offset in part by new debt issuances. We maintained financial flexibility at AIG Parent in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 through $1.3 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $3.4 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies. The dividends that AIG Parent received in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included $2.8 billion of dividends that were declared during the fourth quarter of 2014. Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), by an additional $5.0 billion on August 3, 2015, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization at such time of approximately $6.3 billion of AIG Common Stock. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased approximately 69 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.7 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 3.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in January 2015 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 plan, from July 1 to July 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $965 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock. We paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share on each of March 26, 2015 and June 25, 2015. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on August 3, 2015 of $0.28 per share, payable on September 28, 2015 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2015. Strategic Outlook Industry Trends         Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2015, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global markets and slowing growth in emerging markets, China and Euro-Zone economies.  Interest rates remain low relative to historical levels, which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines. Currency volatility in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 was particularly acute compared to the same periods in the prior year, as the three major foreign currencies that we transact in weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar. Such volatility affects line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.  These currencies may continue to fluctuate throughout the year, in either direction, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.     85       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      See Results of Operations – Foreign Currency Impact; Results of Operations – Segment Results – Quarterly and Year-to-date Pre-Tax Income Comparison for 2015 and 2014; Results of Operations – Commercial Insurance – Property Casualty Net Premiums Written by Region; and Results of Operations – Consumer Insurance – Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region.    AIG Priorities for 2015     AIG is focused on the following priorities for 2015: · Improve our focus on our customers to understand their challenges and to help solve their problems; · Simplify our operations, which will lead to quicker, better decisions; bring us closer to our customers; and reduce costs;  · Improve our technology infrastructure to better serve customers and distribution partners, increase productivity, reduce expenses, and better position ourselves against our competitors; and · Concentrate on activities that increase our intrinsic value and sustainable profitability.     Outlook for Our Operating Businesses  The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2015 and over the longer term is summarized below. See our 2014 Annual Report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses.  COMMERCIAL INSURANCE Strategic initiatives and Outlook              Executive Overview     Customer —  Aspire to be our customers’ most valued insurer by offering innovative products, excellent service and access to an extensive global network. Strategic Growth — Grow our higher-value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities. Underwriting Excellence — Improve our business portfolio through better pricing and risk selection by using enhanced data, analytics and the application of science to deliver superior risk adjusted returns.  Claims Excellence — Improve claims processes, analytics and tools to deliver superior customer service and decrease our loss ratio. Operational Effectiveness — Continue initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure; implement best practices to improve speed and quality of service. Capital Efficiency — Increase capital fungibility and diversification, streamline our legal entity structure, optimize reinsurance and improve tax efficiency.  Investment Strategy — Increase asset diversification and take advantage of yield enhancement opportunities to meet our capital, liquidity, risk and return objectives.          86       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Commercial Insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels, currency volatility, and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge growth of net investment income and limit growth and profitability in some markets. Due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, Commercial Insurance has sought to modify terms and conditions, grow profitable segments of the business, exit unprofitable businesses and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability. Property Casualty         Property Casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. In the first half of 2015, the property casualty insurance industry experienced modest growth in line with gross national product growth in the U.S. and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets. Property Casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions. Since the second quarter of 2014, within the U.S. commercial property business, Property Casualty observed continued rate pressure in the U.S. Excess and Surplus lines market, particularly with respect to its natural catastrophe-exposed business. Property Casualty continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging management’s significant experience with catastrophic events, providing loss prevention expertise and maintaining discipline in pricing to internal targets despite intense competition. In the U.S., Property Casualty’s exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. For additional information on TRIA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reserves and Exposures and Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks — Terrorism Risk in our 2014 Annual Report. Mortgage Guaranty         During the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, the U.S. market experienced an increase in mortgage loan originations primarily driven by a decrease in residential  mortgage  interest  rates.  If reduced interest rates persist Mortgage Guaranty expects to benefit through increased volume driven by both refinancing activity for policies prior to 2012 and purchase volume. Mortgage Guaranty also expects then-prevailing low mortgage interest rates to have  a  favorable  impact on the  persistency of business  written  in  2012 and the first half of 2013, since  refinancing  those  mortgages issued at the lower residential mortgage interest rates prevalent in that time period would  be  unattractive  to  homeowners  who originated mortgages  during  that  period.   Mortgage Guaranty also  expects  that  newly  reported  delinquencies  will  continue to decline  during  the remainder of 2015.  Mortgage Guaranty believes  the  combination  of  the factors described above will  result  in  favorable  operating  results  for  the remainder of 2015.  On July 10, 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the GSEs) issued in draft form for public comment new eligibility requirements for private mortgage insurers that provide insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by them. On April 17, 2015, the final eligibility requirements were issued. The new requirements, which will be effective on December 31, 2015, will mandate mortgage insurers to hold specified levels and types of assets in order to be able to pay a prescribed level of claims in certain stress scenarios. Mortgage Guaranty will meet these requirements on the effective date. On June 30, 2015, the GSEs revised the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIER). The most significant change in the revised PMIER is a surcharge to the asset requirement for lender-paid mortgage insurance for mortgages originated after December 31, 2015. These new requirements are not expected to have a material effect on AIG’s financial flexibility.     87       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Institutional Markets         Institutional Markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management from the stable value wrap business, as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to pension buyouts. Volatility in the earnings from our alternative investment portfolio will continue to affect Institutional Markets’ results. Strategic Initiatives          Customer           Our vision is to be our customers’ most valued insurer. Our investments in engineering, underwriting, claims services, science and data together are intended to help offer our customers not only innovative products, excellent service and access to an extensive global network but also a superior and rewarding customer experience which can be demonstrated through the implementation of our OneClaim system, a single, global platform to manage the end-to-end claims processing lifecycle for more efficient claims services. Strategic Growth          Property Casualty’s efforts to better segment its business by industry, geography and type of coverage in order to enhance its decision making regarding risk acceptance and pricing are ongoing. For example, after enhancing the segmentation of workers’ compensation, Property Casualty has observed different experience and trends, which helps inform its risk appetite, pricing and loss mitigation decisions. As part of our strategic goal of diversifying our product offerings and providing our customers greater access to unique insurance programs, on March 31, 2015, we paid approximately $239 million to acquire a controlling stake in NSM Insurance Group (NSM), a leading U.S. managing general agent and insurance program administrator, known for its unique development and implementation of programs for a broad range of niche customer segments. We expect the acquisition of NSM to facilitate closer strategic coordination and provide us with access to attractive markets including programs, specialty small commercial insurance solutions, and complementary distribution networks.  Mortgage Guaranty expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing its proprietary risk-based pricing strategy. This pricing strategy provides Mortgage Guaranty’s customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk, which we believe will result in an appropriately priced, high-quality book of business. Institutional Markets is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management with stable value wraps and utilizing a disciplined approach to growth and diversification of our business by pursuing select opportunities in areas such as the pension buyout business. Capital Efficiency            Commercial Insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad‑based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, Commercial Insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency, although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility.     88       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      We also continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency for regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency, particularly with respect to the Non-Life Insurance Companies in the Property Casualty and Personal Insurance operating segments. Our legal entity restructuring initiatives have enhanced dividend capacity and reduced required capital. Additionally, the restructuring allows us to simplify our reinsurance arrangements, which further facilitate increased capital optimization. We expect our overall legal entity restructuring to be substantially completed in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions. consumer insurance STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND Outlook              Strategic Initiatives     Customer — Aspire to be our customers’ most valued insurer. Through our unique franchise, which brings together a broad portfolio of retirement, life insurance and personal insurance products offered through multiple distribution networks, Consumer Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, delivered through the channels they prefer. Information-driven Strategy —  Utilize customer insight, analytics and the application of science to optimize customer acquisition, product profitability, product mix, channel performance and risk management capabilities. Focused Growth — Invest in areas where Consumer Insurance can grow profitably and sustainably. Target growth in select markets according to market size, growth potential, market maturity and customer demographics. Operational Effectiveness — Simplify processes, enhance operating environments, and leverage the best platforms and tools for multiple operating segments to increase competitiveness, improve service and product capabilities and facilitate delivery of our target customer experience. Investment Strategy — Maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that largely matches the duration characteristics of the related insurance liabilities, and pursue yield-enhancement opportunities that meet liquidity, risk and return objectives. Profitability and Capital Management — Deliver solid earnings through disciplined pricing and expense management, sustainable underwriting improvements and diversification of risk, and increase capital efficiency within insurance entities to enhance return on equity.       Market Conditions and Industry Trends           Retirement         Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek financial security as they approach retirement, which continues to drive demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features. In addition, higher tax rates and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk-averse investors to seek products without guaranteed benefits, providing the opportunity to further diversify our product portfolio by offering investment-focused variable annuities.  The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. In addition, more highly leveraged competitors have entered the market offering higher crediting rates. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may lessen the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment.     89       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      In April 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued a proposed regulation that substantially expands the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code. This proposed regulation has generated substantial attention in our industry, with the initial public comment period having concluded on July 21, 2015. The DOL will hold public hearings on the proposed regulation in August 2015, and the proposal is subject to additional regulatory review and potential modification before the final regulation, if any, is adopted. It is unknown at this time whether or how any final regulation may be different from that proposed. If finalized as originally proposed, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to ERISA-covered plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis could be substantially limited from what is allowed under current law. These changes could have a material impact on the types, levels and compensation structures of the investment products and services we provide.  Life         Populations are living longer and have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. The Life operating segment addresses these needs with a broad spectrum of products, ranging from the pure protection focus of term life to indexed universal life and investment-oriented products such as variable universal life. Market factors, primarily low interest rates and regulatory changes, have caused the universal life market to shift its focus from guaranteed universal life to indexed universal life products that offer cash accumulation and living benefit options. Personal Insurance         The overall rate level has improved in the Japanese and certain U.S. markets for auto, personal property, and accident and health products compared to prior years. In Japan, car and home sales increased in the first quarter of 2014 prior to a consumption tax increase, but prospectively, overall market sales are expected to return to normal levels. In the U.S., rate level changes for auto and personal property products are expected to be positive but slow, with sales increasing as the economy continues to improve. Our Personal Insurance operating segment continues to invest in growth economy nations that have a higher growth outlook for personal insurance products. Strategic Initiatives           Customer         We are working to expand relationships with key distribution partners to fully realize the benefits of our diverse product offerings across multiple channels. Our focus on ease of doing business for consumers and producers includes enhancements to our platforms and services, as well as initiatives to improve the recruitment, training and productivity of our affiliated and non-affiliated distribution partners. Information-driven Strategy         We believe that strengthening our direct marketing capabilities through the use of analytics, stronger platforms and tools, an enhanced product portfolio and expanded relationships can allow us to bring more product solutions to our target markets.  We intend to achieve rate adequacy through implementation of global underwriting practices and enhanced tools and analytics, and to optimize the value of our business lines through product and portfolio management and refined technical pricing. We strive to enhance the customer experience and efficiency through claims best practices, and to deploy enhanced operating structures and standardized processes and systems, while managing claims-handling efficiency.     90       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      Focused Growth         Retirement Income Solutions intends to continue capitalizing on the opportunity to meet consumer demand for guaranteed income by maintaining competitive variable annuity product offerings while managing risk through innovative product design and well-developed economic hedging capabilities. Risk mitigation features of its variable annuity product design include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider fees that are indexed to an equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts, and the utilization of volatility control funds. Retirement Income Solutions has a risk management hedging program and continues to invest in market risk management capabilities. Retirement Income Solutions is also focused on diversifying its product portfolio by growing sales of fixed index annuities with guarantee features, which provide additional income solutions for consumers approaching retirement, and introducing new investment-focused variable annuities, which offer various investment options, including alternative asset classes, as well as tax deferral to investors seeking higher returns. Fixed Annuities sales will continue to be challenged by the low interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits. The growing market for immediate and deferred income products, driven by customers seeking guaranteed income products, provides an opportunity for Fixed Annuities to increase the diversification of its product portfolio. Life will continue to invest to position for growth and serve its customers more effectively, and maintain pricing discipline in its overall strategy. Internationally, Life intends to expand its business in Japan, the United Kingdom and certain other countries through a focused strategy in selected markets and products by combining global expertise with local market intelligence to meet the needs of consumers in these target markets. On March 31, 2015, we acquired Laya Healthcare, Ireland’s second largest primary health insurance provider. Laya Healthcare covers approximately 500,000 lives for primary healthcare, and also offers other adjacent coverage including life, dental and travel insurance. Personal Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, distributed through the channels they prefer, and delivered with excellent customer service. Personal Insurance is focused on profitable growth in its selected market segments, with targeted investments in both scale businesses and emerging markets. Personal Insurance will continue to leverage its strong risk management and market expertise to foster growth by providing innovative and competitive solutions to its customers and distributors. Operational Effectiveness         We are continuing to invest in initiatives to enable simpler and more agile low-cost operating models to provide superior service and position our operating platforms to accommodate significant future growth. In Japan, we continue to invest in technology and systems to improve operating efficiency and make it easier for our partners and our customers to do business with us, with the goal of increasing our market share and facilitating our expansion in segments of the market that are expected to grow over the next decade, given demographic trends. In the U.S. Life business, we are focused on leveraging our most efficient systems environments and increased automation of our underwriting process. We believe that these simpler operating models will allow for productivity improvements and enhance our ability to leverage common functionality across product lines and borders, further supporting profitable growth. Profitability and Capital Management         We are focused on enhancing profitability and capital efficiency within our insurance entities through disciplined pricing, in-force profitability management and effective management of risk, using tools such as the risk mitigation product features and risk management hedging program in our Retirement Income Solutions variable annuity business, for products where we have significant equity market risk and exposure to changes in interest rates. Additionally, our scale and the breadth of our product offerings provide diversification of risk. Within our Non-Life Insurance Companies, we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital efficiency.     91       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      See Results of Operations — Consumer Insurance and Insurance Reserves for additional information.

The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations in both periods differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously released to accumulated other comprehensive income, and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign jurisdictions. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, there was a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign jurisdictions primarily attributable to changes in projections of future taxable income. The six-month period ended June 30, 2015 includes an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily attributable to the effects of changes in the Japanese tax law enacted on March 31, 2015, partially offset by changes in projections of future taxable income. For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2014, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 32.9 percent and 30.9 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations in both periods differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income and a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset valuation allowance.

For the three-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 34.3 percent and 33.6 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 33.5 percent and 32.8 percent, respectively. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.      93       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      SEGMENT RESULTS         We report the results of our operations through two reportable segments: Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance.

(Springleaf). Other-than-temporary impairments increased primarily due to an impairment charge of $78 million on our remaining shares of AerCap at June 30,      94       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      2015. Income from divested businesses decreased as a result of the sale of ILFC in the second quarter of 2014. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in legal reserves related to legacy crisis matters and an increase from the change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of economic hedges, as discussed below. Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income also decreased due to lower underwriting income, partially offset by higher net investment income. Pre-tax operating income for Consumer Insurance decreased due to less favorable mortality experience and lower base net investment income, partially offset by higher alternative investment income and growth in policy and advisory fee income. The change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV), net of the change in fair value of all related economic hedges, increased pre-tax income by $95 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in market interest rates in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 resulted in a decrease in the liability for GMWB and GMAV, which was substantially offset by interest rate hedges, including losses in the fair value of bonds used to hedge interest rate risk. In the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, we discontinued our U.S. Treasury bond interest rate hedging program and will be initiating a corporate bond hedging program, which is intended to align with the economics of the hedged risks and provide the same capital efficiency as the previous Treasury bond hedging program. The impact of variable annuity guarantees on pre-tax income includes changes in fair value of the embedded policy derivatives and economic hedges that are reported in Net realized capital gains (losses), as well as changes in fair value of certain bonds that hedge changes in the fair value of GMWB liabilities, which are also excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported in the table above within Change in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities.  YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME COMPARISON FOR 2015 AND 2014  Pre-tax income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing debt management activities and lower income from divested businesses as a result of the sale of ILFC in the second quarter of 2014. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in legal reserves related to legacy crisis matters and an increase from the change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of economic hedges, as discussed below. Higher net realized capital gains from sales of investments, which included realized gains on the sales of Class B shares of Prudential Financial, Inc., a portion of our holdings in PICC P&C shares and common shares of Springleaf, were partially offset by a realized loss on the sale of ordinary shares of AerCap. Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income decreased due to lower underwriting income and lower net investment income. Pre-tax operating income for Consumer Insurance decreased due to lower base net investment income and less favorable mortality experience, partially offset by growth in policy and advisory fee income. The change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity GMWB and GMAV, net of the change in fair value of all related economic hedges, increased pre-tax income by $435 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in market interest rates in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 resulted in a decrease in the liability for GMWB and GMAV, which was substantially offset by interest rate hedges, including losses in the fair value of bonds used to hedge interest rate risk, compared to the same period in the prior year, when an increase in the GMWB and GMAV liability due to a decline in market interest rates was offset to a lesser extent by hedging. Net Investment Income         Net investment income is attributed to the operating segments of Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses. For Commercial Insurance — Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance — Personal Insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves, unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each operating segment. The net investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus a liquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities, and excludes net investment income associated with the      95       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      run-off insurance lines reported in Corporate and Other. The remaining excess is attributed to Commercial Insurance — Property Casualty and Consumer Insurance — Personal Insurance based on the relative net investment income previously allocated. For Commercial Insurance — Institutional Markets, Consumer Insurance — Retirement and Consumer Insurance — Life, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios. Invested assets in excess of liabilities are allocated to product lines based on internal capital estimates. Foreign Currency Impact         Property Casualty, International Life and Personal Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the currencies that have the most significant impact on our businesses:         Three Months Ended                   Six Months Ended                     June 30,       Percentage           June 30,       Percentage         Rate for 1 USD   2015   2014       Change           2015   2014       Change         Currency:                                                 JPY   120.19   102.20       18   %       119.51   102.68       16   %     EUR   0.91   0.73       25   %       0.88   0.73       21   %     GBP   0.66   0.60       10   %       0.66   0.61       8   %    COMMERCIAL INSURANCE         Commercial Insurance presents its financial information in three operating segments – Property Casualty, Mortgage Guaranty and Institutional Markets.

The decrease in underwriting income reflected higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development and higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by an increase in net loss reserve discount benefit for workers’ compensation reserves, as well as modestly lower severe losses. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments, was $279 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, primarily reflecting commercial automobile liability in U.S. Casualty, compared to overall net favorable prior year loss reserve development of $63 million in the same period in the prior year. See further discussion under Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Loss Development. Catastrophe losses increased to $209 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 from $121 million in the same period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a higher workers’ compensation net loss reserve discount benefit, primarily reflecting the increase in Treasury rates. Net loss reserve discount benefit was $270 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to a benefit of $16 million in the same period in the prior year. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Current accident year losses increased slightly, reflecting higher current accident year losses in U.S. Casualty, as well as higher severe losses in Specialty, partially offset by an improvement in attritional losses in U.S. Property and lower severe property losses, particularly in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, as a result of enhanced risk selection and pricing discipline. The current accident year losses for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 included eight severe losses totaling $184 million compared to seven severe losses totaling $193 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred costs and lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments. General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the cost of employee-incentive plans and efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, which were partially offset by increased technology-related costs. Net investment income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net investment income related to the PICC P&C shares which are accounted for under the fair value option, higher income on alternative investments, and the effect of continued portfolio diversification, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower reinvestment yield.      98       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      See MD&A — Investments for additional information on the Non-Life Insurance Companies invested assets, investment strategy, and asset-liability management process. Property Casualty Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income increased slightly in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net investment income partially offset by a slight decrease in underwriting income. The decrease in underwriting income was driven by an increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development partially offset by an increase in net loss reserve discount benefit for workers’ compensation reserves and lower catastrophe and severe losses. The increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development was primarily due to higher prior year loss reserve development in Casualty partially offset by an improvement in Financial lines and Specialty. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments, was $307 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to $97 million in the same period in the prior year. See further discussion under Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Quarterly and Year-to-Date Net Loss Development. This increase was partially offset by a higher workers’ compensation net loss reserve discount benefit, primarily reflecting the increase in Treasury rates. Net loss reserve discount benefit was $177 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to $142 million in the same period in the prior year. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Catastrophe losses were $280 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to $305 million in the same period in the prior year. The current accident year losses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included 16 severe losses totaling $318 million compared to 16 severe losses totaling $338 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred costs and lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments. General operating expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, which were partially offset by increased technology-related costs. Net investment income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher income on alternative investments and the effect of continued portfolio diversification, partially offset by the lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option, as the increase related to the PICC P&C shares was more than offset by a decrease from fixed maturity investments, lower reinvestment yields, as well as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 increased modestly from the three-month period ended June 30, 2014, while they increased for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the first quarter renewal of a multi-year policy in U.S. Financial lines, and new business growth in Property and Financial lines across all regions. Casualty net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting rate pressure and continued execution of our strategy to enhance risk selection and optimize our product portfolio particularly in the U.S. Additionally, net premiums written included return premiums related to the loss sensitive businesses of $12 million, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to additional premiums of $68 million in the same period in the prior year. Strong new writings in growth targeted products, particularly in EMEA, were more than offset by the declines in certain residual programs. Property net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Japanese yen, an increase in ceded premiums for catastrophe reinsurance protection, as well as increased competition and rate pressure in certain lines, particularly in the U.S. and EMEA. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher retention and new business in Asia Pacific. Specialty net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to new business increases in targeted growth products, particularly in the U.S., and higher retention particularly in EMEA, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Japanese yen. Net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Japanese yen.

These decreases were largely offset by strong growth in new business related to targeted growth products in Financial lines.  Additionally, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net premiums written reflected the renewal of a multi-year E&O policy in the U.S. Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Property Casualty Quarterly and Year-to-Date Insurance Ratios The combined ratio increased by 2.3 points and 0.3 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the loss ratio. The loss ratio increased by 3.1 points and 1.0 point in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher net adverse prior year loss development and higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by an increase in net loss reserve discount benefit. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 0.7 points in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a lower expense ratio partially offset by slightly higher accident year loss ratio, as adjusted. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 1.0 point in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due to both lower accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, and expense ratio. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, increased slightly by 0.1 point in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher current accident year losses in commercial automobile liability in U.S. Casualty, and higher severe losses in Specialty, partially offset by an improvement in attritional losses in U.S. Property and lower severe Property losses in both EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 0.3 points in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting enhanced      104       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      risk selection and pricing discipline resulting in lower attritional losses in U.S. Property, as well as lower severe losses, particularly in EMEA, partially offset by an increase in commercial automobile liability in U.S. Casualty. Severe losses represented approximately 3.6 points and 3.2 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to 3.7 points and 3.3 points, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. The acquisition ratio decreased by 0.3 points and 0.2 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to lower amortization of previously deferred costs and lower premium taxes and guaranty fund and other assessments. The general operating expense ratio decreased by 0.5 points in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the cost of employee incentive plans and efficiencies from organizational realignment initiatives, partially offset by higher technology-related expenses.

Excluding prior year loss reserve development, pre-tax operating income increased due to a decline in incurred losses from lower delinquency rates and higher cure rates. First-Lien Results First-lien pre-tax operating income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to $78 million of favorable prior year loss reserve development recorded in the same period in the prior year, which benefitted from a settlement with a mortgage lender. First-lien net premiums earned in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 increased $5 million compared to the same period in the prior year largely from growth in the business. Excluding prior year loss reserve development, first-lien losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased by $17 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the combined ratio of 29.7 points to 48.4 points in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 from the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the favorable prior year loss reserve development adjustment in the prior year period discussed above. Acquisition expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of sales support activities related to the increase in new insurance written. General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased servicing costs related to the growth of in-force business. Other Business Results Other business results include second-lien insurance, student loan insurance and non-domestic mortgage insurance operations. The Other business’ pre-tax operating income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 was approximately $16 million compared to $12 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a decline in losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses, partially offset by a decrease in net premiums earned and a decline in net investment income.     106       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      Mortgage Guaranty Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in first-lien net premiums earned as a result of higher new insurance written, an acceleration of earnings on the cancellations of single premium business for which a return premium is generally not required, a decline in incurred losses from lower delinquency rates and higher cure rates. First-Lien Results First-lien pre-tax operating income increased $15 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to improved underwriting income as a result of a $26 million increase in first-lien net premiums earned in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, largely from growth in the book of business and the acceleration of premiums earned as a result of cancellations on single premium business, a $7 million decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses, and a $2 million increase in net investment income, offset in part by a $20 million increase in acquisition and general operating expenses. The combined ratio remained consistent at 50.9 points in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to 50.8 points in the same period in the prior year. Acquisition expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of sales support activities related to the increase in new insurance written. General operating expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased servicing costs related to the growth of in-force business. Other Business Results The Other business’ pre-tax operating income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was approximately $29 million compared to $28 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in pre-tax operating income was primarily due to a decline in general operating expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by a decline in net premiums earned and a decline in net investment income. New Insurance Written on Domestic First-Lien Mortgage Loans         In the second quarter of 2015, Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first-lien new insurance written reached its highest level ever, reflecting the expansion in the mortgage originations market caused by a reduction in mortgage interest rates in the first half of 2015. Domestic first-lien new insurance written increased to $15.2 billion and $25.7 billion in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to $11.1 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively, in the same periods in the prior year. Delinquency Inventory         The delinquency inventory for domestic first-lien business declined during the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 as a result of cures and paid claims exceeding the number of newly reported delinquencies. Mortgage Guaranty’s first-lien primary delinquency ratio at June 30, 2015 was 3.6 percent compared to 4.8 percent at June 30, 2014. Over the last several years, Mortgage Guaranty has experienced a decline in newly reported defaults and an increase in cure rates.     107       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / COMMERCIAL INSURANCE      The following table provides a summary of activity in Mortgage Guaranty’s domestic first lien delinquency inventory:    Six Months Ended June 30,                                     (number of policies)                   2015           2014     Number of delinquencies at the beginning of the year                   38,357           47,518     Newly reported                   19,119           23,268     Cures                   (19,604)           (23,744)     Claims paid                   (4,452)           (6,072)     Other                   (772)           (1,169)     Number of delinquencies at the end of the period                   32,648           39,801    Mortgage Guaranty Quarterly and Year-to-Date Underwriting Ratios         The following tables present the Mortgage Guaranty combined ratios based on GAAP data:        Three Months Ended               Six Months Ended                 June 30,       Increase       June 30,       Increase             2015       2014       (Decrease)           2015       2014       (Decrease)     Loss ratio       19.5       (3.1)       22.6           22.4       25.3       (2.9)     Acquisition ratio       8.8       8.4       0.4           9.2       8.2       1.0     General operating expense ratio       17.7       16.4       1.3           17.3       16.9       0.4     Expense ratio       26.5       24.8       1.7           26.5       25.1       1.4     Combined ratio       46.0       21.7       24.3           48.9       50.4       (1.5)    The combined ratio increased by 24.3 points and decreased by 1.5 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, which benefited from a settlement with a mortgage lender. The increase in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 was driven primarily by a reduction in the loss ratio in the prior-year period due to favorable prior year loss reserve development. The decrease in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was driven primarily by lower losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred from fewer new delinquencies and higher cure rates. The acquisition ratio increased by 0.4 points and 1.0 point in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Acquisition expenses increased, primarily due to the increases in expenses related to sales activities supporting new insurance written in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015. The general operating expense ratio increased by 1.3 points and 0.4 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in both periods was primarily due to increased servicing costs related to growth of in-force business.

Fee income increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by growth in reserves and assets under management, primarily from continued development of the stable value wrap business. The notional amount of stable value wrap assets under management at June 30, 2015 grew by $6.5 billion or 25 percent from the prior year, in addition to $2.3 billion of stable value wrap funding agreements included in insurance reserves. The increases in premiums and in benefit expense compared to the same period in the prior year were primarily due to the premium received and establishment of the future policy benefit reserve for a large terminal funding annuity issued in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. Net investment income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower yield enhancements from bond call and tender income, partially offset by higher alternative investment income, which increased by $16 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to strong hedge fund performance in the current year period.

Institutional Markets Premiums, Deposits and Net Flows         For Institutional Markets, premiums represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent payout annuities or structured settlements. Premiums and deposits is a non‑GAAP financial measure that includes direct and assumed premiums as well as deposits received on universal life insurance and investment-type annuity contracts, including GICs and stable value wrap funding agreements. The following table presents a reconciliation of Institutional Markets premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2015       2014           2015       2014     Premiums and deposits   $   680   $   195       $   826   $   342     Deposits       (26)       (29)           (71)       (72)     Other       (11)       (5)           (16)       (10)     Premiums    $   643   $   161       $   739   $   260    The increases in premiums and deposits and in premiums for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily due to a large single premium for a terminal funding annuity agreement issued in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015.

These increases were partially offset by higher DAC amortization in Retirement Income Solutions, primarily due to growth in the business and lower equity market returns compared to the same period in the prior year. Net investment income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an improvement in alternative investment income, including strong hedge fund performance and private equity fund distributions, partially offset by lower base net investment income.     112       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Base net investment income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of lower base yields from reinvestment at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, as well as a decrease in net investment income due to a decline in average assets resulting primarily from dividend payments to AIG Parent during the past twelve months. This overall decrease in base net investment income compared to the same period in the prior year was partially offset in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 by additional accretion on a security held in Group Retirement. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business. Overall, Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 declined compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment. While average interest crediting rates were down slightly due to active rate management, the decline in base yields compressed base spread in Fixed Annuities. Group Retirement base yield also declined compared to the same period in the prior year due to continued reinvestment at lower rates, but this was more than offset by additional accretion income in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. See Spread Management below for additional discussion. General operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due in part to technology investments and higher sales volume in the Retirement Income Solutions product line. Retirement Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income for Retirement in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net investment income, as well as higher DAC amortization in Retirement Income Solutions due to growth in the business and lower equity market returns compared to the same period in the prior year. Base net investment income decreased, which compressed base spreads, but this decrease was partially offset by higher policy fees and advisory fees due to growth in variable annuity separate account assets under management, principally driven by positive net flows. Net investment income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower base net investment income, as discussed below, and a decline in average assets resulting primarily from dividend payments to AIG Parent during the past twelve months. These decreases were partially offset by additional accretion income and an improvement in other enhancement income, primarily due to losses in the same period in the prior year on securities for which the fair value option has been elected, including the investment in People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China Limited then held by the Life Insurance Companies. Base net investment income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the effect of lower base yields from reinvestment at rates below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, as well as a decrease in net investment income due to a lower volume of average assets resulting from dividend payments to AIG Parent during the past twelve months. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional information on the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Retirement business. Overall, Retirement fixed maturity portfolio yields in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 declined compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment. While average interest crediting rates were down slightly due to active rate management, the decline in base yield resulted in spread compression in Fixed Annuities base spreads compared to the same period in the prior year. Group Retirement base spread was flat compared to the same period in the prior year, due to additional accretion income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, which offset the decline in base yield. See Spread Management below for additional discussion. General operating expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, due in part to technology investments and higher sales volume in the Retirement Income Solutions product line.     113       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Spread Management The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the Life Insurance Companies’ asset‑liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability. Disciplined pricing on new business and active crediting rate management are used in the Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement product lines to partially offset the impact of a continued decline in base yields resulting from investment of available cash flows in the low interest rate environment. Disciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of annuity products at targeted net investment spreads in the current rate environment. Retirement has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products that had higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. As a result, new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of one percent. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions in annuity products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Retirement will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields. In addition to deferred annuity products, certain traditional long-duration products for which Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. As of June 30, 2015, Retirement’s fixed annuity reserves, which include fixed options offered within variable annuities sold in the Group Retirement and Retirement Income Solutions product lines as well as reserves of the Fixed Annuities product line, had minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent, with the higher rates representing guarantees on older in-force products. As indicated in the table below, approximately 72 percent of annuity account values were at their minimum crediting rates as of June 30, 2015, compared to 71 percent at December 31, 2014. Fixed annuity account values having contractual minimum guaranteed rates above 1 percent were 77 percent and 79 percent of total fixed annuity reserves at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Retirement premiums and deposits to GAAP premiums:        Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended         June 30,       June 30,     (in millions)       2015       2014           2015       2014     Premiums and deposits*   $   6,070   $   6,167       $   11,579   $   12,170     Deposits       (6,046)       (6,132)           (11,537)       (12,130)     Other       20       62           48       114     Premiums    $   44   $   97       $   90   $   154    * Excludes activity related to closed blocks of fixed and variable annuities. Premiums decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower immediate annuity premiums in the Fixed Annuities product line.

Retail Mutual Funds deposits improved in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, but were below the same period in the prior year in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015. Net flows for annuity products included in the Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. Net flows from mutual funds, which are included in both the Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement product lines, represent deposits less withdrawals.  Total net flows for Retirement in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 were comparable to the same period in the prior year, which reflected a decrease in Fixed Annuities offset by continued growth in Retirement Income Solutions and improvement in net flows for Retail Mutual Funds.  In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, total net flows for Retirement decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net flows from Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement that were partially offset by continued growth in Retirement Income Solutions and a decrease in Retail Mutual Fund withdrawal activity.     116       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Premiums and Deposits and Net Flows by Product Line A discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows: Fixed Annuities deposits and net flows decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, and net flows continued to be negative, primarily due to lower sales in the sustained low interest rate environment. Retirement Income Solutions premiums and deposits and net flows increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting an increase in index annuity sales. The improvement in surrender rates (see Surrender Rates below) for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to the significant growth in account value driven by the high volume of sales, which has increased the proportion of business that is within the surrender charge period. Retail Mutual Fund net flows increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to improvement in the level of withdrawals. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, deposits also improved compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net flows in both periods compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily driven by activity within the Focused Dividend Strategy Fund. Group Retirement net flows in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 were comparable to the same period in the prior year, due to improved surrender activity offset by lower premiums and deposits. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net flows decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, due to both a decrease in premiums and deposits and an increase in surrender activity. The increase in surrenders and the surrender rate for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year included large group surrenders of approximately $475 million. The large group market has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in our target markets.

Increases in other income and general operating expenses in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year were primarily related to international growth, including from the acquisitions of Laya Healthcare and Ageas Protect Limited (now AIG Life Limited).

Life Year-to-Date Results Pre-tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to mortality experience, which was within pricing assumptions but less favorable compared to the same period in the prior year.

Net investment income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower base net investment income, which reflected participation income received on a commercial mortgage loan in the first quarter of 2014. This decrease was partially offset by higher enhancement income, primarily due to losses in the same period in the prior year on securities for which the fair value option has been elected, including the investment in PICC Group then held by the Life Insurance Companies. See Investments – Life Insurance Companies for additional discussion of the investment strategy, asset-liability management process and invested assets of our Life Insurance Companies, which include the invested assets of the Life business. General operating expenses increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily related to expansion of the global Life business, including from the acquisitions described above.  Spread Management         Disciplined pricing on new business is used to pursue new sales of life products at targeted net investment spreads in a low interest rate environment. Life has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Life cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales. Universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non-indexed products and zero to 2 percent on new indexed products, and are designed to meet targeted net investment spreads.  In-force Management.

Catastrophe losses were $16 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to $18 million in the same period in the prior year. Net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $17 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to $16 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, British pound and euro. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, acquisition expenses increased due to higher acquisition costs in countries and lines of business targeted for growth, particularly in automobile and property businesses, and higher profit share expenses related to warranty service programs, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses. Direct marketing expenses, excluding commissions, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 were approximately $80 million, and, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $18 million from the same period in the prior year.  General operating expenses decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, British pound and euro. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, general operating expenses increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and the timing of technology-related initiatives.     121       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Net investment income decreased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the continued impact of low interest rates resulting in yields on new purchases that were lower than the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies, and lower allocation of net investment income.

Personal Insurance Year-to-Date Results Pre‑tax operating income decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net investment income and underwriting results. Catastrophe losses were $77 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to $96 million in the same period in the prior year. Accident year losses include severe losses of approximately $12 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to $41 million in the same period in the prior year. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net favorable prior year loss reserve development was $13 million, compared to $30 million in the same period in the prior year.  Acquisition expenses decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, British pound and euro.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year as the business continued to grow through multiple product and distribution channels.  A&H net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased slightly in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in individual travel business in the U.S., reflecting continued focus on maintaining underwriting discipline, and a decrease in group personal accident business in EMEA due to exposure changes. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written remained essentially unchanged in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting growth in supplemental health, partially offset by the decrease in individual travel business in the U.S., as discussed above. Personal Lines net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased production in the automobile business across all regions and in the property business, primarily in U.S. and Japan, partially offset by decreased production of warranty service programs in the U.S. due to underwriting actions taken in the prior year. In the U.S. property business, the increase was attributable to new business sales, improved retention in the private client group and changes to optimize our reinsurance structure to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, whereas in Japan the increase was due to new business sales.     123       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / results of operations / CONSUMER INSURANCE      Personal Insurance Net Premiums Written by Region         The following table presents Personal Insurance net premiums written by region:        Three Months Ended       Percentage           Percentage           Six Months Ended       Percentage           Percentage             June 30,       Change in           Change in           June 30,       Change in           Change in         (in millions)       2015       2014       U.S. dollars           Original Currency               2015       2014       U.S. dollars           Original Currency         Americas   $   947   $   945       -   %       2   %       $   1,859   $   1,915       (3)   %       (1)   %     Asia Pacific       1,539       1,721       (11)           2               2,969       3,262       (9)           2         EMEA       444       511       (13)           4               1,017       1,128       (10)           5         Total net premiums written   $   2,930   $   3,177       (8)   %       2   %       $   5,845   $   6,305       (7)   %       2   %         Personal insurance NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN by Region   (in millions)      Americas net premiums written increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in personal property and automobile businesses, and changes to optimize our reinsurance structure to retain more favorable risks, while continuing to manage aggregate exposure, partially offset by a decrease in net premiums written in our warranty service programs and a decrease in the individual travel business in the U.S. Net premiums written decreased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in Latin America. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written decreased due to decreases in warranty service programs, individual travel and group accident businesses in the U.S., partially offset by growth in automobile, and personal property businesses. The growth in personal property business is primarily driven by new business sales and improved retention in the U.S. private client group, as well as the changes in the reinsurance structure discussed above. Asia Pacific net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased across all lines of business, primarily due to production increases in supplemental health, automobile and personal property in Japan, partially offset by a decrease in individual personal accident business outside of Japan.  EMEA net premiums written decreased in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and euro.

The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, increased by 1.1 points and 0.5 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, decreased by 0.6 points in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower losses in a warranty retail program and A&H, partially offset by an increase in losses in automobile and property businesses. In addition, severe losses represented 0.2 points and 0.7 points of the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower loss ratio associated with the warranty service program was largely offset by an increase in the related profit sharing arrangement, which contributed to the increase in the acquisition ratio in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The acquisition ratio increased by 1.0 point and 0.8 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in acquisition costs in warranty service programs, automobile and property businesses, partially offset by lower A&H direct marketing expenses.  The general operating expense ratio increased by 0.7 points and 0.3 points in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the combined impact of higher employee-related expenses and the timing of technology-related initiatives.    CORPORATE AND OTHER         As a result of the progress of the wind down and de-risking activities of the DIB and the derivative portfolio of AIGFP included within GCM, AIG has discontinued separate reporting of the DIB and GCM. Their results are reported within Income from other assets, net, beginning with the first quarter of 2015. This reporting aligns with the manner in which AIG manages its financial resources.

(b) During the first quarter of 2015, Non-Life Insurance Companies sold a portion of their investment in PICC P&C to AIG Parent. During 2014, the Life Insurance Companies sold their investment in PICC Group to AIG Parent. (c) Consists of the results of investments held by AIG Parent to support various corporate needs as well as the remaining positions of AIGFP, life settlements, real estate, equipment leasing and lending and other secured lending investments held by AIG Parent and certain subsidiaries.   Corporate and Other Quarterly Results Corporate and Other’s pre‑tax operating results improved in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income through the date of sale of most of our AerCap common shares in the second quarter of 2015, which was accounted for under the equity method, fair value gains in our PICC P&C and PICC Group investments and lower interest expense from ongoing debt management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources.  Run-off insurance lines reported pre-tax operating income of $110 million in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to pre-tax operating loss of $53 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to a higher excess workers’ compensation net loss reserve discount benefit, primarily reflecting an increase in Treasury rates from the first quarter of 2015. See Insurance Reserves – Non-Life Insurance Companies – Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. Corporate and Other Year-to-Date Results Corporate and Other’s pre‑tax operating results improved in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to our share of AerCap’s pre-tax operating income through the date of sale of most of our AerCap common shares in the second quarter of 2015, which was accounted for under the equity method, fair value gains in our PICC P&C and PICC Group investments and lower interest expense from ongoing debt management activities described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Run-off insurance lines reported pre-tax operating income of $91 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to pre-tax operating loss of $48 million in the same period in the prior year primarily due to a higher excess workers’ compensation net loss reserve discount benefit, primarily reflecting an increase in Treasury rates from first quarter of 2015.

The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for Non-Life Insurance Companies, Life Insurance Companies and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.    Investments Highlights During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015     • An increase in interest rates and widening of credit spreads resulted in a decrease in our net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2015 from approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014. • We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. • Net investment income benefitted from strong performance on alternative investments, which continued to generate returns higher than our fixed maturity securities portfolio. • Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.  • Other-than-temporary impairments increased due to higher impairments in our equity portfolio; however impairments in our fixed maturity securities portfolio remained at low levels.      Investment Strategies         Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification. Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: • Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Non-Life Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. • Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Non-Life Insurance Companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.  · While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.      129       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      · AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate term investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate term, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.

For the three-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the net investment income recorded on these securities was $(87) million and $54 million, respectively. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the net investment income recorded on these securities was $(43) million and $130 million, respectively. Net investment income decreased for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected, partially offset by higher income on alternative investments. Net investment income decreased for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields, lower income on alternative investments, and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected. Non-Life Insurance Companies         For the Non-Life Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Non-Life Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations. The Non-Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Non-Life Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‑return and tax objectives. In addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio. The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities. With respect to non-affiliate over‑the‑counter derivatives, the Non-Life Insurance Companies conduct business with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. The Non-Life Insurance Companies have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. The Non-Life Insurance Companies generally use ISDA Master Agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures. Fixed maturity investments of the Non-Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an intermediate duration of 4.6 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as      131       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings. Fixed maturity investments held in the Non-Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and short to intermediate duration, averaging 3.3 years. Life Insurance Companies         The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‑liability management and available investment opportunities. The Life Insurance Companies use asset‑liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent possible, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses. The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. The Life Insurance Companies investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities and yield enhancing investments. The Life Insurance Companies monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. The Life Insurance Companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‑force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. Fixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an intermediate duration of 6.4 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‑agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings. Fixed maturity investments held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and intermediate to long duration, averaging 12.8 years. NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities         The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to      132       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of Life Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments – Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings. The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of Life Insurance Companies categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:    June 30, 2015                                                                                 (in millions)                                                                                                                                                 Total                                     Total                                           Below                                     Investment                                           Investment             NAIC Designation       1       2       Grade           3       4       5       6       Grade       Total     Other fixed maturity securities   $   44,256   $   59,694   $   103,950       $   5,104   $   2,508   $   345   $   152   $   8,109   $   112,059     Mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized       40,913       1,867       42,780           370       347       42       836       1,595       44,375     Total*   $   85,169   $   61,561   $   146,730       $   5,474   $   2,855   $   387   $   988   $   9,704   $   156,434    * Excludes $4.3 billion of fixed maturity securities for which no NAIC Designation is available because they are not held in legal entities within Life Insurance Companies that require a statutory filing.

Credit Ratings         At June 30, 2015, approximately 91 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 16 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis. A significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At June 30, 2015, approximately 14 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately six percent were below investment grade or not rated.      133       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      Approximately 44 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Composite AIG Credit Ratings         With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The “Non-rated” category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.  See Enterprise Risk Management herein for a discussion of credit risks associated with Investments.

We recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 related to: • issuer-specific credit events;  • securities that we intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell; • declines due to foreign exchange rates;  • adverse changes in estimated cash flows on certain structured securities; and • securities that experienced severe market valuation declines. In addition, impairments are recorded on real estate and investments in life settlements.     146       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign-exchange related, we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining life of the security. The accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was $180 million and $173 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $368 million and $361 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report for a discussion of our other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy.

Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments          The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the second quarter of 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $4.5 billion due to an increase in interest rates and widening of credit spreads. The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments for the second quarter of 2014 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. Net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities      147       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INVESTMENTS      increased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2014 by $7.7 billion primarily due to the decrease in interest rates and narrowing of spreads.

Gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including estimates for IBNR and loss expenses, less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount. The Non-Life Insurance Companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pre‑tax operating income. Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease prior years’ estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development. Net loss reserves represent gross loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance.     148       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      The following table presents the components of net loss reserves:                            June 30,       December 31,     (in millions)                           2015       2014     Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount                       $   76,251   $   80,337     Less: discount                           (3,312)       (3,077)     Gross loss reserves, net of discount, before reinsurance                           72,939       77,260     Less: reinsurance recoverable*                           (13,846)       (15,648)     Net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses                       $   59,093   $   61,612    * Includes $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of reinsurance recoverable under a retroactive reinsurance agreement at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $12.3 billion and $12.4 billion at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (in excess of high dollar amounts retained by the insured through self-insured retentions, deductibles, retrospective programs, or captive arrangements; each referred to generically as “deductibles”), primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business, where the Non-Life Insurance Companies manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Non-Life Insurance Companies held collateral totaling $9.7 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and assets in trusts.

New York rules generally do not permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves. Pennsylvania permits non-tabular discounting of IBNR and, commencing in 2013, approved variable discount rates determined using risk-free rates based on the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin, applicable to IBNR and case reserves. Delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the Pennsylvania domiciled companies. The net increase in workers’ compensation discount in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 of $401 million and $237 million, respectively, was primarily due to the increase in the referenced U.S. Treasury forward yield curve rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices. The increase in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a $403 million and $283 million increase in the loss reserve discount, as Treasury rates generally increased along the payout pattern horizon in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively. In addition, the effects of the discount attributable to newly established reserves for accident year 2015 increased the discount by $58 million and $104 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a $60 million and $150 million reduction for accident years 2014 and prior, primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively.  On January 1, 2014, the Non-Life Insurance Companies merged their two internal pooling arrangements into one pool, and changed the participation percentages of the pool members resulting in a reallocation of reserves from New York domiciled companies to those domiciled in Pennsylvania and Delaware. As a result of these changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool, the Non-Life Insurance Companies recognized a discount benefit of $110 million in the first quarter of 2014. Quarterly Reserving Conclusion         AIG net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of June 30, 2015. While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of June 30, 2015. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our      150       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.

For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a large change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, the adverse prior year loss reserve development was $317 million and $341 million, respectively, which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in Excess and Primary Casualty, as well as adverse development from Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and prior), and Run-off Environmental (1987 to 2004). This was partially offset by Property excluding natural catastrophes, both domestically and internationally. We have observed increases in both the frequency and severity of claims occurring in our primary and excess commercial automobile liability business since the recovery from the recent economic downturn, which have significantly outpaced the rate increases implemented during the same time. We believe a combination of factors are contributing to these increases such as a mix of business weighted towards Excess auto liability for commercial trucking; increased shipping activity potentially resulting in driver fatigue, a greater incidence of claims involving multiple severe injuries and fatalities and the general increase in damage awards.  We continue to react to these trends as new information emerges, including strengthening reserves during the annual detailed valuation review (DVR) of the commercial automobile liability business in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and through our selection of the current accident year loss ratios. In addition, we made interim increases to reserves in periods between the annual DVR in 2014 and 2015. The experience in accident years 2011 and subsequent has continued to deteriorate and the DVR conducted in the current quarter resulted in an increase of commercial automobile liability reserves by $285 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, primarily in accident years 2011 through 2014. This increase included $74 million for primary automobile and $211 million for excess automobile for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $402 million of adverse prior year loss development on commercial automobile liability business, including $91 million for primary automobile and $311 million for excess automobile.     152       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      The adverse prior year development in Run-off is driven by the annual reserve review of the Asbestos and Environmental (1986 and prior) and a reduction of the reinsurance recoverable on the Run-off Environmental (1987 to 2004). We recognized return premiums on loss sensitive business of $12 million and $(68) million for the three-month periods ended June 30, of 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $23 million and $(64) million for the six-month periods ended June 30, of 2015 and 2014, respectively, which entirely offset favorable development in that business.

As described more fully in the 2014 Annual Report, our reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive ground‑up and top-down analyses performed periodically. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, we increased our gross asbestos reserves by $14 million and our net asbestos reserves by $6 million due to minor changes in estimates, accretion of discount, and anticipated uncollectible reinsurance. For the same period, AIG increased its gross environmental reserves by $66 million and its net environmental reserves by $43 million to reflect the results of a top-down analysis of accident years 2004 and prior completed in the second quarter of 2015. In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, the Non-Life Insurance Companies also have asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non‑U.S. entities of $124 million gross and $98 million net as of June 30, 2015. The asbestos reserves relating to non‑U.S. risks written by non‑U.S. entities were $132 million gross and $105 million net as of December 31, 2014.

Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves         The following section provides discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance reserves for Life Insurance Companies. DAC The following table summarizes the major components of the changes in Life Insurance Companies DAC, including VOBA:    Six Months Ended June 30,                             (in millions)               2015       2014     Balance, beginning of year           $   7,258   $   6,920     Acquisition costs deferred               596       537     Amortization expense:                             Related to realized capital gains and losses               (64)       (9)     All other operating amortization               (476)       (406)     Increase (decrease) in DAC due to foreign exchange               (19)       (10)     Change related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments               363       (613)     Balance, end of period*           $   7,658   $   6,419    * DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments was $8.7 billion and $8.1 billion at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing contracts for investment-oriented products are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.       155       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / INSURANCE RESERVES / LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES      DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). The change in shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio. In addition, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). Market interest rates increased in the three-month period ended June 30, 2015, the first quarterly increase since 2013. As a result, the Life Insurance Companies’ unrealized appreciation of investments in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 decreased by $3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2014, which resulted in an increase in shadow DAC and a decrease in shadow loss reserves. Shadow loss reserves were $331 million at June 30, 2015 compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014.

It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets.

Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.  We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited, to repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.        158       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES         Liquidity and Capital Resources Activity for the Six-Month Period Ended June 30, 2015     Sources · AIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries During the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, AIG Parent received $4.7 billion in dividends and loan repayments from subsidiaries.

The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses. Interest payments totaled $0.8 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.7 billion in the same period in the prior year. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $1.3 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 and $3.4 billion for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014. Cash used in operating activities of our Non-Life Insurance Companies in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was $0.6 billion compared to $0.1 billion of cash provided in the same period of the prior year, primarily attributable to increases in loss payments in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities of our Life Insurance Companies was $0.9 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, compared to cash provided of $1.4 billion in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a net decrease in other liabilities, partially offset by higher net income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015. Investing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash provided by investing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included: • approximately $0.2 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by our Life Insurance Companies; and • approximately $3.7 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of AerCap. Net cash provided by investing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2014 included: • approximately $1.0 billion of cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program launched during 2012 by our Life Insurance Companies; and • approximately $2.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ILFC.     161       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Financing Cash Flow Activities         Net cash used in financing activities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 included: • approximately $335 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2015; • approximately $3.7 billion to repurchase approximately 69 million shares of AIG Common Stock; and • approximately $3.7 billion to repay long-term debt. Net cash used in financing activities for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014 included: • approximately $361 million in the aggregate to pay a dividend of $0.125 per share on AIG Common Stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2014; • approximately $1.9 billion to repurchase approximately 36 million shares of AIG Common Stock; • approximately $271 million to repay long-term debt of business held-for-sale; and • approximately $5.8 billion to repay long-term debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries         AIG Parent         As of June 30, 2015, AIG Parent had approximately $18.1 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity sources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs. We generally manage capital flows between AIG Parent and its subsidiaries through internal, Board‑approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.  We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that capital associated      162       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      with businesses or investments that do not directly support our insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.  In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the capital resources available to support our insurance operations and business strategies, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, expectations for capital generation, rating agency expectations for capital, as well as regulatory standards for capital and capital distributions. The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:        As of    As of      (In millions)   June 30, 2015   December 31, 2014     Cash and short-term investments(a)   $   7,669   $   5,085     Unencumbered fixed maturity securities(b)       5,892       4,727     Total AIG Parent liquidity       13,561       9,812     Available capacity under syndicated credit facility(c)       4,000       4,000     Available capacity under contingent liquidity facility(d)       500       500     Total AIG Parent liquidity sources   $   18,061   $   14,312    (a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $5.6 billion and $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  (b) Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. (c) For additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see Credit Facilities below. (d) For additional information relating to the contingent liquidity facility, see Contingent Liquidity Facilities below. Non-Life Insurance Companies         We expect that our Non-Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Certain Non-Life Insurance Companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs may be used to supplement liquidity. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, none of our Non-Life Insurance Companies had FHLB borrowings outstanding.  Our Non-Life Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‑renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. On April 30, 2015, AIG Parent and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL), a Non-Life Insurance Company, entered into a new $725 million letter of credit facility, which replaced the prior $625 million letter of credit facility. ACNL, as a member of the Lloyd’s of London insurance syndicate (Lloyd’s), is required to hold capital at Lloyd’s, known as Funds at Lloyds (FAL). Under the new facility, the entire FAL capital requirement of $625 million as of June 30, 2015, which supports the 2015, 2016 and 2017 years of account, was satisfied with a letter of credit in that amount issued under the facility.     163       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Non-Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with a Mortgage Guaranty insurance company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to its board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of June 30, 2015, the minimum required capital for the CMA with the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 19 to 1.  In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $1.3 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent, of which $600 million represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our Non-Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. In addition, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid other non-cash dividends of $299 million to AIG Parent. Life Insurance Companies         We expect that our Life Insurance Companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our Life Insurance Companies hold liquidity resources in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.  Certain of our domestic Life Insurance Companies are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our domestic Life Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of $27 million and $44 million as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a potential liquidity requirement for our Life Insurance Companies. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio. Our Life Insurance Companies also have developed a contingent liquidity plan to address unforeseen liquidity needs. Certain of our domestic Life Insurance Companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these domestic Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. At June 30, 2015, our domestic Life Insurance Companies had $843 million of securities subject to these agreements and $873 million of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received. Our domestic Life Insurance Companies had no securities subject to lending agreements and no collateral liability at December 31, 2014. AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our Life Insurance Companies through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent is party to a CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of AGC Life Insurance Company at or above a specified      164       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      minimum percentage of its projected NAIC Company Action Level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). As of June 30, 2015, the specified minimum percentage under this CMA was 250 percent. Dividends and loan repayments from our domestic Life Insurance Companies to AIG Parent in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 totaled $3.3 billion, which was comprised of cash and fixed maturity securities, of which $2.2 billion represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our domestic operating Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014. The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade municipal, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. Credit Facilities         We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Five-Year Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Five-Year Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.0 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2019. As of June 30, 2015, a total of $4.0 billion remains available under the Five-Year Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Five-Year Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Five-Year Facility would restrict our access to the Five-Year Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Five-Year Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  Contingent Liquidity Facilities         AIG Parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to $500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Under this facility, we have the unconditional right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG Parent and the counterparty.  Our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings.      165       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Contractual Obligations         The following table summarizes contractual obligations in total, and by remaining maturity:    June 30, 2015               Payments due by Period              Total       Remainder       2016 -       2018 -                     (in millions)       Payments        of 2015       2017       2019       2020       Thereafter     Insurance operations                                                     Loss reserves   $   76,251   $   11,019   $   26,748   $   13,579   $   4,323   $   20,582     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       225,601       7,133       28,105       25,230       11,715       153,418     Borrowings       706       -       -       -       -       706     Interest payments on borrowings       1,168       27       109       109       54       869     Other long-term obligations       18       3       10       3       2       -     Total   $   303,744   $   18,182   $   54,972   $   38,921   $   16,094   $   175,575     Other                                                      Borrowings(a)   $   25,562   $   5,202   $   2,692   $   3,087   $   1,308   $   13,273     Interest payments on borrowings       15,716       574       2,242       1,770       796       10,334     Other long-term obligations       171       53       7       2       -       109     Total   $   41,449   $   5,829   $   4,941   $   4,859   $   2,104   $   23,716     Consolidated                                                     Loss reserves   $   76,251   $   11,019   $   26,748   $   13,579   $   4,323   $   20,582     Insurance and investment contract liabilities       225,601       7,133       28,105       25,230       11,715       153,418     Borrowings(a)       26,268       5,202       2,692       3,087       1,308       13,979     Interest payments on borrowings       16,884       601       2,351       1,879       850       11,203     Other long-term obligations(b)       189       56       17       5       2       109     Total(c)   $   345,193   $   24,011   $   59,913   $   43,780   $   18,198   $   199,291    (a) In July 2015, we repurchased, through cash tender offers, (i) approximately $142 million aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes issued by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $153 million, and (ii) approximately $3.3 billion of certain senior notes and junior subordinated notes issued or guaranteed by AIG for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.6 billion. Accordingly, in the table above, these instruments are reported as maturing in the remainder of 2015 instead of their original maturity dates. (b) Primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures. (c) Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.      166       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Loss Reserves         Loss reserves relate to our Non-Life Insurance Companies and represent future losses and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our Non-Life Insurance Companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations. Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities         Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life Insurance Companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control. We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that our Life Insurance Companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life Insurance Companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.  Borrowings         Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.      167       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments         The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:    June 30, 2015               Amount of Commitment Expiring              Total Amounts       Remainder       2016 -       2018 -                     (in millions)       Committed        of 2015       2017       2019       2020       Thereafter     Insurance operations                                                     Guarantees:                                                     Standby letters of credit   $   859   $   30   $   166   $   628   $   35   $   -     Guarantees of indebtedness       194       164       30       -       -       -     All other guarantees(a)       3       -       -       1       -       2     Commitments:                                                     Investment commitments(b)       2,434       1,411       524       201       31       267     Commitments to extend credit       2,150       1,053       249       671       78       99     Letters of credit        13       3       10       -       -       -     Total(c)   $   5,653   $   2,661   $   979   $   1,501   $   144   $   368     Other                                                      Guarantees:                                                     Liquidity facilities(d)   $   77   $   -   $   -   $   -   $   -   $   77     Standby letters of credit       214       212       1       1       -       -     All other guarantees        25       -       25       -       -       -     Commitments:                                                     Investment commitments(b)       222       43       28       -       -       151     Commitments to extend credit(e)       501       1       -       500       -       -     Letters of credit       25       25       -       -       -       -     Other commercial commitments(f)       67       18       41       7       1       -     Total(c)   $   1,131   $   299   $   95   $   508   $   1   $   228     Consolidated                                                     Guarantees:                                                     Liquidity facilities(d)   $   77   $   -   $   -   $   -   $   -   $   77     Standby letters of credit       1,073       242       167       629       35       -     Guarantees of indebtedness       194       164       30       -       -       -     All other guarantees(a)       28       -       25       1       -       2     Commitments:                                                     Investment commitments(b)       2,656       1,454       552       201       31       418     Commitments to extend credit(e)       2,651       1,054       249       1,171       78       99     Letters of credit       38       28       10       -       -       -     Other commercial commitments(f)       67       18       41       7       1       -     Total(c)   $   6,784   $   2,960   $   1,074   $   2,009   $   145   $   596    (a) Includes construction guarantees connected to affordable housing investments by our Life Insurance Companies. Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. See Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on indemnification obligations. (b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries. (c) Does not include guarantees, CMAs or other support arrangements among AIG consolidated entities.  (d) Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations. (e) Includes a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent, as lender (the AerCap Credit Facility). The AerCap Credit Facility permits loans for general corporate purposes. In June 2015, upon the receipt by AIG Parent of the $500 million principal amount of 6.50% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes issued by AerCap Global Aviation Trust, the aggregate commitment under the AerCap Credit Facility was reduced to $500 million from $1.0 billion. At June 30, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the AerCap Credit Facility.     168       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      (f) Excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. The remaining annual pension contribution for 2015 is expected to be approximately $65 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Arrangements with Variable Interest Entities          We enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, see Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Agreements         We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.       169       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Debt         The following table provides the rollforward of AIG’s total debt outstanding:            Balance at               Maturities       Effect of                   Balance at     Six Months Ended June 30, 2015       December 31,               and       Foreign       Other       June 30,     (in millions)       2014       Issuances   Repayments       Exchange       Changes           2015     Debt issued or guaranteed by AIG:                                                         AIG general borrowings:                                                         Notes and bonds payable   $   15,570   $   2,342   $   -   $   (70)   $   4       $   17,846     Subordinated debt       250       -       -       -       -           250     Junior subordinated debt       2,466       -       (803)       (37)       -           1,626     Loans and mortgages payable       -       -       -       -       -           -     AIGLH notes and bonds payable       284       -       -       -       -           284     AIGLH junior subordinated debt       536       -       (114)       -       -           422     Total AIG general borrowings       19,106       2,342       (917)       (107)       4           20,428     AIG borrowings supported by assets:(a)                                                         MIP notes payable       2,870       -       (1,211)       (75)       (50)           1,534     Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable       34       -       (2)       -       5           37     GIAs, at fair value       4,648       171       (1,051)       -       (46)   (b)       3,722     Notes and bonds payable, at fair value       818       9       (271)       -       (9)   (b)       547     Total AIG borrowings supported by assets       8,370       180       (2,535)       (75)       (100)           5,840     Total debt issued or guaranteed by AIG       27,476       2,522       (3,452)       (182)       (96)           26,268     Debt not guaranteed by AIG:                                                         Other subsidiaries notes, bonds, loans and                                                         mortgages payable       58       109       (53)       (5)       23           132     Debt of consolidated investments(c)       3,683       226       (288)       (14)       353   (d)       3,960     Total debt not guaranteed by AIG       3,741       335       (341)       (19)       376           4,092     Total debt   $   31,217   $   2,857   $   (3,793)   $   (201)   $   280       $   30,360    (a) AIG Parent guarantees all such debt, except for MIP notes payable and Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable, which are direct obligations of AIG Parent.

Accordingly, in the table above, these instruments are reported as maturing in the remainder of 2015 instead of their original maturity dates.    Credit Ratings         Credit ratings estimate a company’s ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing to that company. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of July 31, 2015. Figures in parentheses indicate the relative ranking of the ratings within the agency’s rating categories; that ranking refers only to the major rating category and not to the modifiers assigned by the rating agencies.

They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request. We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early. The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.  For a discussion of the effects of downgrades in the financial strength ratings of our insurance companies or our credit ratings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity, Capital and Credit in our 2014 Annual Report.  Regulation and Supervision         For a discussion of our regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, including with respect to our liquidity and capital resources, see Item 1.

Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock     On February 12, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on March 26, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2015. On April 30, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on June 25, 2015 to shareholders of record on June 11, 2015. On August 3, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.28 per share, payable on September 28, 2015 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2015. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On August 3, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $5.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization, resulting in an aggregate remaining authorization on such date of approximately $6.3 billion. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us.  During the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased approximately 69 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.7 billion pursuant to this authorization. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 3.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in January 2015 upon the settlement of an ASR      173       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 plan, from July 1 to July 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $965 million of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.  Dividend Restrictions         Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries.      ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT    Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. Overview         We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‑wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firm’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‑taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For a further discussion of AIG’s risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A ─ Enterprise Risk Management in the 2014 Annual Report. Credit Risk Management         Overview         Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads. We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.  We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require      174       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      mitigants, such as third‑party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data.  See Investments – Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures. Market Risk Management         Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.  We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for properly identifying these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).  The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function. Risk Identification         Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital. Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk: Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‑backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, and residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.  Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and resulting product changes will generally reduce the attractiveness of our insurance products in the marketplace. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric U.S. GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.     175       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‑free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the long‑term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit‑worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses. Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.  Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‑traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels. Risk Measurement         Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm‑wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specific stress tests. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis. In addition, we continue to enhance economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital‑based risk measures at the market risk level, business‑unit level and firm‑wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.    We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:     Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in price on equity securities. Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‑looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‑wide equity markets. Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses. Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.        176       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      Market Risk Sensitivities         The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:        Balance Sheet Exposure               Balance Sheet Effect         June 30,       December 31,               June 30,       December 31,      (dollars in millions)       2015           2014                   2015           2014     Sensitivity factor                                    100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves     Interest rate sensitive assets:                                                         Fixed maturity securities       266,299           273,885                   (14,555)           (15,107)     Mortgage and other loans receivable       17,774           16,594                   (984)           (921)     Preferred stock       23           19                   (3)           (1)     Total interest rate sensitive assets   $   284,096   (a)   $   290,498   (a)            $   (15,542)       $   (16,029)     Sensitivity factor                                    20% decline in stock prices and value of                                         alternative investments     Equity and alternative investments exposure:                                                         Hedge funds       11,347           10,798                   (2,269)           (2,160)     Private equity       8,320           8,858                   (1,664)           (1,772)     Real estate investments       4,591           3,612                   (918)           (722)     PICC(b)        3,474           3,375                   (695)           (675)     Common equity       2,091           2,044                   (418)           (409)     Aircraft asset investments       596           651                   (119)           (130)     AerCap(c)        489           4,972                   (98)           (994)     Other investments       686           1,331                   (138)           (266)     Total equity and alternative investments                                                          exposure   $   31,594       $   35,641               $   (6,319)       $   (7,128)     Sensitivity factor                                    10% depreciation of all foreign currency                                          exchange rates against the U.S. dollar     Foreign currency-denominated net                                                          asset position(d)   $   12,148       $   12,005               $   (1,215)       $   (1,201)    (a) At June 30, 2015, the analysis covered $284.1 billion of $303.1 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $9.3 billion of loans, and $3.8 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.9 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2014, the analysis covered $290.4 billion of $308.9 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $8.4 billion of loans, and $3.8 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $6.3 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.  (b) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C. (c) In June 2015, we sold substantially all of our ordinary shares of AerCap. Our 2014 sensitivity calculation for AerCap was based on our carrying value rather than the stock price as of the applicable date, as we applied the equity method of accounting prior to the sale.  (d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‑U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non‑U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries. However, we may utilize either cross-currency swaps or our foreign currency- denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries.  At June 30, 2015, our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in British pounds, Canadian dollars, euro, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese yen. Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at June 30, 2015 increased by $143 million, compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was mostly due to a $1.1 billion increase in our euro position, primarily resulting from debt hedging; a $666 million increase in our Japanese yen position, primarily resulting from debt      177       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT      hedging and unrealized appreciation of investments; and a $254 million increase in our Swiss franc position, primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in our British pound position, primarily resulting from the unwinding of a cross-currency swap, and a $297 million decrease in our Canadian dollar position, primarily resulting from dividend hedging.  For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.  Liquidity Risk Management         Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.  AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due. AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period of up to one year. We maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements. Risk Identification         The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.  • Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.  • Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls. • Event Funding Risk: Additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that created a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.  • Financing Risk: We are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding. Risk Measurement         Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.     178       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT         We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:     Coverage Ratios: Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of a portfolio of assets to meet the forecasted net cash flow over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.  Asset Ratios: Asset Ratios measure and track the quality of an entity’s assets that can be used to raise liquidity over a specified period of time.  Cash Flow Forecasts: Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon. Stress Testing: Coverage Ratios and Asset Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.    Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.    The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:     • income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset; • liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses; • reinsurance assets; • valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition; • valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products; • estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products; • impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on investments in life settlements and goodwill impairment; • liability for legal contingencies; and • fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates, you should read Part II, Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2014 Annual Report.      179       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT           REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT    Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years. AIG is regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) due to its designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a nonbank SIFI. As a nonbank SIFI, AIG is required each year to submit to the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) a plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which must meet several specific requirements, including identifying material entities and core business lines, setting forth a detailed resolution strategy, providing detailed information regarding organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. On March 26, 2015, the FRB and the FDIC permanently adjusted the annual resolution plan filing deadline for designated nonbank SIFIs, including AIG, from July 1 to December 31 of each year beginning in 2016. The agencies previously granted a temporary extension of the 2015 resolution plan deadline for designated nonbank SIFIs, including AIG, from July 1 to December 31, 2015. The FRB has yet to complete the regulatory and capital framework that will be applicable to AIG as a nonbank SIFI. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our regulatory status is also discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business – Regulation, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2014 Annual Report.     180       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY         GLOSSARY      Accident year The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted The combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.  Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs, certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting, and the change in DAC. Acquisition costs that are incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are deferred and recognized over the coverage periods of related insurance contracts. Acquisition costs that are not incremental and directly related to successful sales efforts are recognized as incurred.  Base Spread Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets. Base Yield Net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected. BET Binomial Expansion Technique A model that generates expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derives a credit rating for those tranches. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI and Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI and DTA are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. Book Value Per Common Share Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, by Total common shares outstanding. Book Value Per Share Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing Total AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and DTA, by Total common shares outstanding.  Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result. Catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each. Combined ratio Sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition and general operating expense ratios. CSA Credit Support Annex A legal document generally associated with an ISDA Master Agreement that provides for collateral postings which could vary depending on ratings and threshold levels. CVA  Credit Valuation Adjustment The CVA adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. Also, the CVA reflects the fair value movement in AIGFP's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Finally, the CVA also accounts for our own credit risk, in the fair value measurement of all net derivative liabilities positions and liabilities where AIG has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.  DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. DAC Related to Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments An adjustment to DAC for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (also referred to as “shadow DAC”). The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by      181       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned. First-Lien Priority over all other liens or claims on a property in the event of default on a mortgage.  General operating expense ratio General operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses. GIC/GIA Guaranteed Investment Contract/Guaranteed Investment Agreement A contract whereby the seller provides a guaranteed repayment of principal and a fixed or floating interest rate for a predetermined period of time.

IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. LAE Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. Loss Ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. Loss adjustment expenses are directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees, and claims department personnel costs. Loss reserve development The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserves Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. LTV Loan-to-Value Ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. Net premiums written Represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while Net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are earned, the amount is presented as Unearned premium reserves in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonbank SIFI Nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institutions Financial institutions are deemed nonbank systemically important (that is, the failure of the financial institution could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council based on a three-stage analytical process. Noncontrolling interest The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. Policy fees An amount added to a policy premium, or deducted from a policy cash value or contract holder account, to reflect the cost of issuing a policy, establishing the required records, sending premium notices and other related expenses.     182       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      Pool  A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage. Prior to January 1, 2014, AIG maintained two pools (the admitted lines pool and the surplus lines pool. Our members in the admitted lines pool are licensed to write standard lines of business by the individual state departments of insurance, and the policy forms and rates are regulated by those departments. Our members in the surplus lines pool provide policyholders with insurance coverage for risks which are generally not available in the standard insurance market. Surplus lines policy forms and rates are not regulated by the insurance departments. Effective January 1, 2014, these two pools were merged into one combined pool (the combined pool). Premiums and deposits – Institutional Markets include direct and assumed amounts received and earned on group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities and deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts including GICs. Premiums and deposits – Retirement and  – Life include direct and assumed amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and deposits on life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds. Prior year development Increase (referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening) or decrease (referred to as favorable development) in estimates of losses and loss expenses for prior years that is included in earnings. RBC Risk-Based Capital  A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. Reinstatement premium Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. Rescission Denial of claims and termination of coverage on loans related to fraudulent or undocumented claims, underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms. Retroactive Reinsurance See Deferred Gain on Retroactive Reinsurance. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA are non-GAAP measures and are used to show the rate of return on shareholders’ equity. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI. Return on Equity – After-tax Operating Income Excluding AOCI and DTA is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to AIG by average AIG shareholders’ equity, excluding average AOCI and DTA.

SIA Sales Inducement Asset Represents amounts that are credited to policyholder account balances related to the enhanced crediting rates that a seller offers on certain of its annuity products. Solvency II  Legislation in the European Union which reforms the insurance industry’s solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC), was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective on January 1, 2016. Subrogation The amount of recovery for claims we have paid our policyholders, generally from a negligent third party or such party’s insurer.  Surrender charge A charge levied against an investor for the early withdrawal of funds from a life insurance or annuity contract, or for the cancellation of the agreement.  Surrender rate represents annualized surrenders and withdrawals as a percentage of average account value. Unearned premium reserve Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect unearned premiums which are usually refundable to policyholders if an insurance or reinsurance contract is canceled prior to expiration of the contract term.     183       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / GLOSSARY      VOBA Value of Business Acquired Present value of projected future gross profits from in-force policies from acquired businesses.      184       TABLE OF CONTENTS    Item 2 / ACRONYMS         ACRONYMS           A&H Accident and Health Insurance   GMIB Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits      ABS Asset-Backed Securities   GMWB  Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits      CDO Collateralized Debt Obligations   ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

Item 4. / Controls and Procedures         Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2015. There has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.      186     TABLE OF CONTENTS           PART II – OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1 / Legal Proceedings         For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
