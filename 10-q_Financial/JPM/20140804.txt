(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, see Note 24.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2013 Annual Report”).Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the balance sheet when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, see Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Consolidated statements of cash flowsDuring the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from available-for-sale (“AFS”) to held-to-maturity (“HTM”). This transfer was a non-cash transaction. For additional information regarding this transaction, see Note 11.Note 2 – Business changes and developments Business eventsRegulatory UpdateComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2014 capital plan.Basel IIIEffective January 1, 2014, the Firm became subject to Basel III. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Firm and its banking subsidiaries were subject to the capital requirements of Basel I and Basel 2.5. Additionally, the Firm is approved to calculate capital under the Basel III Advanced Approach, in addition to the Basel III Standardized Approach effective April 1, 2014.For further information on the implementation of Basel III, refer to Note 20.Preferred stock issuancesDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Firm issued $3.4 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively, of Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock. For further information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Physical commodities businessesThe Firm continues to execute a business simplification agenda that will allow it to focus on core activities for its core clients and better manage its operational, regulatory, and litigation risks. On March 19, 2014, the Firm announced that it had agreed to sell certain of its physical commodities operations, including its physical oil, gas, power, warehousing facilities and energy transportation operations, to Mercuria Energy Group Limited. The after-tax impact of this transaction is not expected to be material. The sale is subject to normal regulatory approvals and is expected to close before the end of 2014. The Firm remains fully committed to its traditional banking activities in the commodities markets, including financial derivatives and the trading of precious metals, which are not part of the physical commodities operations sale.95Increase in common stock dividendThe Board of Directors increased the Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 per share to $0.40 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July 31, 2014, to shareholders of record on July 3, 2014.

Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.96The following table presents the asset and liabilities reported at fair value as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, by major product category and

obligations of $80.6 billion and $91.5 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included within trading loans were $15.5 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $4.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $6.6 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, market 98approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, see Note 5. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions) when the long and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”).(e)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Therefore, the balances reported in the fair value hierarchy table are gross of any counterparty netting adjustments. However, if the Firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivables and payables balances would be $4.2 billion and $7.6 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.(f)Private equity instruments represent investments within the Corporate/Private Equity line of business. The cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $6.3 billion and $8.0 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(g)Includes investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds that do not have readily determinable fair values. The Firm uses net asset value per share when measuring the fair value of these investments. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the fair values of these investments were $2.2 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, of which $590 million and $899 million, respectively, were classified in level 2, and $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in level 3.Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basisFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2, or from level 2 into level 3.During the three months ended June 30, 2014, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion of equity derivative receivables and payables, respectively, due to increased observability of certain equity options.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, certain highly rated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), including $27.3 billion held in the Firm’s AFS securities portfolio and $1.3 billion held in the trading portfolio, were transferred from level 3 to level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency.All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.Level 3 valuationsFor further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input range does not reflect the level of input uncertainty; instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at June 30, 2014, the equity and interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range presented. In addition, the interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while equity volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range. The forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated within the lower end of the range presented.99Level 3 inputs(a) June 30, 2014 (in millions, except for ratios and basis points)     Product/InstrumentFair value Principal valuation techniqueUnobservable inputsRange of input valuesWeighted averageResidential mortgage-backed securities and loans$9,931 Discounted cash flowsYield2 %-15%6%   Prepayment speed0 %-21%6%    Conditional default rate0 %-100%29%    Loss severity0 %-100%22%Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(b)2,500 Discounted cash flowsYield3 %-28%15%   Conditional default rate0 %-100%10%    Loss severity0 %-40%35%Corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, and other(c)16,933 Discounted cash flowsCredit spread53 bps-365 bps167 bps   Yield1 %-43%9%4,078 Market comparablesPrice—-12094Net interest rate derivatives1,533 Option pricingInterest rate correlation(75)%-97%     Interest rate spread volatility0 %-60% Net credit derivatives(b)(c)134 Discounted cash flowsCredit correlation44 %-86% Net foreign exchange derivatives(1,194) Option pricingForeign exchange correlation48 %-75% Net equity derivatives(2,206) Option pricingEquity volatility20 %-50% Net commodity derivatives(122) Discounted cash flowsForward commodity price$20-$160per megawatt hourCollateralized loan obligations798 Discounted cash flowsCredit spread240 bps-500 bps252 bps    Prepayment speed20%20%    Conditional default rate2%2%    Loss severity40%40% 379 Market comparablesPrice0-10879Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)8,347 Discounted cash flowsRefer to Note 16.

The estimation of the fair value of structured notes is predominantly based on the derivative features embedded within the instruments. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(e)The range has not been disclosed due to the wide range of possible values given the diverse nature of the underlying investments.100Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.101 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  Three months ended June 30, 2014(in millions)Fair value at April 1, 2014Total realized/unrealized

The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2013, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 107.Three months ended June 30, 2014 Level 3 assets were $60.4 billion at June 30, 2014, reflecting a decrease of $2.8 billion from March 31, 2014, largely due to the following:•$4.9 billion decrease in derivative receivables, largely driven by client-driven market-making activity and a transfer of equity derivative receivables from level 3 to level 2 due to increase in observability of certain equity options;•$2.0 billion increase in loans due to originations;•$1.5 billion increase in trading assets - debt and equity instruments largely driven by trading loans purchases and new client-driven financing transactions;Six months ended June 30, 2014Level 3 assets decreased by $8.9 billion in the first six months of 2014, mainly due to the following:•$6.0 billion decrease in derivative receivable, predominantly driven by equity derivative receivables due to maturities and a transfer from level 3 to level 2 as a result of increase in observability of certain equity options;•$2.3 billion increase in loans due to originations;•$1.6 billion decrease in private equity investments, driven by sales of investments.•$1.4 billion decrease in trading assets - debt and equity instruments, largely driven by net sales and maturities of corporate debt securities.•$1.3 million decrease in MSRs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis At June 30, 2014 and 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $3.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which predominantly consisted of loans that had fair value adjustments in each of the first six months of 2014 and 2013. At June 30, 2014, $597 million and $2.8 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At June 30, 2013, $95 million and $1.5 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at June 30, 2014 and 2013. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $3.4 billion of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $2.1 billion related to trade finance loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale during the fourth quarter of 2013 and subject to a lower of cost or fair value adjustment. These loans were classified as level 3, as they are valued based on the indicative pricing received from external investors, which ranged from a spread of 58 bps to 70 bps, with a weighted average of 62 bps.At June 30, 2014, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis also included $542 million related to residential real estate loans measured at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 12% to 64%, with a weighted average of 29%.The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $318 million and $293 million, respectively; and for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, was a reduction of $456 million and $521 million.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.107Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair valueThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see Valuation hierarchy on pages 197–215 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and pages 96–109 of this Note.(c)Current period numbers have been updated to include certain nonmarketable equity securities. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation.(d)Carrying value includes unamortized original issue discount and other valuation adjustments.108The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm’s wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflected as the remaining contractual principal is the final principal payment at maturity.At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(106) million and $(99) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report, and Note 21 of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe table below presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk to which the structured notes’ embedded derivative relates.

For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge  accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.Type of DerivativeUse of DerivativeDesignation and disclosureAffected segment or unit10-Q page referenceManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:   ◦ Interest rateHedge fixed rate assets and liabilitiesFair value hedgeCorporate/PE119-120◦ Interest rateHedge floating rate assets and liabilitiesCash flow hedgeCorporate/PE121◦ Foreign exchange Hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilitiesFair value hedgeCorporate/PE119-120◦ Foreign exchange Hedge forecasted revenue and expenseCash flow hedgeCorporate/PE121◦ Foreign exchange Hedge the value of the Firm’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiariesNet investment hedgeCorporate/PE122◦ Commodity Hedge commodity inventoryFair value hedgeCIB119-120Manage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:   ◦ Interest rateManage the risk of the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRsSpecified risk managementCCB122◦ CreditManage the credit risk of wholesale lending exposuresSpecified risk managementCIB122◦ CommodityManage the risk of certain commodities-related contracts and investmentsSpecified risk managementCIB122◦ Interest rate and foreign exchangeManage the risk of certain other specified assets and liabilitiesSpecified risk managementCorporate/PE122Market-making derivatives and other activities:   ◦ VariousMarket-making and related risk managementMarket-making and otherCIB122◦ VariousOther derivativesMarket-making and otherCIB, Corporate/PE122113Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.114Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.Free-standing derivative receivables and payables(a)       Gross derivative receivables  Gross derivative payables June 30, 2014(in millions)Not designated as hedgesDesignated as hedgesTotal derivative receivablesNet derivative receivables(b) Not designated as hedgesDesignated as hedgesTotal derivative payablesNet derivative payables(b)Trading assets and liabilities         Interest rate$817,201$3,100$820,301$28,829 $784,808$2,410$787,218$15,089Credit81,052—81,0522,964 79,556—79,5562,832Foreign exchange112,2431,008113,25111,625 113,3571,327114,68411,682Equity49,794—49,7949,377 53,524—53,52411,024Commodity35,84328336,1269,583 36,18168036,86110,168Total fair value of trading assets and liabilities$1,096,133$4,391$1,100,524$62,378 $1,067,426$4,417$1,071,843$50,795           Gross derivative receivables  Gross derivative payables December 31, 2013 (in millions)Not designated as hedgesDesignated as hedgesTotal derivative receivablesNet derivative receivables(b) Not designated as hedgesDesignated as hedgesTotal derivative payablesNet derivative payables(b)Trading assets and liabilities         Interest rate$851,189$3,490$854,679$25,782 $820,811$4,543$825,354$13,283Credit83,520—83,5201,516 82,402—82,4022,281Foreign exchange152,2401,359153,59916,790 158,7281,397160,12515,947Equity52,931—52,93112,227 54,654—54,65414,719Commodity34,3441,39435,7389,444 37,605937,61411,084Total fair value of trading assets and liabilities$1,174,224$6,243$1,180,467$65,759 $1,154,200$5,949$1,160,149$57,314(a)Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected.

Derivative receivables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative payables and cash collateral payables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the receivables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.

These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is comprised of  non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained. The following tables present information regarding certain financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the derivative instruments for which appropriate legal opinions have been obtained; excluded are (i) additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and (ii) all collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.

Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or termination payment requirements.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. The current presentation excludes accrued interest.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to changes in foreign currency rates, were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(c)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(d)The prior period amounts have been revised.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.(c)The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.(d)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $71 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) at June 30, 2014, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 9 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.121Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no material ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.            Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.

These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(c)Primarily relates to hedges of the foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(d)Primarily relates to commodity derivatives used to mitigate energy price risk associated with energy-related contracts and investments. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm’s market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. 122Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes Maximum payout/Notional amount June 30, 2014 (in millions)Protection soldProtection purchased with identical underlyings(c)Net protection (sold)/purchased(d) Other protection purchased(e) Credit derivatives       Credit default swaps$(2,370,387) $2,573,221$202,834 $19,406 Other credit derivatives(a)(63,840) 48,135(15,705) 24,692 Total credit derivatives(2,434,227) 2,621,356187,129 44,098 Credit-related notes(114) —(114) 2,892 Total$(2,434,341) $2,621,356$187,015 $46,990          Maximum payout/Notional amount December 31, 2013 (in millions)Protection soldProtection purchased with identical underlyings(c)Net protection (sold)/purchased(d) Other protection purchased(e) Credit derivatives       Credit default swaps$(2,601,581) $2,610,198$8,617 $8,722 Other credit derivatives(a)(44,137)(b) 45,9211,784(b) 20,480(b) Total credit derivatives(2,645,718) 2,656,11910,401 29,202 Credit-related notes(130) —(130) 2,720 Total$(2,645,848) $2,656,119$10,271 $31,922 (a)Other credit derivatives predominantly consists of credit swap options.(b)The prior period amounts have been revised. This revision had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or its results of operations.(c)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.(d)Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.(e)Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings and maturity profile, and the total fair value, of credit derivatives as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.Protection sold – credit derivatives and credit-related notes ratings(a)/maturity profile    June 30, 2014 (in millions)<1 year 1–5 years >5 years Total notional amount Fair value of receivables(c) Fair value of payables(c) Net fair value Risk rating of reference entity              Investment-grade$(416,698) $(1,280,933) $(94,729) $(1,792,360) $33,363 $(2,403) $30,960 Noninvestment-grade(150,449) (463,834) (27,698) (641,981) 26,967 (14,775) 12,192 Total$(567,147) $(1,744,767) $(122,427) $(2,434,341) $60,330 $(17,178) $43,152 December 31, 2013 (in millions)<1 year 1–5 years >5 years Total notional amount Fair value of receivables(c) Fair value of payables(c) Net fair value Risk rating of reference entity              Investment-grade$(368,712)(b) $(1,469,773)(b) $(93,209)(b) $(1,931,694)(b) $31,730(b) $(5,664)(b) $26,066(b) Noninvestment-grade(140,540) (544,671) (28,943) (714,154) 27,426 (16,674) 10,752 Total$(509,252) $(2,014,444) $(122,152) $(2,645,848) $59,156 $(22,338) $36,818 (a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.(b)The prior period amounts have been revised.

Securities classified as trading are discussed in Note 3. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM investment securities (the “investment securities portfolio”) are held by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (“CIO”) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax unrealized losses of $9 million on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect the Firm’s intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures under Basel III. Realized gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (“OTTI”) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.

Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,(in millions)20142013 20142013Balance, beginning of period$1$519 $1$522Reductions:     Sales and redemptions of credit-impaired securities—— —(3)Balance, end of period$1$519 $1$519Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally decreased since December 31, 2013. Though losses on securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have increased, the increase is not material. The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of June 30, 2014, the Firm does not intend to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities noted above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities in an unrealized loss position are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2014.   130Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at June 30, 2014, of JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.By remaining maturityJune 30, 2014(in millions)Due in one year or lessDue after one year through five yearsDue after five years through 10 yearsDue after 10 years(c)TotalAvailable-for-sale debt securities     Mortgage-backed securities(a)     Amortized cost$677$18,314$9,278$108,668$136,937Fair value68318,8119,538112,132141,164Average yield(b)2.50%1.69%2.67%3.07%2.86%U.S. Treasury and government agencies(a)     Amortized cost$12,418$3,998$1,887$976$19,279Fair value12,4304,0071,8901,03219,359Average yield(b)0.27%0.51%0.30%0.72%0.34%Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities     Amortized cost$60$467$1,407$24,546$26,480Fair value604911,46726,06828,086Average yield(b)2.61%4.40%4.28%6.82%6.63%Certificates of deposit     Amortized cost$1,359$52$—$—$1,411Fair value1,35753——1,410Average yield(b)2.67%3.28%—%—%2.69%Non-U.S. government debt securities     Amortized cost$11,946$15,186$25,380$4,215$56,727Fair value11,97615,41926,0664,38457,845Average yield(b)3.52%2.51%1.25%1.20%2.06%Corporate debt securities     Amortized cost$3,692$10,843$6,244$—$20,779Fair value3,70711,1396,510—21,356Average yield(b)2.15%2.35%2.47%—%2.35%Asset-backed securities     Amortized cost$15$3,382$17,523$20,269$41,189Fair value153,40817,65320,48241,558Average yield(b)2.15%2.10%1.79%1.80%1.82%Total available-for-sale debt securities     Amortized cost$30,167$52,242$61,719$158,674$302,802Fair value30,22853,32863,124164,098310,778Average yield(b)1.95%2.02%1.78%3.42%2.70%Available-for-sale equity securities     Amortized cost$—$—$—$3,278$3,278Fair value———3,2913,291Average yield(b)—%—%—%0.18%0.18%Total available-for-sale securities     Amortized cost$30,167$52,242$61,719$161,952$306,080Fair value30,22853,32863,124167,389314,069Average yield(b)1.95%2.02%1.78%3.36%2.67%Total held-to-maturity securities     Amortized cost$—$56$346$47,447$47,849Fair value—5635848,74949,163Average yield(b)—%4.28%4.75%3.91%3.92%(a)U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were the only issuers whose securities exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2014.(b)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)Includes securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately six years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, three years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and four years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 131Note 12 – Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below.

As a result a net exposure amount is reported even though the Firm, on an aggregate basis for its securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, has received securities collateral with a total fair value that is greater than the funds provided to counterparties.(b)Includes financial instrument collateral received, repurchase liabilities and securities loaned liabilities with an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement; these amounts are not presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because other U.S. GAAP netting criteria are not met.132The following table presents as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned.

These transfers have been  recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets, other assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, and accounts payable and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.133Note 13 – LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans•Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair value•PCI loans held-for-investment For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. See Note 4 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(c)Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Home equity – senior lien• Home equity – junior lien• Prime mortgage, including  option ARMs• Subprime mortgageOther consumer loans• Auto(b)• Business banking(b)• Student and otherResidential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other(d)(a)Includes loans held in CCB, and prime mortgage loans held in the AM business segment and in Corporate/Private Equity.(b)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB and AM business segments and in Corporate/Private Equity. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.(d)Other primarily includes loans to special-purpose entities (“SPEs”) and loans to private banking clients.

The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.(in millions)June 30, 2014December 31, 2013Residential real estate –  excluding PCI  Home equity:  Senior lien$16,222$17,113Junior lien38,26340,750Mortgages:  Prime, including option ARMs93,23987,162Subprime6,5527,104Other consumer loans  Auto53,04252,757Business banking19,45318,951Student and other11,32511,557Residential real estate – PCI  Home equity18,07018,927Prime mortgage11,30212,038Subprime mortgage3,9474,175Option ARMs16,79917,915Total retained loans$288,214$288,449For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Residential real estate – excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate – excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm’s residential real estate – excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.136Residential real estate – excluding PCI loans                    Home equity Mortgages   (in millions, except ratios)Senior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime Total residential real estate – excluding PCIJun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013Loan delinquency(a)              Current$15,630$16,470 $37,503$39,864 $82,780$76,108 $5,618$5,956 $141,531$138,39830–149 days past due251298 526662 3,4663,155 569646 4,8124,761150 or more days past due341345 234224 6,9937,899 365502 7,9338,970Total retained loans$16,222$17,113 $38,263$40,750 $93,239$87,162 $6,552$7,104 $154,276$152,129% of 30+ days past due to  total retained loans(b)3.65%3.76% 1.99%2.17% 1.75%2.32% 14.26%16.16% 2.54%3.09%90 or more days past due and  still accruing$—$— $—$— $—$— $—$— $—$—90 or more days past due and  government guaranteed(c)—— —— 7,3267,823 —— 7,3267,823Nonaccrual loans909932 1,6711,876 2,4552,666 1,2731,390 6,3086,864Current estimated LTV ratios(d)(e)(f)              Greater than 125% and refreshed  FICO scores:              Equal to or greater than 660$22$40 $628$1,101 $954$1,084 $22$52 $1,626$2,277Less than 6601222 192346 181303 102197 487868101% to 125% and refreshed  FICO scores:              Equal to or greater than 660150212 3,5104,645 9321,433 176249 4,7686,539Less than 66074107 1,0121,407 451687 428597 1,9652,79880% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:              Equal to or greater than 660654858 7,1657,995 3,8004,528 545614 12,16413,995Less than 660258326 1,9242,128 1,2431,579 9761,141 4,4015,174Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:              Equal to or greater than 66012,79413,186 20,35719,732 66,92858,477 2,0111,961 102,09093,356Less than 6602,2582,362 3,4753,396 5,2865,359 2,2922,293 13,31113,410U.S. government-guaranteed—— —— 13,46413,712 —— 13,46413,712Total retained loans$16,222$17,113 $38,263$40,750 $93,239$87,162 $6,552$7,104 $154,276$152,129Geographic region              California$2,286$2,397 $8,680$9,240 $24,057$21,876 $994$1,069 $36,017$34,582New York2,6362,732 7,9878,429 14,97614,085 867942 26,46626,188Illinois1,1991,248 2,6552,815 5,6995,216 257280 9,8109,559Florida806847 2,0292,167 4,7784,598 825885 8,4388,497Texas1,8752,044 1,1061,199 4,0413,565 202220 7,2247,028New Jersey609630 2,3232,442 2,8782,679 306339 6,1166,090Arizona9571,019 1,7041,827 1,5251,385 135144 4,3214,375Washington531555 1,3001,378 2,0841,951 138150 4,0534,034Michigan757799 907976 1,061998 165178 2,8902,951Ohio1,2191,298 832907 509466 147161 2,7072,832All other(g)3,3473,544 8,7409,370 31,63130,343 2,5162,736 46,23445,993Total retained loans$16,222$17,113 $38,263$40,750 $93,239$87,162 $6,552$7,104 $154,276$152,129(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion; 30–149 days past due included $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion; and 150 or more days past due included $6.0 billion and $6.6 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(b)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, Prime, including option ARMs loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.8 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.(c)These balances, which are 90 days or more past due but insured by U.S. government agencies, are excluded from nonaccrual loans. In predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, these balances included $4.3 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest because interest has been curtailed by the U.S. government agencies although, in predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal is still insured. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate.(d)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates.(e)Junior lien represents combined LTV, which considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(f)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(g)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively.137The following tables represent the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options  available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm’s delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status.(b)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, $6.7 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.(c)Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S.(d)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs; and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.(e)As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, nonaccrual loans included $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.138The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Three months ended June 30,Average impaired loans Interest income onimpaired loans(a) Interest income on impaired loans on a cash basis(a)(in millions)20142013 20142013 20142013Home equity        Senior lien$1,128$1,158 $14$14 $10$10Junior lien1,3161,296 2021 1314Mortgages        Prime, including option ARMs6,8237,219 6670 1415Subprime3,5783,833 4750 1314Total residential real estate – excluding PCI$12,845$13,506 $147$155 $50$53         Six months ended June 30,Average impaired loans Interest income onimpaired loans(a) Interest income on impaired loans on a cash basis(a)(in millions)20142013 20142013 20142013Home equity        Senior lien$1,135$1,149 $28$29 $19$20Junior lien1,3181,284 4141 2727Mortgages        Prime, including option ARMs6,8897,203 134139 2729Subprime3,6233,830 96100 2629Total residential real estate – excluding PCI$12,965$13,466 $299$309 $99$105(a)Generally, interest income on loans modified in TDRs is recognized on a cash basis until such time as the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms.Loan modificationsThe Firm is required to provide “borrower relief” under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This “borrower relief” includes reductions of principal and forbearance. For further information on these Consent Orders and settlements, see Business changes and developments in Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs.

These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At June 30, 2014, there were approximately 35,200 of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 8,300 senior lien home equity loans, 21,200 junior lien home equity loans, 2,900 prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 2,800 subprime mortgages.Three months ended June 30,Home equity Mortgages Total residentialreal estate - excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Number of loans approved for a trial modification218562 157172 261856 5291,123 1,1652,713Number of loans permanently modified226405 6991,353 3861,137 4931,458 1,8044,353Concession granted:(a)              Interest rate reduction64%70% 88%85% 65%73% 68%72% 75%76%Term or payment extension8673 8376 7969 7153 7966Principal and/or interest deferred1211 2225 3029 1512 2020Principal forgiveness3037 2933 2239 3546 2939Other(b)—— —— 1824 913 611               Six months ended June 30,Home equity Mortgages Total residentialreal estate - excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Number of loans approved for a trial modification4191,062 341368 5161,832 1,0282,612 2,3045,874Number of loans permanently modified521950 1,6572,669 9172,613 1,2603,147 4,3559,379Concession granted:(a)              Interest rate reduction65%72% 86%88% 62%74% 63%71% 72%77%Term or payment extension8373 8377 8469 7251 8066Principal and/or interest deferred1410 2224 3228 1811 2219Principal forgiveness3038 2836 2740 3852 3143Other(b)—— —— 1724 1215 712(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.142Approximately 85% of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”) program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At June 30, 2014, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months, are 18% for senior lien home equity, 20% for junior lien home equity, 15% for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 27% for subprime mortgages. Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge. Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10% and 40% in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At June 30, 2014, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 18% of senior lien home equity, 11% of junior lien home equity, 28% of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 18% of subprime mortgages that were 30 days or more past due.At June 30, 2014, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6 years for senior lien home equity, 7 years for junior lien home equity, 9 years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8 years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).143Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.(in millions, except ratios)Auto Business banking Student and other Total other consumer Jun 30, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Loan delinquency(a)               Current$52,549 $52,152 $19,097$18,511 $10,411 $10,529 $82,057 $81,192 30–119 days past due489 599 204280 621 660 1,314 1,539 120 or more days past due4 6 152160 293 368 449 534 Total retained loans$53,042 $52,757 $19,453$18,951 $11,325 $11,557 $83,820 $83,265 % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans0.93% 1.15% 1.83%2.32% 2.51%(d) 2.52%(d) 1.35%(d) 1.60%(d) 90 or more days past due and still accruing (b)$— $— $—$— $316 $428 $316 $428 Nonaccrual loans103 161 326385 170 86 599 632 Geographic region               California$5,957 $5,615 $2,740$2,374 $1,124 $1,112 $9,821 $9,101 New York3,689 3,898 3,1283,084 1,248 1,218 8,065 8,200 Illinois2,966 2,917 1,2961,341 750 740 5,012 4,998 Florida2,094 2,012 708646 536 539 3,338 3,197 Texas5,310 5,310 2,5922,646 870 878 8,772 8,834 New Jersey1,942 2,014 407392 390 397 2,739 2,803 Arizona1,949 1,855 9811,046 253 252 3,183 3,153 Washington1,001 950 238234 235 227 1,474 1,411 Michigan1,771 1,902 1,3631,383 489 513 3,623 3,798 Ohio2,148 2,229 1,3041,316 670 708 4,122 4,253 All other24,215 24,055 4,6964,489 4,760 4,973 33,671 33,517 Total retained loans$53,042 $52,757 $19,453$18,951 $11,325 $11,557 $83,820 $83,265 Loans by risk ratings(c)               Noncriticized$9,269 $9,968 $14,065$13,622 NA NA $23,334 $23,590 Criticized performing34 54 740711 NA NA 774 765 Criticized nonaccrual— 38 271316 NA NA 271 354 (a)Individual delinquency classifications included loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) as follows: current included $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion; 30-119 days past due included $359 million and $387 million; and 120 or more days past due included $271 million and $350 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(b)These amounts represent student loans, which are insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP.

In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions.The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $7 million and $11 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $14 million and $23 million during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The balance  of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $11 million and $15 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively and $22 million and $28 million during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.In May 2014 the Firm began extending the deferment period for up to 24 months for certain student loans, which resulted in extending the maturity of the loans at their original contractual interest rates. These modified loans are considered TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status.The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans, excluding student loans, for the periods presented.

As a result, an allowance for loan losses for impairment of these pools has been recognized.(c)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(d)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.147Approximately 20% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth  delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, and for the three months ended June 30, 2013, other changes in expected cash flows were driven by changes in prepayment assumptions. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, other changes in expected cash flows were due to refining the expected interest cash flows on HELOCs with balloon payments, partially offset by changes in prepayment assumptions.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.148Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about the Firm’s credit card loans.(in millions, except ratios)June 30, 2014December 31, 2013Loan delinquency  Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing$123,849$125,33530–89 days past due and still accruing9101,10890 or more days past due and still accruing8621,022Nonaccrual loans——Total retained credit card loans$125,621$127,465Loan delinquency ratios  % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans1.41%1.67%% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans0.690.80Credit card loans by geographic region  California$17,040$17,194Texas10,46410,400New York10,42510,497Illinois7,3137,412Florida7,0397,178New Jersey5,5165,554Ohio4,7364,881Pennsylvania4,3474,462Michigan3,5023,618Virginia3,1723,239All other52,06753,030Total retained credit card loans$125,621$127,465Percentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores  Equal to or greater than 66086.2%85.1%Less than 66013.814.9Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans.

The remaining $115 million and $143 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed.(e)Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.

Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60 months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were $193 million and $288 million, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were $426 million and $627 million, respectively.

The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 29.17% and 30.72% for credit card loans modified as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.149Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating  assigned each loan.

For the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was zero and 0.9 years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.8 years and 1.4 years, respectively. There were no wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended June 30, 2014. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended June 30, 2013 was $1 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 1.0 years and 2.1 years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.7 years and 1.6 years, respectively. There were no wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the six months ended June 30, 2014. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $1 million. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.152Note 14 – Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. 2014 2013Six months ended June 30, (in millions)Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card WholesaleTotal Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card WholesaleTotalAllowance for loan losses             Beginning balance at January 1,$8,456 $3,795 $4,013$16,264 12,292 $5,501 $4,143$21,936Gross charge-offs1,084 1,982 773,143 1,458 2,414 1163,988Gross recoveries(399) (209) (108)(716) (394) (318) (148)(860)Net charge-offs/(recoveries)685 1,773 (31)2,427 1,064 2,096 (32)3,128Write-offs of PCI loans(a)109 — —109 — — ——Provision for loan losses81 1,573 (55)1,599 (531) 1,046 64579Other— (1) —(1) (6) (6) 9(3)Ending balance at June 30,$7,743 $3,594 $3,989$15,326 $10,691 $4,445 $4,248$19,384              Allowance for loan losses by impairment methodology             Asset-specific(b)$598 $583(c) $138$1,319 $713 $1,227(c) $228$2,168Formula-based3,396 3,011 3,85110,258 4,267 3,218 4,02011,505PCI3,749 — —3,749 5,711 — —5,711Total allowance for loan losses$7,743 $3,594 $3,989$15,326 $10,691 $4,445 $4,248$19,384              Loans by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$13,191 $2,467 $732$16,390 $14,251 $3,857 $1,032$19,140Formula-based224,905 123,154 320,797668,856 216,401 120,431 307,164643,996PCI50,118 — 550,123 56,736 — 1256,748Total retained loans$288,214 $125,621 $321,534$735,369 $287,388 $124,288 $308,208$719,884              Impaired collateral-dependent loans             Net charge-offs/(recoveries)$81 $— $(5)$76 $132 $— $10$142Loans measured at fair value of collateral less cost to sell3,250 — 3213,571 3,152 — 3943,546              Allowance for lending-related commitments             Beginning balance at January 1,$8 $— $697$705 $7 $— $661$668Provision for lending-related commitments1 — (58)(57) 1 — 8485Other— — —— — — ——Ending balance at June 30,$9 $— $639$648 $8 $— $745$753              Allowance for lending-related commitments by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$— $— $43$43 $— $— $79$79Formula-based9 — 596605 8 — 666674Total allowance for lending-related commitments$9 $— $639$648 $8 $— $745$753              Lending-related commitments by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$— $— $122$122 $— $— $283$283Formula-based56,410 533,688 451,1531,041,251 62,303 532,359 445,1891,039,851Total lending-related commitments$56,410 $533,688 $451,275$1,041,373 $62,303 $532,359 $445,472$1,040,134(a)Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition.

This includes the Firm’s primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 158 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.154The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 159 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities on pages 159–160 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

The Firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.(c)The table above excludes the following: retained servicing (see Note 16 for a discussion of MSRs); securities retained from loans sales to U.S. government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities (See Note 5 for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $105 million and $55 million, respectively, at June 30, 2014, and $151 million and $30 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.(d)Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.(e)As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, 69% of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $437 million and $551 million of investment-grade and $238 million and $260 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion of investment-grade and $124 million and $80 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.155Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 158 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. See the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, The Firm transferred $8.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $264 million and zero, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.During the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, The Firm transferred $13.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $433 million and zero, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm consolidated $83 million and $86 million, respectively, of assets, and $22 million and $23 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 158 of this Note for more information on consolidated re-securitization transactions. As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm held approximately $2.3 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $37 million and $6 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 155 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $7.4 billion and $4.1 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments were not driven by market liquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity, and credit enhancement provided by the Firm to the multi-seller conduits have been eliminated in consolidation. Unfunded lending-related commitments made to clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits were $9.2 billion and $9.1 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.156The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows.(in billions)Fair value of assets held by VIEsLiquidity facilitiesExcess/(deficit)(a)Maximum exposureNonconsolidated municipal bond vehicles    June 30, 2014$11.5$6.4$5.1$6.4December 31, 201311.86.94.96.9 Ratings profile of VIE assets(b)Fair value of assets held by VIEsWt. avg. expected life of assets (years) Investment-grade Noninvestment- grade(in billions, except where otherwise noted)AAA to AAA-AA+ to AA-A+ to A-BBB+ to BBB- BB+ and belowJune 30, 2014$2.7$8.6$0.2$— $—$11.55.1December 31, 20132.78.90.2— —11.87.2(a)Represents the excess/(deficit) of the fair values of municipal bond assets available to repay the liquidity facilities, if drawn.(b)The ratings scale is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated Balance Sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.157Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

The difference between total assets and total liabilities recognized for consolidated VIEs represents the Firm’s interest in the consolidated VIEs for each program type.(f)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $33.6 billion and $31.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The maturities of the long-term beneficial interests as of June 30, 2014, were as follows: $6.5 billion under one year, $19.1 billion between one and five years, and $8.0 billion over five years, all respectively.(g)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Loan SecuritizationsThe Firm securitizes a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans. For a further  description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.158Cash flows from securitizationsThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.

All loans transferred into securitization vehicles during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, were classified as trading assets; changes in fair value were recorded in principal transactions revenue, and there were no significant gains or losses associated with the securitization activity.(c)Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from off–balance sheet, nonconsolidated entities – for example, loan repurchases due to representation and warranties and servicer clean-up calls.(d)Includes prime, Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes certain loan securitization transactions entered into with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.(e)Includes commercial and student loan securitizations.Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying any of the transactions described above as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.

Gains on loans sales include the value of MSRs.(d)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.159Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm may elect to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of June 30, 2014, and  December 31, 2013, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $14.3 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 13 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.    Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Goodwill impairment testingFor further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing process, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 299–300 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2014, or December 31, 2013, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.However, the Firm expects that the goodwill associated with its Private Equity business in Corporate will decline or could become impaired in future periods.In addition, the Firm’s Mortgage Banking business in CCB remains at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. economic conditions, such as increases in primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, or decreases in home prices, and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes, including higher costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters. Deterioration in the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test could cause the estimated fair values of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.161Mortgage servicing rightsMortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and Note 3 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

The Firm’s credit risk associated with recoverable servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. Servicer advances are recognized net of an allowance for unrecoverable advances.(f)Predominantly represents excess mortgage servicing rights transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired and has retained the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. Also includes sales of MSRs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.(g)For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the decrease was primarily related to higher capital allocated to the Mortgage Servicing business, which, in turn, resulted in an increase in the option adjusted spread (“OAS”). The resulting OAS assumption continues to be consistent with capital and return requirements that the Firm believes a market participant would consider, taking into account factors such as the current operating risk environment and regulatory and economic capital requirements. (h)For the six months ended June 30, 2013, the increase was driven by the inclusion in the MSR valuation model of servicing fees receivable on certain delinquent loans.(i)For the six months ended June 30, 2013, the decrease was driven by changes in the inputs and assumptions used to derive prepayment speeds, primarily increases in home prices.162The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates)Jun 30, 2014 Dec 31, 2013Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”)8.56% 8.07%Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change$(363) $(362)Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change(704) (705)Weighted-average option adjusted spread9.14% 7.77%Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change$(343) $(389)Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change(660) (750)CPR: Constant prepayment rate. The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsThe $279 million decrease in other intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2014, was due to amortization.163The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Basel III rules under the transitional Standardized and Advanced Approaches (“Basel III Standardized Transitional” and “Basel III Advanced Transitional,” respectively) became effective on January 1, 2014; all prior period data is based on Basel I rules. For 2014, Basel III Standardized Transitional requires the Firm to calculate its capital ratios using the Basel III definition of capital divided by the Basel I definition of RWA, inclusive of Basel 2.5 for market risk. On February 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve and the OCC informed the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries that they were approved to calculate capital under Basel III Advanced, in addition to Basel III Standardized, as of April 1, 2014. As of January 1, 2014, there are three categories of risk-based capital: Common Equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1 capital”) under the Basel III Transitional rules, as well asTier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common stockholders’ equity (including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS as well as for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans), less certain deductions for goodwill, MSRs and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Basel III establishes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA, a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach. Key differences in the calculation of RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches include: (1) for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary only by counterparty type and asset class; and (2) Basel III Advanced includes RWA for operational risk, whereas Basel III Standardized does not. As a result of becoming subject to Basel III Advanced on April 1, 2014, the capital adequacy of the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries will be evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) that results, for each quarter beginning with the second quarter of 2014, in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”), as required by the Collins Amendment of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The following tables present the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking subsidiaries under both Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional at June 30, 2014, and under Basel I at December 31, 2013.

At June 30, 2014, Chase Bank USA, N.A. had no trust preferred securities.(b)Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio, include total quarterly average assets adjusted for unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, less deductions for disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets, investments in certain subsidiaries, and the total adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments that are subject to deductions from Tier 1 capital.(c)Beginning April 1, 2014, the lower ratio represents the Collins Floor.(d)Asset and capital amounts for JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries reflect intercompany transactions; whereas the respective amounts for JPMorgan Chase reflect the elimination of intercompany transactions.Note:Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both non-taxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from non-taxable business combinations totaling $145 million and $192 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $2.8 billion at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. Bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table presents the minimum ratios to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject as of June 30, 2014.

In addition to the 2014 well-capitalized standards, beginning January 1, 2015, Basel III Transitional CET1 capital and the Basel III Standardized Transitional and the Basel III Advanced Transitional CET1 capital ratios become relevant capital measures under the prompt corrective action requirements defined by the regulations.As of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.169Note 21 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale lending commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. Also, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due.170Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments  Contractual amount Carrying value(j) Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Jun 30, 2014Dec 31, 2013By remaining maturity (in millions)Expires in 1 year or lessExpires after 1 year through 3 yearsExpires after 3 years through 5 yearsExpires after 5 yearsTotalTotal   Lending-related         Consumer, excluding credit card:         Home equity – senior lien$2,332$4,303$3,050$2,268$11,953$13,158 $—$—Home equity – junior lien3,7076,3383,4602,26115,76617,837 ——Prime mortgage6,679———6,6794,817 ——Subprime mortgage—————— ——Auto9,006371122229,5218,309 11Business banking10,51688611737711,89611,251 87Student and other99372457595685 ——Total consumer, excluding credit card(a)32,33911,9356,7515,38556,41056,057 98Credit card(b)533,688———533,688529,383 ——Total consumer566,02711,9356,7515,385590,098585,440 98Wholesale:         Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(c)(d)59,66476,645108,4108,628253,347246,495 410432Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(c)(d)(e)23,88432,69933,0202,12691,72992,723 851943Unused advised lines of credit89,00011,649559473101,681101,994 ——Other letters of credit(c)3,402994122—4,5185,020 12Total wholesale(f)175,950121,987142,11111,227451,275446,232 1,2621,377Total lending-related$741,977$133,922$148,862$16,612$1,041,373$1,031,672 $1,271$1,385Other guarantees and commitments         Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(g)$208,317$—$—$—$208,317$169,709 $—$—Derivatives qualifying as guarantees1,08879513,83637,73353,45256,274 4472Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements(h)74,198———74,19838,211 ——Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:         Mortgage repurchase liabilityNANANANANANA 436681Loans sold with recourseNANANANA6,7757,692 115131Other guarantees and commitments(i)4373532,6162,0995,5056,786 (79)(99)(a)Predominantly all consumer, excluding credit card, lending-related commitments contractual amounts are in the U.S.(b)Predominantly all credit card lending-related commitments contractual amounts are in the U.S.(c)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, reflects the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $184 million and $476 million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $14.3 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $538 million and $622 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.(d)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included credit enhancements and bond and commercial paper liquidity commitments to U.S. states and municipalities, hospitals and other non-profit entities of $17.0 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, within other unfunded commitments to extend credit; and $15.2 billion and $17.2 billion, respectively, within standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees. Other unfunded commitments to extend credit also include liquidity facilities to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs; for further information, see Note 15.(e)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included unissued standby letters of credit commitments of $44.8 billion and $42.8 billion, respectively.(f)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the U.S. portion of the contractual amount of total wholesale lending-related commitments was 67% and 68%, respectively.(g)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $216.3 billion and $176.4 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral comprises primarily cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies.(h)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the amount of commitments related to forward-starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements were $40.7 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements with regular-way settlement periods were $33.5 billion and $28.3 billion, at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(i)At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included unfunded commitments of $130 million and $215 million, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $691 million and $1.9 billion, at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, to other equity investments. These commitments included $111 million and $184 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3. In addition, at both June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $4.5 billion.(j)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value.171Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, and extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged finance activities, which were $23.1 billion and $18.3 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4.In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as clearing and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. Tri-party repurchase daily balances averaged $181 billion and $279 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $182 billion and $287 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. GuaranteesThe Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $852 million and $945 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $229 million and $265 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $623 million and $680 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013(in millions)Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesOther letters of credit Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesOther letters of creditInvestment-grade(a) $68,440 $3,551  $69,109 $3,939Noninvestment-grade(a) 23,289 967  23,614 1,081Total contractual amount $91,729 $4,518  $92,723 $5,020Allowance for lending-related commitments $228 $1  $263 $2Commitments with collateral 40,331 1,718  40,410 1,473(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $53.5 billion and $56.3 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to  certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $27.2 billion and $27.0 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.9 billion and 2.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $86 million and 172$109 million and derivative receivables of $42 million and $37 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsMortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs, as described in Note 15 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm has been, and may be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs (e.g., with “make-whole” payments to reimburse the GSEs for their realized losses on liquidated loans). To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense.For additional information, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability(a) Three monthsended June 30, Six months ended June 30,(in millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Repurchase liability at beginning of period$564 $2,674 $681 $2,811Net realized gains/(losses)(b)8 (191) 19 (403)(Benefit)/provision for repurchase(c)(136) (7) (264) 68Repurchase liability at end of period$436 $2,476 $436 $2,476(a)On October 25, 2013, the Firm announced that it had reached a $1.1 billion agreement with the FHFA to resolve, other than certain limited types of exposures, outstanding and future mortgage repurchase demands associated with loans sold to the GSEs from 2000 to 2008.(b)Presented net of third-party recoveries and include principal losses and accrued interest on repurchased loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expense. Make-whole settlements were $1 million and $133 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively and $3 million and $254 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(c)Included a provision related to new loan sales of $1 million and $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $2 million and $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Private label securitizationsThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Loans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $6.8 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $115 million and $131 million at June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.173Note 22 – Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, see Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Pledged assetsAt June 30, 2014, financial assets were pledged to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial assets owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had pledged assets of $269.0 billion and $251.3 billion, respectively, at Federal Reserve Banks and FHLBs. In addition, as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had pledged $53.9 billion and $60.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities, see Note 12. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt, see Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.CollateralAt June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $777.3 billion and $726.7 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $586.6 billion and $543.5 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. Note 23 – LitigationContingenciesAs of June 30, 2014, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $4.6 billion at June 30, 2014. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm’s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.CIO Investigations and Litigation. The Firm has been sued in a consolidated shareholder purported class action, a consolidated purported class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and shareholder derivative actions brought in Delaware state court and in New York federal and state court relating to 2012 losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). Plaintiffs in two of the shareholder derivative actions and the ERISA action have appealed the dismissal of their claims. The Firm also continues to cooperate with ongoing government investigations.Credit Default Swaps Investigations and Litigation. In July 2013, the European Commission (the “EC”) filed a Statement of Objections against the Firm (including various subsidiaries) and other industry members in connection with its ongoing investigation into the credit default swaps (“CDS”) marketplace. The EC asserts that between 2006 174and 2009, a number of investment banks acted collectively through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) and Markit Group Limited (“Markit”) to foreclose exchanges from the potential market for exchange-traded credit derivatives. The Firm submitted a response to the Statement of Objections in January 2014, and the EC held a hearing in May 2014. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) also has an ongoing investigation into the CDS marketplace, which was initiated in July 2009.Separately, the Firm and other industry members are defendants in nine purported class actions (all consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) filed on behalf of purchasers and sellers of CDS and asserting federal antitrust law claims. Each of the complaints refers to the ongoing investigations by the EC and DOJ into the CDS market, and alleges that the defendant investment banks and dealers, including the Firm, as well as Markit and/or ISDA, collectively prevented new entrants into the CDS market. Defendants moved to dismiss in May 2014.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm has received information requests, document production notices and related inquiries from various U.S. and non-U.S. government authorities regarding the Firm’s foreign exchange trading business. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with the relevant authorities.Since November 2013, a number of class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against a number of foreign exchange dealers, including the Firm, for alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and unjust enrichment based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates reported on the WM/Reuters service. In March 2014, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss in May 2014.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The parties have entered into an agreement to settle the cases, for a cash payment of $6.1 billion to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm’s share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network’s rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. In December 2013, the Court issued a decision granting final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants have appealed. Certain merchants that opted out of the class settlement have filed actions against Visa and MasterCard, as well as  against the Firm and other banks, which are subject to pending motions to dismiss.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending cases that allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management (“JPMIM”) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited claim that JPMIM is liable for losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. Discovery is proceeding.Italian Proceedings.City of Milan. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the “City”) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the District Court of Milan alleging a breach of advisory obligations in connection with a bond issue by the City in June 2005 and an associated swap transaction. The Firm has entered into a settlement agreement with the City to resolve the City’s civil proceedings.Four current and former JPMorgan Chase employees and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) were directed by a criminal judge to participate in a trial that started in May 2010. As it relates to JPMorgan Chase individuals, two were acquitted and two were found guilty of aggravated fraud with sanctions of prison sentences, fines and a ban from dealing with Italian public bodies for one year. JPMorgan Chase (along with other banks involved) was found liable for breaches of Italian administrative law. JPMorgan Chase and the individuals appealed, and the Court fully acquitted JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its employees, stating that there was no case to answer. The deadline to file an appeal to the Italian Supreme Court has passed without an appeal being filed.Parmalat. In 2003, following the bankruptcy of the Parmalat group of companies (“Parmalat”), criminal prosecutors in Italy investigated the activities of Parmalat, its directors and the financial institutions that had dealings with them following the collapse of the company. In March 2012, the criminal prosecutor served a notice indicating an intention to pursue criminal proceedings against four former employees of the Firm (but not against the Firm) on charges of conspiracy to cause Parmalat’s insolvency by underwriting bonds and continuing derivatives trading when Parmalat’s balance sheet was false. A preliminary hearing, in which the judge will determine whether to recommend that the matter go to a full trial, is ongoing.In addition, the administrator of Parmalat commenced five civil actions against JPMorgan Chase entities including: two claw-back actions; a claim relating to bonds issued by Parmalat in which it is alleged that JPMorgan Chase kept Parmalat “artificially” afloat and delayed the declaration of insolvency; and similar allegations in two claims relating to derivatives transactions.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Committee”) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against 175JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $7.9 billion in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI’s bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s collateral requests hastened LBHI’s bankruptcy. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint that sought to void the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008.The Firm has filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion in claims (the “Clearing Claims”) against the estate of Lehman Brothers Inc., LBHI’s broker-dealer subsidiary. Discovery is ongoing.LBHI and the Committee have filed an objection to the claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to the Clearing Claims, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for such claims in a commercially reasonable manner. LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors have also filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm responded to this separate complaint and objection in February 2013. The Clearing Claims and the derivatives claims, together with other claims of the Firm against Lehman entities, have been paid in full, subject to the outcome of the objections filed by LBHI and the Committee. Discovery in both cases is ongoing.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the EC, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various  parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. In December 2013, JPMorgan Chase reached a settlement with the EC regarding its Japanese Yen LIBOR investigation and agreed to pay a fine of €80 million. Investigations by the EC with regard to other reference rates remain open. In May 2014, the EC issued a Statement of Objections outlining its case against the Firm (and others) as to EURIBOR. The Firm will file a response. In January 2014, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced that it has discontinued its investigation related to Yen LIBOR.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class actions filed in various United States District Courts, in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and/or EURIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are impacted by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR or EURIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages.The U.S. dollar LIBOR-related purported class actions have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In March 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims in three lead class actions, including dismissal with prejudice of the antitrust claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction. In September 2013, class plaintiffs in two of the three lead class actions filed amended complaints and others sought leave to amend their complaints to add additional allegations. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaints and opposed the requests to amend. In June 2014, the Court issued a further order granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motions to dismiss the remaining claims. In relation to the Firm, the Court has permitted certain claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims to proceed. With respect to the third lead class action, which the Court dismissed in its entirety, after plaintiff’s appeal was dismissed by the Second Circuit, plaintiff sought and obtained leave to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the question whether its appeal could proceed before final resolution of the other consolidated class actions. To date, the other U.S. dollar LIBOR cases have been stayed.The purported class action alleging manipulation of Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased or sold exchange-traded Euroyen futures and options contracts. In March 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss including dismissal of plaintiff’s antitrust and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants have filed 176motions to reconsider, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims. Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to further amend the complaint to add additional parties and claims.In March 2014, the Firm was added as a defendant in a putative class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the interest rate benchmark EURIBOR. The Firm was also named as a nominal defendant in a derivative action in the Supreme Court of New York in the County of New York against certain current and former members of the Firm’s board of directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm’s purported role in manipulating LIBOR. In March 2014, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and plaintiff did not appeal this decision. Madoff Litigation and Investigations. Settlements with the court-appointed trustee (the “Trustee”) for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“BLMIS”) and with plaintiffs representing a class of former BLMIS customers who lost all or a portion of their principal investments with BLMIS have now been approved. Certain customers have opted out of the class action settlement.Various subsidiaries of the Firm, including J.P. Morgan Securities plc, have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, “Fairfield”), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions seek to recover payments made by the funds to defendants totaling approximately $155 million. All but two of these actions have been dismissed. In addition, a purported class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against the Firm and certain subsidiaries to an already pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The Court dismissed these complaints and plaintiffs have appealed. In September 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision. The plaintiffs then petitioned the entire Court for a rehearing of the appeal, and in May 2014 the Court denied the petition.The Firm is a defendant in five other Madoff-related investor actions pending in New York state court. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The Firm has moved to dismiss these actions. In May 2014, the parties submitted briefs on the res judicata effect of the class action settlement and a decision is pending.A purported class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., Madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested)  in Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and were not included in the class action settlement. These plaintiffs allege violations of the federal securities law, federal and state racketeering statutes and multiple common law claims including breach of trust, aiding and abetting embezzlement, unjust enrichment, conversion and commercial bad faith. The complaint seeks compensatory damages in the amount of the last statement balance for each plaintiff and punitive damages. A similar action has been filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the “Florida Action”), although it is not styled as a class action, and the plaintiffs, in addition to net winners, include a small number of net loser opt-outs. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the Florida Action which includes only net winners, includes a claim pursuant to a Florida statute and dismisses three common law claims that were included in the earlier complaint.Three shareholder derivative actions have also been filed in New York federal and state court against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former Board members, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm’s relationship with Bernard Madoff and the alleged failure to maintain effective internal controls to detect fraudulent transactions. The actions seek declaratory relief and damages. In July 2014, the federal court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss two of the actions and defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the remaining state court action.MF Global. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one of several defendants in a number of purported class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global’s publicly traded securities asserting violations of federal securities laws and alleging that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global. The Firm also has responded to inquiries from the CFTC relating to the Firm’s banking and other business relationships with MF Global, including as a depository for MF Global’s customer segregated accounts.Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates (together, “JPMC”), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, “Bear Stearns”) and certain Washington Mutual affiliates (together, “Washington Mutual”) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). These cases include purported class action suits on behalf of MBS purchasers, actions by individual MBS purchasers and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of MBS offerings. Following the settlements referred to under “Repurchase Litigation” and “Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation” below, there are currently pending and tolled investor and monoline insurer claims involving MBS with an original principal balance of approximately $48 billion, of which $42 billion involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual as issuer and $6 billion involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual solely as underwriter. The Firm and 177certain of its current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities, and trustees have asserted or have threatened to assert claims that loans in securitization trusts should be repurchased.Issuer Litigation – Class Actions. Three purported class actions were brought against JPMC and Bear Stearns as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings) in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. The Firm has reached an agreement to settle one of these purported class actions, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. That settlement has received final court approval. Motions to dismiss have largely been denied in the remaining two cases pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which are in various stages of litigation.Issuer Litigation – Individual Purchaser Actions. In addition to class actions, the Firm is defending individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings). These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the United States and are in various stages of litigation.Monoline Insurer Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending actions relating to a monoline insurer’s guarantees of principal and interest on certain classes of 11 different Bear Stearns MBS offerings. These actions are pending in state court in New York and are in various stages of litigation. Underwriter Actions. In actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable in various situations, such as where the issuers are now defunct. There are currently such actions pending against the Firm in federal and state courts in various stages of litigation.Repurchase Litigation. The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees or master servicers of various MBS trusts and others on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys’ fees and costs and other remedies. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, has filed such a suit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Washington Mutual and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) in connection with a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation. In addition, the Firm received threatened litigation demands by securitization trustees, as well as demands by investors directing trustees to investigate claims or bring litigation, which allege obligations to repurchase loans and to address servicing deficiencies. These include but are not limited to a demand from a law firm, as counsel to a group of 21 institutional MBS investors, to various trustees to investigate potential repurchase and servicing claims. These investors purported to have 25% or more of the voting rights in trusts sponsored by the Firm or its affiliates with an original principal balance of more than $174 billion (excluding 52 trusts sponsored by Washington Mutual, with an original principal balance of more than $58 billion). Pursuant to a settlement agreement, JPMC and this investor group have made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to the 330 MBS trusts. The offer, which is subject to acceptance by the trustees, and potentially a judicial approval process, does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. On August 1, 2014, the trustees announced their determination to accept the offer in whole or in part for 310 of the 330 MBS trusts and to proceed with seeking judicial approval of such acceptance. The trustees rejected the settlement offer in whole or in part for six trusts that are subject to pending monoline insurer or repurchase litigation, and received a 60-day extension to solicit investor direction on whether the offer should be accepted for an additional 14 trusts and for certain loan groups in 13 trusts for which the offer was accepted in part on August 1, 2014.There are additional repurchase and servicing claims made against trustees not affiliated with the Firm but involving trusts that the Firm sponsored.Derivative Actions. Shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities have been filed against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors, in New York state court and California federal court. Two of the New York actions have been dismissed and defendants have filed, or intend to file, motions to dismiss the remaining actions.Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. The Firm has also received other subpoenas and informal requests for information from federal and state authorities concerning the issuance and underwriting of MBS-related matters. The Firm continues to respond to these MBS-related regulatory inquiries.In addition, the Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with requests for information from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut, subpoenas and requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement, and a 178request from the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program to conduct a review of certain activities, all of which relate to, among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain secondary market trading in residential and commercial MBS. The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation.Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorney General of Massachusetts filed an action against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company, asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry’s electronic mortgage registry. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the action, which remains pending.The Firm is named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. The plaintiffs have moved for class certification.One shareholder derivative action has been filed in New York Supreme Court against the Firm’s Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. In June 2014, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which is pending.The Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm’s compliance with the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) in connection with its mortgage lending practices. In addition, three municipalities have commenced litigation against the Firm alleging violations of the FHA and ECOA and seeking damages in the form of lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. A motion to dismiss has been filed in one of the actions.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is responding to inquiries by the Executive Office of the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and various regional U.S. Bankruptcy Trustees relating to mortgage payment change notices and escrow statements in bankruptcy proceedings.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that  all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees.Power Matters. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is investigating matters relating to the bidding activities that were the subject of the July 2013 settlement between J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. Referral Hiring Practices Investigations. Various regulators are investigating, among other things, the Firm’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with respect to the Firm’s hiring practices related to candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials, and its engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these investigations. Sworn Documents, Debt Sales and Collection Litigation Practices. The Firm has been responding to formal and informal inquiries from various state and federal regulators regarding practices involving credit card collections litigation (including with respect to sworn documents), the sale of consumer credit card debt and securities backed by credit card receivables.Separately, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and multiple state Attorneys General are conducting investigations into the Firm’s collection and sale of 179consumer credit card debt. The California and Mississippi Attorneys General have filed separate civil actions against JPMorgan Chase & Co., Chase Bank USA, N.A. and Chase BankCard Services, Inc. alleging violations of law relating to debt collection practices.Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC and amended to include JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a defendant, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. The District Court denied as premature motions by JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank’s claims. The defendants have filed additional motions as to that issue.An action filed by certain holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt against JPMorgan Chase, which alleges that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at a price that was allegedly too low, remains pending. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs’ claim that JPMorgan Chase tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs’ bond contracts with Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closure. Discovery is ongoing.JPMorgan Chase has also filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank and in its corporate capacity asserting multiple claims for indemnification under the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement between JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC relating to JPMorgan Chase’s purchase of most of the assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank. * * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its  outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm incurred legal expense of $669 million and $678 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $707 million and $1.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.180Note 24 – Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business Segment Results on page 19 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 84–85 and Note 33 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Segment resultsThe accompanying tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm revised the capital allocated to certain businesses and will continue to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments. Further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Segment results and reconciliation(a)As of or for the three months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios)Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset Management20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Noninterest revenue$4,468$4,921 $6,531$7,171 $577$551 $2,380$2,156Net interest income6,9637,094 2,4602,705 1,1241,177 576569Total net revenue11,43112,015 8,9919,876 1,7011,728 2,9562,725Provision for credit losses852(19) (84)(6) (67)44 123Noninterest expense6,4566,864 6,0585,742 675652 2,0621,892Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)4,1235,170 3,0174,140 1,0931,032 893810Income tax expense/(benefit)1,6802,081 1,0541,302 435411 341310Net income/(loss)$2,443$3,089 $1,963$2,838 $658$621 $552$500Average common equity$51,000$46,000 $61,000$56,500 $14,000$13,500 $9,000$9,000Total assets447,277460,642 873,288873,527 192,523184,124 128,362115,157Return on average common equity19%27% 13%20% 19%18% 25%22%Overhead ratio5657 6758 4038 7069As of or for the three months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios)Corporate/Private Equity Reconciling Items(b) Total20142013 20142013 20142013Noninterest revenue$351$290 $(651)$(582) $13,656$14,507Net interest income(81)(676) (244)(165) 10,79810,704Total net revenue270(386) (895)(747) 24,45425,211Provision for credit losses(10)5 —— 69247Noninterest expense180716 —— 15,43115,866Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)100(1,107) (895)(747) 8,3319,298Income tax expense/(benefit)(269)(555) (895)(747) 2,3462,802Net income/(loss)$369$(552) $—$— $5,985$6,496Average common equity$71,159$72,283 $—$— $206,159$197,283Total assets878,886806,044 NANA 2,520,3362,439,494Return on average common equityNMNM NMNM 11%13%Overhead ratioNMNM NMNM 6363181Segment results and reconciliation(a)As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios)Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset Management20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Noninterest revenue$7,902$9,327 $12,767$14,528 $1,135$1,086 $4,598$4,250Net interest income13,98914,303 4,8305,488 2,2172,315 1,1361,128Total net revenue21,89123,630 17,59720,016 3,3523,401 5,7345,378Provision for credit losses1,668530 (35)5 (62)83 (8)44Noninterest expense12,89313,654 11,66211,853 1,3611,296 4,1373,768Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)7,3309,446 5,9708,158 2,0532,022 1,6051,566Income tax expense/(benefit)2,9513,771 2,0282,710 817805 612579Net income/(loss)$4,379$5,675 $3,942$5,448 $1,236$1,217 $993$987Average common equity$51,000$46,000 $61,000$56,500 $14,000$13,500 $9,000$9,000Total assets447,277460,642 873,288873,527 192,523184,124 128,362115,157Return on average common equity17%25% 13%19% 18%18% 22%22%Overhead ratio5958 6659 4138 7270As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios)Corporate/Private Equity Reconciling Items(b) Total20142013 20142013 20142013Noninterest revenue$875$651 $(1,295)$(1,146) $25,982$28,696Net interest income(237)(1,270) (470)(327) 21,46521,637Total net revenue638(619) (1,765)(1,473) 47,44750,333Provision for credit losses(21)2 —— 1,542664Noninterest expense14718 —— 30,06731,289Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)645(1,339) (1,765)(1,473) 15,83818,380Income tax expense/(benefit)(64)(1,037) (1,765)(1,473) 4,5795,355Net income/(loss)$709$(302) $—$— $11,259$13,025Average common equity$68,989$71,016 $—$— $203,989$196,016Total assets878,886806,044 NANA 2,520,3362,439,494Return on average common equityNMNM NMNM 11%13%Overhead ratioNMNM NMNM 6362(a)Managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications that do not have any impact on net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole.(b)Segment managed results reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 19, 2014, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.Allowance for loan losses to total loans: Represents period-end allowance for loan losses divided by retained loans.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt, equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates.Benefit obligation: Refers to the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans.Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e., Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security and is assigned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s. This system facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities. A similar system is used to identify non- U.S. securities (CUSIP International Numbering System).Exchange traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk provided by credit bureaus, typically produced from statistical models by Fair Isaac Corporation utilizing data collected by the credit bureaus.Forward points: Represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., “spot rate”) to determine the forward exchange rate.Group of Seven (“G7”) nations: Countries in the G7 are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. G7 government bonds: Bonds issued by the government of one of the G7 nations.Headcount-related expense: Includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.Home equity - senior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds the first security interest on the property.Home equity - junior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens.Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment system. “Investment grade” generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a “BBB-”/“Baa3” or better, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.LLC: Limited Liability Company.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.186Mortgage product types:Alt-AAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans to customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningful.Over-the-counter derivatives (“OTC”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.Over-the-counter cleared derivatives (“OTC cleared”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instruments, private equity investments, and physical commodities used in market-making and client-driven activities. In addition, Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specified risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same 187fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”): Risk-weighted assets consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk-weighted assets.Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the related mortgage and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds.Structural interest rate risk: Represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm.Structured notes: Structured notes are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. Where present, the embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.Trade-date and settlement-date: For financial instruments, the trade-date is the date that an order to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire an instrument is executed in the market. The trade-date may differ from the settlement-date, which is the date on which the actual transfer of a financial instrument between two parties is executed. The amount of time that passes between the trade-date and the settlement-date differs depending on the financial instrument. For repurchases under the common equity repurchase program, except where the trade-date is specified, the amounts disclosed are presented on a settlement-date basis. In the Capital Management section on pages 74–80, and where otherwise specified, repurchases under the common equity repurchase program are presented on a trade-date basis because the trade-date is used to calculate the Firm’s regulatory capital.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations:Obligations of agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury.Value-at-risk (“VaR”): A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.188Wallet: Proportion of fee revenues based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e. the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic, a third party provider of investment banking competitive analysis and volume-based league tables for the above noted industry products. Warehouse loans: Consist of prime mortgages originated with the intent to sell that are accounted for at fair value and classified as trading assets.Washington Mutual transaction: On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain of the assets of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual”) from the FDIC.LINE OF BUSINESS METRICSCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (“CCB”)Active online customers - Users of all internet browsers and mobile platforms who have logged in within the past 90 days.Active mobile customers - Users of all mobile platforms, which include: SMS, mobile smartphone and tablet, who have logged in within the past 90 days.Consumer & Business Banking (“CBB”)Description of selected business metrics within CBB:Client investment managed accounts - Assets actively managed by Chase Wealth Management on behalf of clients.

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis on pages 69–71 of this Form 10-Q and pages 142–148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Item 4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 182 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.191Part II Other InformationItem 1 Legal ProceedingsFor information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in the Firm’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, see the discussion of the Firm’s material litigation in Note 23 of this Form 10-Q.Item 1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of certain risk factors affecting the Firm,see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9–18 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Forward-Looking Statements on page 89 of this Form 10-Q.Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
