(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations in more than 60 countries. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm's business-segment information, see Note 24 on pages 180–182 of this Form 10-Q. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2010 Annual Report”).Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. NOTE 2 – BUSINESS CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSIncrease in common stock dividendOn March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors raised the Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.25 per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2011, to shareholders of record on April 6, 2011.Stock repurchasesOn March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion common equity repurchase program, of which $8.0 billion is authorized for repurchase in 2011. The $15.0 billion repurchase program supersedes a $10.0 billion repurchase program approved in 2007. The $15.0 billion authorization includes shares to be repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s employee stock-based incentive plans.The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.For additional information on repurchases see Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, on pages 193–194 of this Form 10-Q.NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTFor a further discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 3 on pages 170–187 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.During the first six months of 2011, no changes were made to the Firm’s valuation models that had, or were expected to have, a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.The following table presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, by major

62,949  $  1,511,388  $  46,649  $  (1,415,890 )  $  205,096       (a) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $124.0 billion and $137.3 billion respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related. 104          (b) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included within trading loans were $20.1 billion and $22.7 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $11.9 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively.       (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.       (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions) when the long and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”).      (e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Therefore, the balances reported in the fair value hierarchy table are gross of any counterparty netting adjustments. However, if the Firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivable and payable balances would be $13.5 billion and $12.7 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.      (f) Private equity instruments represent investments within the Corporate/Private Equity line of business. The cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $9.6 billion and $10.0 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.      (g) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, balances included investments valued at net asset values of $12.2 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, of which $6.0 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, were classified in level 1, $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, in level 2, and $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, in level 3.      (h) For the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, the transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3, were not significant.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011and 2010. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.         105                                          Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs    Three months endedJune 30, 2011 Fair value at April 1,

(b) Predominantly reported in principal transactions revenue, except for changes in fair value for Retail Financial Services ("RFS") mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, which are reported in mortgage fees and related income.      (c) Realized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, as well as other-than-temporary impairment losses that are recorded in earnings, are reported in securities gains. Unrealized gains / (losses) are reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Realized gains / (losses) and foreign exchange remeasurement adjustments recorded in income on AFS securities were $103 million and $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 109     and 2010, and were $434 million and $(65) million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Unrealized gains / (losses) reported on AFS securities in OCI were $(8) million and $(42) million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and were $148 million and $(107) million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      (d) Changes in fair value for RFS mortgage servicing rights are reported in mortgage fees and related income.      (e) Largely reported in other income.      (f) Loan originations are included in purchases.      (g) All transfers into and/or out of level 3 are assumed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The following tables present the assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by caption and level within the valuation hierarchy as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the reporting period.

(c) Predominantly includes credit card loans at December 31, 2010. Loans held-for-sale are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of cost or fair value.      (d) For the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, the transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 were not significant.      (e) The prior period has been revised to conform with the current presentation.The method used to estimate the fair value of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate, nonfinancial assets) underlying the loan. Fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices, broker quotes or independent appraisals. For further information, see Note 14 on pages 149–150 of this Form 10-Q.Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, related to financial instruments held at those dates. 110                           Three months ended June 30,   Six months ended June 30,    (in millions) 2011 2010   2011 2010    Loans retained $  (709  )  $ (1,109 ) (a)  $  (1,272  )  $ (2,142 ) (a)   Loans held-for-sale 13  (3 )   38  65     Total loans (696 )  (1,112  )   (1,234 )  (2,077  )    Other assets (48 ) 11    (47 ) 29     Accounts payable and other liabilities (4 ) —     1  5      Total nonrecurring fair value gains/(losses) $ (748  ) $  (1,101 )    $ (1,280  ) $  (2,043 )   (a) Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation.Level 3 analysisLevel 3 assets at June 30, 2011, predominantly include derivative receivables, mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”), collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) held within the AFS securities portfolio, loans and asset-backed securities in the trading portfolio and private equity investments.       • Derivative receivables included $34.2 billion of interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity contracts classified within level 3 at June 30, 2011. Credit derivative receivables of $15.1 billion include $9.9 billion of structured credit derivatives with corporate debt underlying and $3.3 billion of credit default swaps on commercial mortgages where the risks are partially mitigated by similar and offsetting derivative payables. Interest rate derivative receivables of $5.9 billion include long-dated structured interest rate derivatives which are dependent on correlation. Equity derivative receivables of $5.2 billion principally include long-dated contracts where the volatility levels are unobservable. Foreign exchange derivative receivables of $4.6 billion include long-dated foreign exchange derivatives which are dependent on the correlation between foreign exchange and interest rates.      • Mortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of future cash flows for performing specified mortgage servicing activities for others (predominantly with respect to residential mortgage loans). For a further description of the MSR asset, the interest rate risk management and valuation methodology used for MSRs, including valuation assumptions and sensitivities, see Note 17 on pages 260–263 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report and Note 16 on pages 159–163 of this Form 10-Q.      • CLOs totaling $15.1 billion are securities backed by corporate loans held in the AFS securities portfolio. Substantially all of these securities are rated “AAA,” “AA” and “A” and had an average credit enhancement of 30%. Credit enhancement in CLOs is primarily in the form of subordination, which is a form of structural credit enhancement where realized losses associated with assets held by the issuing vehicle are allocated to the various tranches of securities issued by the vehicle considering their relative seniority. For further discussion, see Note 11 on pages 128–132 of this Form 10-Q.       • Trading loans totaling $11.7 billion included $5.7 billion of residential mortgage whole loans and commercial mortgage loans for which there is limited price transparency; and $3.9 billion of reverse mortgages for which the principal risk sensitivities are mortality risk and home prices. The fair value of the commercial and residential mortgage loans is estimated by projecting expected cash flows, considering relevant borrower-specific and market factors, and discounting those cash flows at a rate reflecting current market liquidity. Loans are partially hedged by level 2 instruments, including credit default swaps and interest rate derivatives, for which valuation inputs are observable and liquid.Consolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 5% of total Firm assets at June 30, 2011. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2010.For the three months ended June 30, 2011 Level 3 assets were $109.8 billion at June 30, 2011, reflecting a decrease of $6.3 billion from the first quarter largely related to a:      • $4.4 billion decrease in nonrecurring loans held-for-sale driven by sales in the loan portfolios;For the six months ended June 30, 2011 Level 3 assets decreased by $4.9 billion in the first six months of 2011, due to the following:      • $3.0 billion net decrease in nonrecurring loans held-for-sale driven by sales in the loan portfolios;       • $1.4 billion decrease in trading loans primarily due to asset sales      • $1.4 billion decrease in MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16 on pages 159–163 of this Form 10-Q.       • $1.6 billion increase in asset-backed AFS securities, predominantly driven by purchases of new issuance CLOs; 111    Gains and LossesIncluded in the tables for the three months ended June 30, 2011       • $960 million of losses on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16 on pages 159–163 of this Form 10-Q.Included in the tables for the three months ended June 30, 2010       • $2.0 billion of net gains on derivatives, largely driven by the widening of credit spreads       • $632 million in gains related to long-term structured note liabilities, largely driven by the volatility in the equity markets       • $3.6 billion of losses on MSRs predominantly due to declines in interest ratesIncluded in the tables for the six months ended June 30, 2011       • $1.7 billion gain in private equity, predominately driven by net increases in investment valuations and sales in the portfolio.      • $1.2 billion of net gains on derivatives, largely driven by increase in interest rate derivatives;      • $1.7 billion of losses on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16 on pages 159–163 of this Form 10-QIncluded in the tables for the six months ended June 30, 2010       • $3.7 billion of losses on MSRs predominantly due to declines in interest rates      • $1.2 billion of gains in net derivatives receivables      • $1.0 billion of gains related to long-term structured note liabilities, primarily due to volatility in the equities markets.Credit adjustments When determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuation adjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are not limited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm’s own creditworthiness. The market’s view of the Firm’s credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the credit default swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, see Note 3 on pages 170–187 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity, reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based upon the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in a loan loss reserve calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in a loan loss reserve calculation. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see Note 3 pages 171–173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.      (b) Effective January 1, 2011, $23.0 billion of long-term advances from Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) were reclassified from other borrowed funds to long-term debt. The prior-year period has been revised to conform with the current presentation.113    The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm’s wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which are recognized at fair value at the inception of guarantees.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law.

NOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE OPTIONFor a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was previously elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note 4 on pages 187–189 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.114                                   Three months ended June 30,    2011    2010  (in millions) Principaltransactions Other income Total changesin fair value recorded   Principaltransactions Other income Total changes in fair value recorded  Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $  121   $  —     $ 121    $ 261  $ —    $ 261   Securities borrowed (8 ) —    (8 )   27  —    27   Trading assets:                    Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans 107  (4 ) (c)  103    40  (12 ) (c)  28   Loans reported as trading assets:                    Changes in instrument-specific credit risk 429  4  (c)  433    389  28  (c)  417   Other changes in fair value 13   1,371   (c)  1,384     (299 ) 1,217  (c)  918   Loans:                    Changes in instrument-specific credit risk (7  ) —     (7  )   32  —    32   Other changes in fair value 139  —    139    (44 ) —    (44 )  Other assets —   (42  ) (d)  (42  )   —  (49 ) (d)  (49 )  Deposits(a) (93 ) —    (93 )   (103 ) —    (103 )  Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements (14  ) —     (14  )   (56 ) —    (56 )  Other borrowed funds(a)  739  —    739    838  —    838   Trading liabilities (3  ) —     (3  )   —  —    —   Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs (55 ) —    (55 )   (14 ) —    (14 )  Other liabilities (1  ) (1  ) (d)  (2  )   (19 ) 14  (d)  (5 )  Long-term debt:                    Changes in instrument-specific credit risk(a)  145   —     145     534  —    534   Other changes in fair value(b) (93  ) —     (93  )   1,332  —    1,332                                Six months ended June 30,    2011    2010  (in millions) Principaltransactions Other income Total changesin fair value recorded   Principaltransactions Other income Total changes in fair value recorded  Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $  3  $  —     $ 3    $ 280  $ —    $ 280   Securities borrowed 1  —    1    39  —    39   Trading assets:                    Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans 271  (1 ) (c)  270    196  (11 ) (c)  185   Loans reported as trading assets:                    Changes in instrument-specific credit risk 909  4  (c)  913    798  22  (c)  820   Other changes in fair value 138   2,094   (c)  2,232     (683 ) 1,972  (c)  1,289   Loans:                    Changes in instrument-specific credit risk (13  ) —     (13  )   79  —    79   Other changes in fair value 282  —    282    (71 ) —    (71 )  Other assets —   (42  ) (d)  (42  )   —  (102 ) (d)  (102 )  Deposits(a) (110 ) —    (110 )   (292 ) —    (292 )  Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 21   —     21     (65 ) —    (65 )  Other borrowed funds(a)  956  —    956    912  —    912   Trading liabilities (6  ) —     (6  )   (3 ) —    (3 )  Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs (89 ) —    (89 )   32  —    32   Other liabilities (4  ) (3  ) (d)  (7  )   4  14  (d)  18   Long-term debt:                    Changes in instrument-specific credit risk(a)  199   —     199     585  —    585   Other changes in fair value(b) (117  ) —     (117  )   1,558  —    1,558       (a) Total changes in instrument-specific credit risk related to structured notes were $142 million and $588 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $165 million and $696 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Those totals include adjustments for structured notes classified within deposits and other borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt.115         (b) Structured notes are debt instruments with embedded derivatives that are tailored to meet a client’s need. The embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of such risk management instruments.      (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.      (d) Reported in other income.Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

Unlike principal-protected notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note.      (b) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflected as the remaining contractual principal is the final principal payment at maturity.At both June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $3.8 billion, with a corresponding fair value of $(6) million.

While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.117     Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following tables summarize information on derivative fair values that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.       (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to changes in spot foreign currency rates, were recorded in principal transactions revenue.       (c) Consists of overall fair value hedges of certain commodities inventories. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.       (d) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.       (e) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income.      (f) Included $(1.8) billion and $3.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $(5.0) billion and $5.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of revenue related to certain foreign exchange trading derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. 119    Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.      (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily net interest income, compensation expense and other expense.       (c) The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the Firm reclassified a $25 million loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to earnings because the Firm determined that it was probable that forecasted interest payment cash flows related to certain wholesale deposits would not occur.      (d) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.120    Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $96 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2011, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities. Net investment hedge gains and losses The following tables present hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. There was no ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. Risk management derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedging instruments)The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated in hedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. These derivatives are risk management instruments used to mitigate or transform market risk exposures arising from banking activities other than trading activities, which are discussed separately below.

(b) Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.       (c) Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.121    Trading derivative gains and lossesThe following table presents trading derivatives gains and losses, by contract type, that are recorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. The Firm has elected to present derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with the cash instruments with which they are risk managed.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation.Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresThe aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingent collateral or termination features triggered upon a downgrade was $15.4 billion at June 30, 2011, for which the Firm has posted collateral of $11.2 billion in the normal course of business. At June 30, 2011, the impact of a single-notch and two-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), would have required $1.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of additional collateral to be posted by the Firm. In addition, at June 30, 2011, the impact of single-notch and two-notch ratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., related to contracts with termination triggers would have required the Firm to settle trades with a fair value of $430 million and $930 million, respectively.The following tables show the carrying value of derivative receivables and payables after netting adjustments and adjustments for collateral held and transferred as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.

(b) Represents cash collateral received and paid that is not subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement, and liquid securities collateral held and transferred.       (c) Represents liquid securities and cash collateral held and transferred at the initiation of derivative transactions, which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move, as well as collateral held and transferred related to contracts that have non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted, and collateral that the Firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. These amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the tables above, because, at an individual counterparty level, the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at both June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.122    Credit derivatives For a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including a description of the different types used by the Firm, see Note 6 on pages 191–199 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes                     Maximum payout/Notional amount  June 30, 2011 Protection sold Protection purchased with identical underlyings(b) Net protection (sold)/purchased(c) Other protection purchased(d)  (in millions)  Credit derivatives           Credit default swaps $ (2,972,180 ) $ 2,912,446  $ (59,734 ) $ 38,797   Other credit derivatives(a) (120,733  ) 36,278   (84,455  ) 25,002    Total credit derivatives (3,092,913 )  2,948,724  (144,189 )  63,799   Credit-related notes (1,544  ) —   (1,544  ) 4,009    Total $ (3,094,457 ) $ 2,948,724  $ (145,733 ) $ 67,808                Maximum payout/Notional amount  December 31, 2010 Protection sold Protection purchased with identical underlyings(b) Net protection (sold)/purchased(c) Other protection purchased(d)  (in millions)  Credit derivatives           Credit default swaps $ (2,659,240 ) $ 2,652,313  $ (6,927 ) $ 32,867   Other credit derivatives(a) (93,776 ) 10,016  (83,760 ) 24,234   Total credit derivatives (2,753,016  ) 2,662,329   (90,687  ) 57,101    Credit-related notes (2,008 ) —  (2,008 ) 3,327   Total $ (2,755,024  ) $ 2,662,329   $ (92,695  ) $ 60,428         (a) Primarily consists of total return swaps and credit default swap options.

Subsequent credit losses may be recorded on securities without a corresponding further decline in fair value if there has been a decline in expected cash flows. Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income, related to debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.

As of June 30, 2011, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2011.Following is a description of the Firm’s principal investment securities with the most significant unrealized losses that have been existing for 12 months or more as of June 30, 2011, and the key assumptions used in the Firm’s estimate of the present value of the cash flows most likely to be collected from these investments.Mortgage-backed securities – Prime and Alt-A nonagencyAs of June 30, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers were $180 million, of which $179 million related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Approximately 58% of the total portfolio (by amortized cost) are currently rated below investment-grade; the Firm has recorded OTTI losses on 66% of the below investment-grade positions. The majority of OTTI has been attributed to securities that are primarily backed by mortgages with higher credit risk characteristics based on collateral type, vintage and geographic concentration. The remaining securities that are below investment-grade that have not experienced OTTI generally either do not possess all of these characteristics or have sufficient credit enhancements to protect the investment. The average credit enhancements associated with the below investment-grade and investment-grade positions are 8% and 44%, respectively. In analyzing prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses, the Firm uses a methodology that focuses on loan-level detail to estimate future cash flows, which are then allocated to the various tranches of the securities. The loan-level analysis primarily considers current home value, loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio, loan type and geographical location of the underlying property to forecast prepayment, home price, default rate and loss severity. The forecasted weighted average underlying default rate on the positions was 24%, and the related weighted average loss severity was 47%. Based on this analysis, an OTTI loss of $13 million and $43 million was recognized for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively, on certain securities related to higher loss assumptions. Overall unrealized losses have decreased since December 31, 2010, with the recovery in security prices resulting from increased demand for higher-yielding asset classes and a deceleration in the pace of home price declines due in part to the U.S. government programs to facilitate financing and to spur home purchases. The unrealized loss of $180 million is considered temporary, based on management’s assessment that the estimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firm’s investment. 130    Mortgage-backed securities – Non-U.S.As of June 30, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities were $317 million, of which $230 million related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Substantially all of these securities are rated “AAA,” “AA” or “A” and represent mortgage exposures to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The key assumptions used in analyzing non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses include credit enhancements, recovery rates, default rates, and constant prepayment rates. Credit enhancement is primarily in the form of subordination, which is a form of structural credit enhancement where realized losses associated with assets held in an issuing vehicle are allocated to the various tranches of securities issued by the vehicle considering their relative seniority. Credit enhancement in the form of subordination was approximately 10% of the outstanding principal balance of securitized mortgage loans, compared with expected lifetime losses of 1.5% of the outstanding principal. In determining potential credit losses, assumptions included recovery rates of 60%, default rates of 0.25% to 0.5% and constant prepayment rates of 15% to 20%. The unrealized loss is considered temporary, based on management's assessment that the estimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firm's investment.Asset-backed securities – Collateralized loan obligationsAs of June 30, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to CLOs were $117 million, of which $113 million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Overall losses have decreased since December 31, 2010, mainly as a result of lower default forecasts and spread tightening across various asset classes. Substantially all of these securities are rated “AAA,” “AA” or “A” and have an average credit enhancement of 30%. The key assumptions considered in analyzing potential credit losses were underlying loan and debt security defaults and loss severity. Based on current default trends for the collateral underlying the securities, the Firm assumed collateral default rates of 2% for the second quarter of 2011, and 4% thereafter. Further, loss severities were assumed to be 48% for loans and 82% for debt securities. Losses on collateral were estimated to occur approximately 18 months after default. The unrealized loss is considered temporary, based on management's assessment that the estimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firm's investment.131    Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at June 30, 2011, of JPMorgan Chase’s AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable.      (c) Includes securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately five years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, three years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and five years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 132    NOTE 12 – SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 on page 219 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.

The amounts reported in the table above were reduced by $109.4 billion and $112.7 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, as a result of agreements in effect that meet the specified conditions for net presentation under applicable accounting guidance.For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22 on page 171 of this Form 10-Q. 133    NOTE 13 – LOANSLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:      • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans      • Loans held-for-sale      • Loans at fair value      • PCI loans held-for-investmentFor a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 220–238 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 114–116 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 on pages 102–114 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Loan portfolioThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Wholesale; Consumer, excluding credit card; and Credit card. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:             Wholesale(a)     Consumer, excluding credit card(b)    Credit card   • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other    Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Home equity – senior lien• Home equity – junior lien• Prime mortgage, including option adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”)• Subprime mortgageOther consumer loans• Auto(c) • Business banking(c) • Student and other Residential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs    • Chase, excluding accounts originated by Washington Mutual• Accounts originated by Washington Mutual      (a) Includes loans reported in IB, Commercial Banking (“CB”), Treasury & Securities Services (“TSS”), Asset Management (“AM”) and Corporate/Private Equity segments.      (b) Includes RFS and residential real estate loans reported in the Corporate/Private Equity segment.      (c) Includes risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by RFS and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.     134    The following table summarizes the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment:                    June 30, 2011 (in millions) Wholesale  Consumer, excludingcredit card Credit card  Total     Retained $  244,224   $ 315,169  $ 125,523  $ 684,916  (a)   Held-for-sale 2,592  221  —  2,813     At fair value 2,007  —  —  2,007     Total $ 248,823   $ 315,390   $ 125,523   $ 689,736                   December 31, 2010 (in millions) Wholesale  Consumer, excludingcredit card Credit card  Total     Retained $ 222,510  $ 327,464  $ 135,524  $ 685,498  (a)   Held-for-sale 3,147  154  2,152  5,453     At fair value 1,976   —   —   1,976      Total $  227,633  $  327,618  $  137,676  $  692,927         (a) Loans (other than PCI loans and those for which the fair value option has been selected) are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan costs of $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, retained loans sold and retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value. On an on-going basis, the Firm manages its exposure to credit risk.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned each loan.

(b) For wholesale loans, the past due status of a loan is generally not a significant indicator of credit quality due to the ongoing review and monitoring of an obligor’s ability to meet contractual obligations. For a discussion of more significant factors, see Note 14 on page 223 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.      (c) Represents loans that are 90 days or more past due as to principal and/or interest, but that are still accruing interest; these loans are considered well-collateralized.

The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens and mortgage loans with interest-only payment options to predominantly prime borrowers, as well as certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.Consumer loans, other than PCI loans and the risk-rated loans within the business banking and auto portfolios, are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) policy.

(b) Represents loans where JPMorgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens.  Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans, excluding credit card. Other indicators that are taken into consideration for consumer loans, excluding credit card, include:      • For residential real estate loans, including both non-PCI and PCI portfolios: The current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of loans with a junior lien, the geographic distribution of the loan collateral, and the borrowers’ current or “refreshed” FICO score.       • For scored auto and business banking loans and student loans: Geographic distribution of the loans.       • For risk-rated business banking and auto loans: Risk rating of the loan, geographic considerations relevant to the loan and whether the loan is considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 220–238 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.

The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm’s residential real estate – excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, the borrower is either unable or unwilling to repay the loan, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at estimated collateral value that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 139                        Residential real estate – excluding PCI loans              Home equity    Senior lien   Junior lien  (in millions, except ratios) June 30, 2011 December 31, 2010   June 30, 2011 December 31, 2010  Loan delinquency(a)            Current and less than 30 days past due $ 22,252  $ 23,615    $ 58,345  $ 62,315   30–149 days past due 361   414    1,215   1,508   150 or more days past due 356   347    222   186   Total retained loans $ 22,969  $ 24,376     $ 59,782  $ 64,009    % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans 3.12 % 3.12 %   2.40 % 2.65 %  90 or more days past due and still accruing $ —  $ —    $ —  $ —   90 or more days past due and government guaranteed(b) —  —    —  —   Nonaccrual loans 481  479     827  784    Current estimated LTV ratios(c)(d)(e)(f)            Greater than 125% and refreshed FICO scores:            Equal to or greater than 660 $ 350  $ 363    $ 6,699  $ 6,928   Less than 660 176   196    2,251   2,495   101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:            Equal to or greater than 660 690   619    9,389   9,403   Less than 660 268  249    2,745  2,873   80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:            Equal to or greater than 660 1,955  1,900    12,423  13,333   Less than 660 653   657    2,832   3,155   Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:            Equal to or greater than 660 16,199   17,474    20,459   22,527   Less than 660 2,678  2,918    2,984  3,295   U.S. government-guaranteed —  —     —  —    Total retained loans $ 22,969   $  24,376    $ 59,782   $  64,009   Geographic region            California $ 3,201  $ 3,348    $ 13,699  $ 14,656   New York 3,162   3,272    11,658   12,278   Texas 3,290  3,594    2,036  2,239   Florida 1,033   1,088    3,215   3,470   Illinois 1,553  1,635    3,987  4,248   Ohio 1,871   2,010    1,438   1,568   New Jersey 708  732    3,397  3,617   Michigan 1,101   1,176    1,501   1,618   Arizona 1,393  1,481    2,738  2,979   Washington 737   776    2,017   2,142   All other (g) 4,920   5,264    14,096   15,194   Total retained loans $ 22,969  $ 24,376     $ 59,782  $ 64,009   (a) Individual delinquency classifications included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current and less than 30 days past due includes $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion; 30–149 days past due includes $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion; and 150 or more days past due includes $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. (b) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due but insured by U.S. government agencies, are excluded from nonaccrual loans. In predominately all cases, 100% of the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed servicing guidelines. These amounts are excluded from nonaccrual loans because reimbursement of insured and guaranteed amounts is proceeding normally and is expected to occur. At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, these balances included $5.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest because interest has been curtailed by the U.S. government agencies although, in predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal is still insured. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. (c) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models utilizing nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates.(d) Junior lien represents combined LTV, which considers all available lien positions related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm at least on a quarterly basis.(f) For senior lien home equity loans, prior-period amounts have been restated to the current-period presentation.(g) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $13.1 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively.(h) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $10.1 billion and $10.3 billion, respectively. These amounts were excluded as reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally.  140    (table continued from previous page)                              Mortgages        Prime, including option ARMs     Subprime   Total residential real estate – excluding PCI    June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010     June 30, 2011 December 31, 2010   June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010                             $ 59,841    $ 59,223      $ 8,015  $ 8,477    $ 148,453    $ 153,630     3,130     4,052      896   1,184    5,602     7,158     11,305     11,264      1,530   1,626    13,413     13,423     $ 74,276    $ 74,539       $ 10,441  $ 11,287     $ 167,468    $ 174,211      5.90  % (h)  6.68 % (h)    23.24 % 24.90 %   5.35 % (h)  5.88 % (h)   $ —    $ —      $ —  $ —    $ —    $ —     9,129    9,417      —  —    9,129    9,417     4,024    4,320       2,058  2,210     7,390    7,793                                                        $ 3,005    $ 3,039      $ 360  $ 338    $ 10,414    $ 10,668     1,477     1,595      1,120   1,153    5,024     5,439                              4,683     4,733      528   506    15,290     15,261     1,793    1,775      1,446  1,486    6,252    6,383                              10,251    10,720      881  925    25,510    26,878     2,674     2,786      1,761   1,955    7,920     8,553                              32,669     32,385      1,989   2,252    71,316     74,638     4,625    4,557      2,356  2,672    12,643    13,442     13,099    12,949       —  —     13,099    12,949      $ 74,276     $  74,539      $ 10,441   $  11,287    $ 167,468     $  174,211                              $ 18,580    $ 19,278      $ 1,601  $ 1,730    $ 37,081    $ 39,012     9,817     9,587      1,288   1,381    25,925     26,518     2,731    2,569      323  345    8,380    8,747     4,688     4,840      1,309   1,422    10,245     10,820     3,892    3,765      424  468    9,856    10,116     452     462      254   275    4,015     4,315     2,016    2,026      491  534    6,612    6,909     943     963      266   294    3,811     4,051     1,248    1,320      221  244    5,600    6,024     1,979     2,056      230   247    4,963     5,221     27,930     27,673      4,034   4,347    50,980     52,478     $ 74,276    $ 74,539       $ 10,441  $ 11,287     $ 167,468    $ 174,211    Residential real estate impaired loans and loan modifications – excluding PCI loansThe Firm is participating in the U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable (“MHA”) programs and is continuing to expand its other loss-mitigation efforts for financially distressed borrowers who do not qualify for the MHA programs.

These modifications generally provided interest rate concessions to the borrower or deferral of principal repayments.      (b) There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.       (c) When discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This result typically occurs when an impaired loan has been partially charged off.      (d) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Administration (“RHA”)) were excluded from loans accounted for as TDRs. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.      (e) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs; net deferred loan fees or costs; and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.The following table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.

(b) Management concluded as part of the Firm’s regular assessment of the PCI loan pools that it was probable that higher expected principal credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows. As a result, an allowance for loan losses for impairment of these pools has been recognized.      (c) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models utilizing nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions related to the property.      (d) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score obtained by the Firm. The Firm obtains refreshed FICO scores at least quarterly.      (e) For home equity loans, prior-period amounts have been restated to conform to the current-period presentation. 145    The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. This table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.

For the six months ended June 30, 2011, other changes in expected cash flows were principally driven by changes in prepayment assumptions. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, other changes in expected cash flows were principally driven by changes in prepayment assumptions, as well as reclassification to the nonaccretable difference. Changes to prepayment assumptions change the expected remaining life of the portfolio, which drives changes in expected future interest cash collections. Such changes do not have a significant impact on the accretable yield percentage.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Since the date of acquisition, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expected cash flows but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). Extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time.146    Credit card loan portfolioThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm, including those acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.The borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality. Because the credit score tends to be a lagging indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not use credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality. For more information on credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 220–238 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ refreshed FICO scores may change over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology.The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s Credit Card loans.

Under guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC"), credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification about a specified event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), whichever is earlier.      (b) Refreshed FICO scores are estimated based on a statistically significant random sample of credit card accounts in the credit card portfolio for the period shown. The Firm obtains refreshed FICO scores at least quarterly.      (c) Includes billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.147    Credit card impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 on pages 220–238 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.The tables below set forth information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average ultimate default rate for modified credit card loans was 37.40% at June 30, 2011 and 36.45% at December 31, 2010.

(b) There were no impaired loans without an allowance.      (c) Represents credit card loans outstanding to borrowers enrolled in a credit card modification program as of the date presented.      (d) Represents credit card loans that were modified in TDRs but that have subsequently reverted back to the loans’ pre-modification payment terms. At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, approximately $850 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. The remaining $469 million and $590 million at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed.

Upon adoption of the guidance, the Firm consolidated its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts, its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and certain other consumer loan securitization entities, primarily mortgage-related. As a result, $7.4 billion, $14 million and $127 million, respectively, of allowance for loan losses were recorded on-balance sheet with the consolidation of these entities. For further discussion, see Note 16 on pages 244–259 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.      (b) Relates to risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring.      (c) At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the asset-specific consumer excluding credit card allowance for loan losses included troubled debt restructuring reserves of $962 million and $946 million, respectively. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses is related to loans modified in TDRs.      (d) At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses on all impaired credit card loans was reclassified to the asset-specific allowance. This reclassification has no incremental impact on the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Prior periods have been revised to reflect the current presentation.       (e) Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation.      (f) Includes collateral-dependent residential mortgage loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. These loans are considered collateral-dependent under regulatory guidance because they involve modifications where an interest-only period is provided or a significant portion of principal is deferred.  149    The table below summarizes information about the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.                                    2011    2010  Six months ended June 30, (in millions) Wholesale  Consumer, excluding credit card Credit Card  Total    Wholesale  Consumer, excluding credit card Credit Card  Total   Allowance for lending-related commitments                        Beginning balance at January 1, $ 711  $ 6    $ —  $ 717    $ 927  $ 12    $ —  $ 939   Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles(a) —   —     —   —     (18 ) —    —  (18 )  Provision for lending-related commitments (89 ) —    —  (89 )   4  (2 )   —  2   Other (2 ) —    —  (2 )   (11  )  —     —   (11  )   Ending balance at June 30, $ 620   $ 6     $ —   $ 626     $  902  $  10    $  —  $  912   Allowance for lending-related commitments by impairment methodology                        Asset-specific $ 144  $ —    $ —  $ 144    $ 248  $ —    $ —  $ 248   Formula-based 476  6    —  482    654   10     —   664    Total allowance for lending-related commitments $ 620   $ 6     $ —   $ 626     $  902  $  10    $  —  $  912   Lending-related commitments by impairment methodology                        Asset-specific $ 793  $ —    $ —  $ 793    $ 1,195  $ —    $ —  $ 1,195   Formula-based 364,896  64,649    535,625  965,170    323,357   69,499     550,442   943,298    Total lending-related commitments $ 365,689   $ 64,649     $ 535,625   $ 965,963     $  324,552  $  69,499    $  550,442  $  944,493       (a) Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted accounting guidance related to VIEs. Upon adoption of the guidance, the Firm consolidated its administered multi-seller conduits. As a result, related assets are now primarily recorded in loans and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  150    NOTE 15 – VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs, and a detailed discussion of the Firm’s principal involvement with VIEs, see Note 1 on pages 164–165, and Note 16 on pages 244–259, respectively, of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.

Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s involvement with credit card securitizations, see pages 245–246 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm’s primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. The Firm consolidated $52.7 billion and $68.5 billion of assets held by Firm-sponsored credit-card securitization trusts and $35.7 billion and $44.3 billion of beneficial interests issued to third parties at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s other creditors.Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsFor a detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment related to such trusts, see Note 16 on page 246 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement, including those that are consolidated or not consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. In the table below, the amount of beneficial interests held by JPMorgan Chase does not equal the assets held in nonconsolidated VIEs because of the existence of beneficial interests held by third parties, which are reflected at their current outstanding par amounts; and because a portion of the Firm’s retained interests (trading assets and AFS securities) are reflected at their fair values. See Securitization activity on pages 156–158 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs. 151                                Principal amount outstanding   JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in nonconsolidated VIEs(d)(e)(f)(g)(h)  June 30, 2011(a) (in billions) Total assets held by securitization VIEs Assets held in consolidated securitization VIEs Assets held in nonconsolidated securitization VIEs with continuing involvement   Trading assets AFSsecurities Total interests held by JPMorgan Chase  Securitization-related                Residential mortgage:                Prime(b) $ 140.3  $ 2.2  $ 132.0    $ 0.7  $ —  $ 0.7   Subprime 41.6  1.4  38.5    —  —  —   Option ARMs 33.7   0.3   33.4     —   —   —    Commercial and other(c) 144.3  —  96.4    1.6  0.7  2.3   Student 4.3  4.3  —    —   —  —    Total $ 364.2   $ 8.2   $ 300.3  (i)  $ 2.3   $ 0.7   $ 3.0                               Principal amount outstanding   JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in nonconsolidated VIEs(d)(e)(f)(g)(h)  December 31, 2010(a) (in billions) Total assets held by securitization VIEs Assets held in consolidated securitization VIEs Assets held in nonconsolidated securitization VIEs with continuing involvement   Trading assets AFSsecurities  Total interests held by JPMorgan Chase  Securitization-related                 Residential mortgage:                Prime(b) $ 153.1  $ 2.2  $ 143.8    $ 0.7  $ —  $ 0.7   Subprime 44.0  1.6  40.7    —  —  —   Option ARMs 36.1  0.3  35.8    —  —  —   Commercial and other(c) 153.4  —  106.2    2.0  0.9  2.9   Student 4.5  4.5  —    —  —  —   Total $  391.1  $  8.6  $  326.5  (i)  $  2.7  $  0.9  $  3.6       (a) Excludes loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

The Firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Includes co-sponsored commercial securitizations and, therefore, includes non-JPMorgan Chase-originated commercial mortgage loans.

See Note 5 on pages 117–124 of this Form 10-Q for further information on derivatives.      (g) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.       (h) As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, 66% and 66%, respectively of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. This includes $175 million and $157 million of investment-grade and $480 million and $552 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests in prime residential mortgages at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, and $2.0 billion and $2.6 billion of investment-grade and $282 million and $250 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts.      (i) The Firm does not consolidate a mortgage securitization when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Firm did not consolidate any of the assets of the Firm-sponsored nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Additionally, for the commercial mortgage securitization-related VIEs, the Firm does not service the loans, and thus does not consolidate the VIEs. Re-securitizations The Firm also engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur to both agency (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs, which may be backed by either residential or commercial mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.152     Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients are seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its client(s), considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.In more limited circumstances, the Firm creates a re-securitization trust independently and not in conjunction with specific clients. In these circumstances, the Firm is deemed to have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust because of the decisions made during the establishment and design of the trust; therefore, the Firm consolidates the re-securitization VIE if the Firm holds an interest that could potentially be significant.Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust, either because it wasn’t involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, the Firm consolidated $357 million and $477 million of assets, and $155 million and $230 million of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, total assets of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitizations were $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively, the Firm transferred $8.5 billion and $17.3 billion of securities to agency VIEs, and zero and $192 million of securities to private-label VIEs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, the Firm transferred $7.8 billion and $14.3 billion of securities to agency VIEs, and $663 million and $1.0 billion of securities to private-label VIEs. At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, the Firm held approximately $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $10 million and $46 million of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See pages 158 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered, multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 249–250 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest. The Firm consolidated $22.2 billion and $21.7 billion of assets held by Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and $22.2 billion and $21.6 billion of beneficial interests in commercial paper issued to third parties at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.The Firm provides deal-specific liquidity as well as program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement to the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm-administered multi-seller conduits then provide certain of their clients with lending-related commitments. The unfunded portion of these commitments was $11.3 billion and $10.0 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, and are included as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21 on pages 167–171 of this Form 10-Q.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 250–251 of JPMorgan Chases 2010 Annual Report. The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows.

The Firm provided insurance on underlying municipal bonds, in the form of letters of credit, of $10 million at both June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.       (b) Represents the excess/(deficit) of the fair values of municipal bond assets available to repay the liquidity facilities, if drawn.      (c) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings and is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.The Firm consolidated $3.3 billion and $4.6 billion of municipal bond vehicles as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, due to the Firm owning the residual interests.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 244–259 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.Exposure to nonconsolidated credit-related note and asset swap VIEs at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, was as follows.

(b) On-balance sheet exposure that includes net derivative receivables and trading assets – debt and equity instruments.      (c) The Firm’s maximum exposure arises through the derivatives executed with the VIEs; the exposure varies over time with changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The Firm relies on the collateral held by the VIEs to pay any amounts due under the derivatives; the vehicles are structured at inception so that the par value of the collateral is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts due under the derivative contracts.The Firm consolidated credit-related note vehicles with collateral fair values of $122 million and $142 million, at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010. The Firm consolidated these vehicles because in its role as secondary market-maker, it held positions in these entities that provided the Firm with control of certain vehicles.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 253 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.154    Investment in a third-party credit card securitization trustThe Firm holds two interests in a third-party-sponsored VIE, which is a credit card securitization trust that owns credit card receivables issued by a national retailer. The Firm is not the primary beneficiary of the trust as the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance. The Firm’s interests in the VIEs include investments classified as AFS securities that had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, and other interests which are classified as loans and have a fair value of approximately $1.0 billion at both June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010. For more information on AFS securities and loans, see Notes 11 and 13 on pages 128–132 and 134–148, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.

(b) Primarily comprised of student loans and municipal bonds.      (c) Includes assets classified as cash, derivative receivables, AFS securities, and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.      (d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The difference between total assets and total liabilities recognized for consolidated VIEs represents the Firm’s interest in the consolidated VIEs for each program type.      (e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $42.9 billion and $52.6 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The maturities of the long-term beneficial interests as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, were as follows: $13.0 billion and $13.9 billion under one year, $21.4 billion and $29.0 billion between one and five years, and $8.5 billion and $9.7 billion over five years.      (f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Supplemental information on loan securitizationsThe Firm securitizes and sells a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. 155    Securitization activityThe following tables provide information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, as sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization. For the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, there were no mortgage loans that were securitized, except for commercial and other, and there were no cash flows from the Firm to the SPEs related to recourse or guarantee arrangements.

(b) Includes $1.5 billion and $592 million, respectively, and $3.1 billion and $592 million, respectively, of proceeds from new securitizations received as securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. These securities were predominantly classified as level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy.      (c) Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from the off-balance sheet, nonconsolidated entities - for example, servicer clean-up calls.      (d) Includes cash flows received on retained interests - including, for example, principal repayments and interest payments.      (e) Includes Alt-A loans and re-securitization transactions.156    Loans sold to agencies and other third-party sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “Agencies”). These loans are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. In connection with these loan sales, the Firm makes certain representations and warranties. For additional information about the Firm’s loan sale- and securitization-related indemnifications, see Note 21 on pages 167–171 of this Form 10-Q.For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with loans sold to government sponsored agencies and other third-party sponsored securitization entities, see Note 16 on page 257 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. government sponsored agencies and third-party sponsored securitization entities.

(b) MSRs were excluded from the above table. See Note 16 on pages 159–163 of this Form 10-Q for further information on originated MSRs.      (c) Predominantly includes securities from U.S. government agencies that are generally sold shortly after receipt. Repurchased loans and loans subject to an option to repurchase When the Firm services loans for Ginnie Mae, it typically has the option to repurchase certain delinquent loans. The Firm also has similar rights in certain arrangements with other U.S. government agencies. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the balance sheet as a loan with an offsetting liability. As of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $13.2 billion and $13.0 billion, respectively, of loans that either have been repurchased or for which the Firm has an option to repurchase from the Agencies. Predominately all of the amounts presented above relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans sold to the Agencies was $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, and where applicable, reimbursement is proceeding normally. For additional information, refer to Note 13 on pages 134–148 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.157     JPMorgan Chase’s interest in securitized assets held at fair valueThe following table outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, of certain of the Firm’s retained interests in nonconsolidated VIEs (other than MSRs), that are valued using modeling techniques. The table also outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in assumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 159–163 of this Form 10-Q.

Additionally, the Firm had interests in option ARM securitizations of $27 million and $29 million at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.      (b) Includes certain investments acquired in the secondary market but predominantly held for investment purposes.      (c) CPR: constant prepayment rate.       (d) Includes retained interests in Alt-A loans and re-securitization transactions.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivities also do not reflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks.158     Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about delinquencies, liquidation losses and components of off-balance sheet securitized financial assets as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.                                         90 days past due   Liquidation losses    Credit exposure     Three months ended June 30,   Six months ended June 30,  (in millions) June 30, 2011 Dec 31, 2010   June 30, 2011 Dec 31, 2010   2011 2010   2011 2010  Securitized loans(a)                        Residential mortgage:                        Prime mortgage(b) $ 132,042  $ 143,764    $ 31,444  $ 33,093    $ 1,244  $ 1,696    $ 2,734  $ 3,385   Subprime mortgage 38,497   40,721    15,186   15,456    616   951    1,616   2,116   Option ARMs 33,412  35,786    10,358  10,788    465  637    908  1,226   Commercial and other 96,368  106,245     5,064  5,791     250  116     454  143    Total loans securitized(c) $ 300,319   $  326,516    $ 62,052   $  65,128    $ 2,575   $  3,400    $ 5,712   $  6,870       (a) Total assets held in securitization-related SPEs were $364.2 billion and $391.1 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.

(b) Includes foreign currency translation adjustments and other tax-related adjustments. Goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2011, or December 31, 2010, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the six month periods ended June 30, 2011 or 2010. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Firm reviewed current conditions and prior projections for all of its reporting units. In addition, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuations of its consumer lending businesses in RFS and Card Services (“CS”), as these businesses continue to have elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes. As a result of these reviews, the Firm concluded that goodwill for these businesses and the Firm’s other reporting units was not impaired at June 30, 2011.The Firm’s consumer lending businesses in RFS and CS remain at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of these businesses is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities, and those that may affect consumer credit card use), and the amount of equity capital required. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models were determined using management’s best estimates. The cost of equity reflected the related risks and uncertainties, and was evaluated in comparison to relevant market peers. Deterioration in these assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline, which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rightsMortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future fees and ancillary revenues, offset by estimated costs to service the loans. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights naturally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual and ancillary fee income. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Notes 17 on pages 260–263, respectively of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report and Note 3 on pages 102–114 of this Form 10-Q.In the first half of 2011, the fair value of the MSR declined, primarily due to changes to inputs and assumptions in the MSR valuation model. During the first quarter of 2011, the Firm revised its cost to service assumption to reflect the estimated impact of higher servicing costs to enhance servicing processes, particularly loan modification and foreclosure procedures, including costs to comply with Consent Orders entered into with banking regulators, which resulted in a $1.1 billion decrease in the fair value of the MSR asset. The increase in the cost to service assumption contemplates significant and prolonged increases in staffing levels in the core and default servicing functions, and specifically considers the higher cost to service certain high-risk vintages. In addition, the MSR decreased in value due to a decline in interest rates (which tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset). Other than the increased cost to service assumption and the decrease in interest rates, predominantly all of the changes in the fair value of the MSR asset resulted from the largely offsetting impacts of new capitalization and amortization.The decrease in the fair value of the MSR results in a lower asset value that will amortize in future periods against contractual and ancillary fee income received in future periods. While there is expected to be higher levels of noninterest expense associated with higher servicing costs in those future periods, there will also be less MSR amortization, which will have the effect of increasing mortgage fees and related income. The amortization of the MSR is reflected in the tables below in the row “Other changes in fair value.”  160    The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

(c) Includes changes related to commercial real estate of $(2) million and $(2) million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $(4) million and $(4) million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      (d) Includes $36 million and $37 million related to commercial real estate at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.      (e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest to a trust, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

(b) Represents MSR asset fair value adjustments due to changes in inputs, such as interest rates and volatility, as well as updates to assumptions used in the MSR valuation model.161    The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010; and it outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.               (in millions, except rates) June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010  Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”) 10.63  %   11.29 %  Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (775 )   $ (809 )  Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (1,500 )   (1,568  )   Weighted-average option adjusted spread 3.85  %   3.94 %  Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change $ (587 )   $ (578 )  Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change (1,125  )   (1,109 ) CPR: Constant prepayment rate.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.Other intangible assets The $360 million decrease in other intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2011, was predominantly due to $429 million in amortization.The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows.

AOCI decreased by $129 million due to the adoption of the accounting guidance related to VIEs, as a result of the reversal of the fair value adjustments taken on retained AFS securities that were eliminated in consolidation; for further discussion see Note 16 on pages 244–259 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.      (b) Represents the after-tax difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities accounted for as AFS.      (c) At June 30, 2011, January 1, 2011, June 30, 2010 and January 1, 2010, included after-tax unrealized losses not related to credit on debt securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income of $(62) million, $(81) million, $(126) million and $(226) million, respectively.       (d) The net change for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was due primarily to increased market value on agency MBS and municipal securities, partially offset by the widening of spreads on non-U.S. corporate debt and realization of gains due to portfolio repositioning. The net change for the six months ended June 30, 2010, was due primarily to the narrowing of spreads on MBS and CLOs partially offset by declines in non-U.S. government debt and realization of gains due to portfolio repositioning.      (e) The net change for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and 2010, included after-tax gains/(losses) on foreign currency translation from operations for which the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar of $498 million and $(489) million, respectively, partially offset by after-tax gains/(losses) on hedges of $(471) million and $464 million, respectively. The Firm may not hedge its entire exposure to foreign currency translation on net investments in foreign operations.      (f) The net change for the six months ended June 30, 2011, included $112 million of after-tax gains/(losses) recognized in income, and $(99) million of after-tax gains/(losses), representing the net change in derivative fair value that was reported in comprehensive income. The net change for the six months ended June 30, 2010, included $6 million of after-tax gains recognized in income and $171 million of after-tax gains, representing the net change in derivative fair value that was reported in comprehensive income.       (g) The net changes for the six month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, were due to after-tax adjustments based on the final year-end actuarial valuations for the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (for 2010 and 2009, respectively); and the amortization of net loss and prior service credit into net periodic benefit cost. 166     NOTE 21 – OFF–BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTSJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a discussion of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, see Note 30 on pages 275–280 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale and consumer (excluding credit card) contracts, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on pages 149–150 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.167     Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments                      Contractual amount   Carrying value(j)  (in millions) June 30, 2011 December 31, 2010   June 30, 2011 December 31, 2010  Lending-related            Consumer, excluding credit card:            Home equity – senior lien $ 17,265  $ 17,662    $ —  $ —   Home equity – junior lien 28,586  30,948    —  —   Prime mortgage 1,117   1,266    —   —   Subprime mortgage —  —    —  —   Auto 6,795   5,246    1  2   Business banking 10,046  9,702    5  4   Student and other 840  579     —  —    Total consumer, excluding credit card 64,649  65,403    6  6   Credit card 535,625  547,227    —  —   Total consumer 600,274  612,630    6  6   Wholesale:            Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(a)(b) 210,023  199,859    304  364   Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(a)(b)(c)(d) 97,050   94,837    686   705   Unused advised lines of credit 52,848  44,720    —  —   Other letters of credit(a)(d) 5,768  6,663     2  2    Total wholesale 365,689  346,079    992  1,071   Total lending-related $ 965,963  $ 958,709     $ 998  $ 1,077    Other guarantees and commitments            Securities lending guarantees(e) $ 205,411  $ 181,717    NA   NA   Derivatives qualifying as guarantees(f) 84,089  87,768    $ 321  $ 294   Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements(g) 59,570   39,927    —   —   Other guarantees and commitments(h) 6,177  6,492    (6 ) (6 )  Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:            Repurchase liability(i)  NA  NA    3,631  3,285   Loans sold with recourse 10,624  10,982     141  153        (a) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, represented the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $608 million and $542 million, respectively, for Other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $22.3 billion and $22.4 billion, respectively, for Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, for Other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve Board these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.      (b) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included credit enhancements and bond and commercial paper liquidity commitments to U.S. states and municipalities, hospitals and other not-for-profit entities of $46.4 billion and $43.4 billion, respectively. These commitments also include liquidity facilities to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs; for further information, see Note 15 on pages 151–159 of this Form 10-Q.      (c) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included unissued Standby letters of credit commitments of $41.9 billion and $41.6 billion, respectively.      (d) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, JPMorgan Chase held collateral relating to $39.3 billion and $37.8 billion, respectively, of Standby letters of credit; and $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of Other letters of credit.      (e) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $207.9 billion and $185.0 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral comprises primarily cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies.      (f) Represents notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees. The carrying value at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, reflected derivative payables of $420 million and $390 million, respectively, less derivative receivables of $99 million and $96 million, respectively.      (g) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the amount of commitments related to forward starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements were $14.0 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements with regular way settlement periods were $45.6 billion and $25.5 billion, at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.      (h) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included unfunded commitments of $876 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, to other equity investments. These commitments included $815 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3 on pages 102–114 of this Form 10-Q. In addition, at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $3.8 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.      (i) Represents the estimated repurchase liability related to indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties in loan sale and securitization agreements. For additional information, see Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications on pages 170–171 of this Note.      (j) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability, for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. For all other products the carrying value represents the valuation reserve. 168    Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, as well as extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged and acquisition finance activities, which were $7.1 billion and $5.9 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 102–114 and 114–116 respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Guarantees The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 30 on pages 275–280 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the related to guarantees and indemnifications at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments are discussed on pages 170–171 of this Note. Standby letters of credit Standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $688 million and $707 million at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $316 million and $347 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $372 million and $360 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit                          June 30, 2011   December 31, 2010  (in millions) Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Other letters of credit   Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Other letters of credit  Investment-grade(a)   $  74,222     $  4,399       $ 70,236    $ 5,289   Noninvestment-grade (a)   22,828     1,369       24,601    1,374   Total contractual amount(b)   $ 97,050  (c)  $ 5,768      $ 94,837   (c)  $ 6,663    Allowance for lending-related commitments   $ 314    $ 2      $ 345    $ 2   Commitments with collateral   39,335    1,748      37,815     2,127        (a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.      (b) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, represented contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $22.3 billion and $22.4 billion, respectively, for Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, for Other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.      (c) At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, included unissued Standby letters of credit commitments of $41.9 billion and $41.6 billion, respectively.Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 30 on pages 275-280 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $84.1 billion and $87.8 billion at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $26.2 billion and $25.9 billion and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The fair values of the contracts reflects the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $420 million and $390 million and derivative receivables of $99 million and $96 million at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.169     In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5 on pages 117–124 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 6 on pages 191–199 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.Loan sale- and securitization-related indemnificationsIndemnifications for breaches of representations and warrantiesIn connection with the Firm’s loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs and other loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, as described in Notes 13 and 15 on pages 134–148 and 151–159, respectively, of this Form 10-Q, and Notes 14 and 16 on pages 220–238 and 244–259, respectively of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties; however, predominantly all of the repurchase demands received by the Firm and the Firm’s losses realized to date are related to loans sold to the GSEs.The Firm has recognized a repurchase liability of $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion, as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, which is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities net of probable recoveries from third parties.Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firm’s established methodology for computing its recorded repurchase liability – including factors such as the amount of probable future demands from purchasers, the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, and recoveries from third parties - require application of a significant level of management judgment. Estimating the repurchase liability is further complicated by limited and rapidly changing historical data and uncertainty surrounding numerous external factors, including: (i) macro-economic factors and (ii) the level of future demands, which is dependent, in part, on actions taken by third parties such as the GSEs and mortgage insurers. While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued as of June 30, 2011, are reasonably possible. The Firm believes the estimate of the range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of its established repurchase liability, is from $0 to approximately $2.2 billion at June 30, 2011. This estimated range of reasonably possible loss considers the Firm's GSE-related exposure based on an assumed peak to trough decline in home prices of 45%, which is an additional 11 percentage point decline in home prices beyond the Firm’s current assumptions, which were derived from a nationally recognized home price index. Although the Firm does not consider such further decline in home prices to be likely to occur, such a decline could increase the level of loan delinquencies, thereby potentially increasing the repurchase demand rate from the GSEs and increasing loss severity on repurchased loans, each of which could affect the Firm’s repurchase liability. Claims related to private-label securitizations have, thus far, generally manifested themselves through securities-related litigation, which the Firm has considered with other litigation matters as discussed in Note 23 on pages 172–179 of this Form 10-Q. Actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the Firm’s recorded repurchase liability or this estimate of reasonably possible additional losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those considered above.The following table summarizes the change in the repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability                      Three months ended June 30,   Six months ended June 30,   (in millions) 2011 2010    2011 2010   Repurchase liability at beginning of period $ 3,474  $ 1,982    $ 3,285  $ 1,705   Realized losses(a) (241  ) (317 )   (472  ) (563 )  Provision for repurchase losses 398   667    818   1,190   Repurchase liability at end of period $ 3,631  $ 2,332     $ 3,631  $ 2,332         (a) Includes principal losses and accrued interest on repurchased loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expenses. Make-whole settlements were $126 million and $150 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $241 million and $255 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.170    Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $10.6 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations was $141 million and $153 million at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively.NOTE 22 – PLEDGED ASSETS AND COLLATERALFor a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, see Note 31 on pages 280–281 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. Pledged assetsAt June 30, 2011, assets were pledged to collateralize repurchase agreements, other securities financing agreements, derivative transactions and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, at June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Firm had pledged $281.4 billion and $288.7 billion, respectively, of financial instruments it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 on pages 151–159 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 on pages 244–259 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report, for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For further information regarding pledged assets, see Note 31 on page 281 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.CollateralAt June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Firm had accepted assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $705.2 billion and $655.0 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $509.3 billion and $521.3 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. For further information regarding collateral, see Note 31 on page 281 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report.171    NOTE 23 – LITIGATIONContingencies As of June 30, 2011, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in more than 10,000 legal proceedings, in the form of regulatory/government investigations as well as private, civil litigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $5.1 billion at June 30, 2011. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm’s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants (including the Firm) in many of such proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims), and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more than the current estimate.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.Auction-Rate Securities Investigations and Litigation. Beginning in March 2008, several regulatory authorities initiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerning possible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities. The market for many such securities had frozen and a significant number of auctions for those securities began to fail in February 2008. The Firm, on behalf of itself and affiliates, agreed to a settlement in principle with the New York Attorney General’s Office which provided, among other things, that the Firm would offer to purchase at par certain auction-rate securities purchased from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“JPMorgan Securities”; formerly J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.), Chase Investment Services Corp. and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. by individual investors, charities and small- to medium-sized businesses. The Firm also agreed to a substantively similar settlement in principle with the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida and the North American Securities Administrators Association (“NASAA”) Task Force, which agreed to recommend approval of the settlement to all remaining states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Firm has finalized the settlement agreements with the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida. The settlement agreements provide for the payment of penalties totaling $25 million to all states. The Firm is currently in the process of finalizing consent agreements with NASAA’s member states; more than 45 of these consent agreements have been finalized to date.The Firm also faces a number of civil actions relating to the Firm’s sales of auction-rate securities, including a putative securities class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that seeks unspecified damages, and individual arbitrations and lawsuits in various forums brought by institutional and individual investors that, together, seek damages totaling more than $200 million relating to the Firm’s sales of auction-rate securities. One action is brought by an issuer of auction-rate securities. The actions generally allege that the Firm and other firms manipulated the market for auction-rate securities by placing bids at auctions that affected these securities’ clearing rates or otherwise supported the auctions without properly disclosing these activities. Some actions also allege that the Firm misrepresented that auction-rate securities were short-term instruments. The Firm has filed motions to dismiss each of the actions pending in federal court, which are being coordinated before the federal District Court in New York. These motions are currently pending.Additionally, the Firm was named in two putative antitrust class actions also pending in the federal District Court in New York. The actions allege that the Firm, along with numerous other financial institution defendants, colluded to maintain and stabilize the auction-rate securities market and then to withdraw their support for the auction-rate securities market. In January 2010, the District Court dismissed both actions. An appeal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters. Bear Stearns, certain current or former subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, including Bear Stearns Asset Management, Inc. (“BSAM”) and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., and certain individuals formerly employed by Bear Stearns are named defendants (collectively the “Bear Stearns defendants”) in multiple civil actions and arbitrations relating to alleged losses resulting from the failure of the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the “High Grade Fund”) and the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the “Enhanced Leverage Fund”) (collectively, the “Funds”). BSAM served as investment manager for both of the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands “feeder funds” that invested substantially all their assets, directly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are in liquidation.172    There are currently four civil actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Funds. Two of these actions involve derivative lawsuits brought on behalf of purchasers of partnership interests in the two U.S. feeder funds, alleging that the Bear Stearns defendants mismanaged the Funds and made material misrepresentations to and/or withheld information from investors in the feeder funds. These actions seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages based on alleged investor losses. The third action, brought by the Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feeder funds, makes allegations similar to those asserted in the derivative lawsuits related to the U.S. feeder funds, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Motions to dismiss in these three cases have been granted in part and denied in part. An agreement in principle has been reached, pursuant to which BSAM would pay a maximum of approximately $19 million to settle the one derivative action relating to the feeder fund to the High Grade Fund. BSAM has reserved the right not to proceed with this settlement if plaintiff is unable to secure the participation of investors whose net contributions meet a prescribed percentage of the aggregate net contributions to the High Grade Fund. The agreement in principle remains subject to documentation and approval by the Court. In the other two actions, the parties are engaging in Court-ordered settlement discussions. Discovery has been limited for the duration of that process. Total alleged losses in these three actions exceed $1 billion.The fourth action was brought by Bank of America and Banc of America Securities LLC (together “BofA”) alleging breach of contract and fraud in connection with a May 2007 $4 billion securitization, known as a “CDO-squared,” for which BSAM served as collateral manager. This securitization was composed of certain collateralized debt obligation holdings that were purchased by BofA from the Funds. Bank of America seeks in excess of $3 billion in damages. Defendants’ motion to dismiss in this action was largely denied, an amended complaint was filed and discovery is ongoing.Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters. Various shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Bear Stearns between December 14, 2006, and March 14, 2008 (the “Class Period”). During the Class Period, Bear Stearns had between 115 million and 120 million common shares outstanding, and the price per share of those securities declined from a high of $172.61 to a low of $30 at the end of the period. The actions, originally commenced in several federal courts, allege that the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding Bear Stearns’ business and financial results and that, as a result of those false statements, Bear Stearns’ common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. Separately, several individual shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced or threatened to commence arbitration proceedings and lawsuits asserting claims similar to those in the putative class actions. Certain of these matters have been dismissed or settled. In addition, Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors have also been named as defendants in a number of purported class actions commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to represent the interests of participants in the Bear Stearns Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) during the time period of December 2006 to March 2008. These actions, brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), allege that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs and to the other participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP by (a) failing to manage prudently the ESOP’s investment in Bear Stearns securities; (b) failing to communicate fully and accurately about the risks of the ESOP’s investment in Bear Stearns stock; (c) failing to avoid or address alleged conflicts of interest; and (d) failing to monitor those who managed and administered the ESOP.Bear Stearns, former members of Bear Stearns’ Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns’ former executive officers have also been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative and class action suit which is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securities laws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control and indemnification and contribution in connection with the losses sustained by Bear Stearns as a result of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common stock. Certain individual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of Bear Stearns common stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount.All of the above-described actions filed in federal courts were ordered transferred and joined for pre-trial purposes before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants moved to dismiss the purported securities class action, the shareholders’ derivative action and the ERISA action. In January 2011, the District Court granted the motions to dismiss the derivative and ERISA actions, and denied the motion as to the securities action. Plaintiffs in the derivative action have filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal as well as an appeal. Plaintiffs in the ESOP action have filed a motion to alter the judgment and for leave to amend their amended consolidated complaint. Discovery is ongoing in the securities action.City of Milan Litigation and Criminal Investigation. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the “City”) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (together, “JPMorgan Chase”) in the District Court of Milan. The proceedings relate to (a) a bond issue by the City in June 2005 (the “Bond”), and (b) an associated swap transaction, which was subsequently restructured on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2007 (the “Swap”). The City seeks damages and/or other remedies against JPMorgan Chase (among others) on the grounds of alleged “fraudulent and deceitful acts” and alleged breach of advisory obligations in connection with the Swap and the Bond, together with related swap transactions with other counterparties. The judge has directed four current and former JPMorgan Chase personnel and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 173    N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) to go forward to a full trial that started in May 2010. Although the Firm is not charged with any crime and does not face criminal liability, if one or more of its employees were found guilty, the Firm could be subject to administrative sanctions, including restrictions on its ability to conduct business in Italy and monetary penalties. Hearings have continued on a weekly basis since May 2010.Enron Litigation. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in several lawsuits seeking damages arising out of the Firm’s banking relationships with Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (“Enron”). A number of actions and other proceedings against the Firm previously were resolved, including a class action lawsuit captioned Newby v. Enron Corp. and adversary proceedings brought by Enron’s bankruptcy estate. The remaining Enron-related actions include individual actions by Enron investors, an action by an Enron counterparty, and a purported class action filed on behalf of JPMorgan Chase employees who participated in the Firm’s 401(k) plan asserting claims under the ERISA for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by JPMorgan Chase, its directors and named officers. That action has been dismissed, and is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants has filed a series of putative class action complaints in several federal courts. The complaints allege that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain other banks and their respective bank holding companies, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective association rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief based on the theory that interchange would be lower or eliminated but for the challenged conduct. Based on publicly available estimates, Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards generated approximately $40 billion of interchange fees industry-wide in 2009. All cases have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings. The Court has dismissed all claims relating to periods prior to January 2004. The Court has not yet ruled on motions relating to the remainder of the case or plaintiffs’ class certification motion. Fact and expert discovery have closed.In addition to the consolidated class action complaint, plaintiffs filed supplemental complaints challenging the initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of MasterCard and Visa (the “IPO Complaints”). With respect to the MasterCard IPO, plaintiffs allege that the offering violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act and that the offering was a fraudulent conveyance. With respect to the Visa IPO, plaintiffs are challenging the Visa IPO on antitrust theories parallel to those articulated in the MasterCard IPO pleading. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss the IPO Complaints. The Court has not yet ruled on those motions. The parties also have filed motions seeking summary judgment as to various claims in the complaints.Investment Management Litigation. Four cases have been filed claiming that investment portfolios managed by JPMorgan Investment Management Inc. (“JPMorgan Investment Management”) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by subprime residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs claim that JPMorgan Investment Management and related defendants are liable for losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. The first case was filed by NM Homes One, Inc. in federal District Court in New York. Following rulings on motions addressed to the pleadings, plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and gross negligence survive, and discovery is proceeding. In the second case, which was filed by Assured Guaranty (U.K.) in New York state court, the New York State Appellate Division allowed plaintiff to proceed with its claims for breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence, and for breach of contract based on alleged violations of the Delaware Insurance Code. JPMorgan Investment Management’s appeal is pending in the New York State Court of Appeals. Discovery is also proceeding. In the third case, filed by Ambac Assurance UK Limited in New York state court, the lower court granted JPMorgan Investment Management’s motion to dismiss. The New York State Appellate Division reversed the lower court’s decision and is allowing plaintiff to proceed with its claims. The fourth case was filed by CMMF LLP in New York state court. The amended complaint asserts claims under New York law for breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. The lower court denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss and discovery is proceeding.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $8.6 billion in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI’s bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s collateral requests hastened LBHI’s demise. The Firm has moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint in its entirety. That motion has not yet been decided. The Firm also filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion in claims against the estate of Lehman’s broker-dealer, which could be unpaid if the Firm is required to return any collateral to Lehman. Discovery is underway with a trial scheduled for 2012. In addition, in April 2011 the Firm and the SIPA Trustee for LBHI’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, Lehman Brothers Inc. (“LBI”) announced that they had reached an agreement to return more than $800 million in alleged LBI customer assets to the LBI Estate for distribution to its customer claimants. In late June 2011, the Bankruptcy Court approved the agreement. The Firm has also responded to various regulatory inquiries regarding the Lehman matter.174     Madoff Litigation. JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Securities LLC, and JPMorgan Securities Ltd. have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by the trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (the “Trustee”). The Trustee recently served an amended complaint in which he has asserted 28 causes of action against JPMorgan Chase, 20 of which seek to avoid certain transfers (direct or indirect) made to JPMorgan Chase that are alleged to have been preferential or fraudulent under the federal Bankruptcy Code and the New York Debtor and Creditor Law. The remaining causes of action are for, among other things, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The complaint generally alleges that JPMorgan Chase, as Madoff’s long-time bank, facilitated the maintenance of Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and overlooked signs of wrongdoing in order to obtain profits and fees. The complaint purports to seek approximately $19 billion in damages from JPMorgan Chase, and to recover approximately $425 million in transfers that JPMorgan Chase allegedly received directly or indirectly from Bernard Madoff’s brokerage firm. JPMorgan Chase’s motion to return the case from the Bankruptcy Court to the District Court was granted in May 2011 and JPMorgan Chase has moved to dismiss most of the Trustee’s claims.Separately, J.P. Morgan Trust Company (Cayman) Limited, JPMorgan (Suisse) SA, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., and Bear Stearns Alternative Assets International Ltd. have been named as defendants in several suits in Bankruptcy Court and state and federal courts in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, “Fairfield”), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions advanced theories of mistake and restitution and sought to recover payments previously made to defendants by the funds totaling approximately $140 million. Fairfield and the Madoff Trustee reached an agreement pursuant to which the complaints against Cayman, Suisse, and JP Morgan Securities Ltd. will be dismissed and that agreement has been approved by the court.In addition, a purported class action is pending against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as is a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. to an already-pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The JPMorgan Chase entities have moved to dismiss these actions.Finally, JPMorgan Chase is a defendant in five actions pending in the New York state court and one individual action in federal court in New York. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. In the federal action, the Firm prevailed on its motion to dismiss before the District Court, and that decision was recently affirmed on appeal. In the state court actions, the Firm’s motion to dismiss has been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting the court’s decision. The Firm is also responding to various governmental inquiries concerning the Madoff matter.Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation and Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates, Bear Stearns and affiliates and Washington Mutual affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles as issuer or underwriter in mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) offerings. These cases include purported class action suits, actions by individual purchasers of securities, actions by insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches and an action by a trustee. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the offering documents for more than $160 billion of securities issued by dozens of securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including statements regarding the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination.In the actions against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter of its own MBS offerings), three purported class actions are pending against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, and/or certain of their affiliates and current and former employees, in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Defendants moved to dismiss these actions. One of those motions has been granted in part to dismiss claims relating to all but one of the offerings. The other two motions remain pending. In addition, Washington Mutual affiliates, WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. and WaMu Capital Corp., along with certain former officers or directors of WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp., have been named as defendants in three now-consolidated purported class action cases pending in the Western District of Washington. Defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted in part to dismiss all claims relating to MBS offerings in which a named plaintiff was not a purchaser. Defendants have since moved for judgment on the pleadings as to all claims relating to all MBS Certificates of which a named plaintiff was not a purchaser. Plaintiffs have sought leave to amend their complaint to add JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as a defendant on the theory that it is a successor to Washington Mutual Bank. The Firm has opposed this request. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification, which defendants have opposed. Discovery is ongoing.In other actions brought against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter) certain JPMorgan Chase entities, several Bear Stearns entities, and certain Washington Mutual affiliates are defendants in ten separate individual actions commenced by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Indianapolis, Atlanta and Boston in various state courts around the country; and certain JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual entities are also among the defendants named in separate individual actions commenced by various institutional investors in federal and state courts.175    EMC Mortgage Corporation (“EMC”), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and certain other JPMorgan Chase entities are defendants in six pending actions commenced by bond insurers that guaranteed payments of principal and interest on approximately $3.6 billion of certain classes of seven different MBS offerings sponsored by EMC. Two of those actions, commenced by Assured Guaranty Corp. and Syncora Guarantee, Inc., respectively, are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Syncora has also filed an action in New York state court alleging tort claims against arising out of the same transaction as its original federal complaint. The fourth action, filed by Ambac Assurance Corporation, was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds by the United States District for the Southern District of New York. The dismissal is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ambac has also filed a nearly identical complaint in New York state court. The sixth action, commenced by CIFG Assurance North America, Inc., is pending in state court in Texas, but Defendants have filed a motion arguing that New York is the superior forum. In most of the actions, the plaintiff claims that the underlying mortgage loans had origination defects that purportedly violate certain representations and warranties given by EMC to plaintiffs, and that EMC has breached the relevant agreements between the parties by failing to repurchase allegedly defective mortgage loans. In addition, the Ambac, CIFG and Syncora complaints allege fraudulent inducement and tortious interference, though tortious interference was dismissed from the Ambac federal action immediately before the jurisdictional dismissal. Each action seeks unspecified damages and, except in the Syncora state complaint, an order compelling EMC to repurchase those loans. The CIFG complaint also seeks punitive damages.In the actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers, but those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now defunct, such as affiliates of IndyMac Bancorp (“IndyMac Trusts”) and Thornburg Mortgage (“Thornburg”). With respect to the IndyMac Trusts, JPMorgan Securities, along with numerous other underwriters and individuals, is named as a defendant, both in its own capacity and as successor to Bear Stearns in a purported class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of purchasers of securities in various IndyMac Trust MBS offerings. The court in that action has dismissed claims as to certain such securitizations, including all offerings in which no named plaintiff purchased securities, and allowed claims as to other offerings to proceed. Plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class of investors in certain offerings is pending, and discovery is ongoing. In addition, JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Chase are named as defendants in an individual action filed by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh in connection with a single offering by an affiliate of IndyMac Bancorp. Discovery in that action is ongoing. Separately, JPMorgan Securities, as successor to Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., along with other underwriters and certain individuals, are defendants in an action pending in state court in California brought by MBIA Insurance Corp. (“MBIA”). The action relates to certain securities issued by IndyMac trusts in offerings in which Bear Stearns was an underwriter, and as to which MBIA provided guaranty insurance policies. MBIA purports to be subrogated to the rights of the MBS holders, and seeks recovery of sums it has paid and will pay pursuant to those policies. Discovery is ongoing. With respect to Thornburg, a Bear Stearns subsidiary is also a named defendant in a purported class action pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico along with a number of other financial institutions that served as depositors and/or underwriters for three Thornburg MBS offerings. Defendants have moved to dismiss this action.A shareholder complaint has been filed in New York state court against the Firm and two affiliates, members of the boards of directors thereof and certain employees asserting claims based on alleged wrongful actions and inactions relating to residential mortgage originations and securitizations. The action seeks an accounting and damages.In addition to the above-described litigation, the Firm has also received, and responded to, a number of subpoenas and informal requests for information from federal and state authorities concerning mortgage-related matters, including inquiries concerning a number of transactions involving the Firm’s origination and purchase of whole loans, underwriting and issuance of MBS, treatment of early payment defaults and potential breaches of securitization representations and warranties, due diligence in connection with securitizations and the Firm’s participation in offerings of certain collateralized debt obligations.JPMorgan Securities has resolved the investigation by the SEC’s Division of Enforcement regarding certain collateralized debt obligations.In addition to the above mortgage-related matters, the Firm is a defendant in an action commenced by Deutsche Bank, described in more detail below with respect to the Washington Mutual Litigations. Mortgage Foreclosure Investigations and Litigation. Multiple state and federal officials have announced investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates, relating to servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation processes. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations, and these investigations could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, as well as significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve have issued Consent Orders as to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase & Co., respectively. In their Orders, the regulators have mandated significant changes to the Firm’s servicing and default business and outlined requirements to implement these changes. Included in these requirements is the retention of an independent consultant to conduct an independent review of (and reimbursement of borrowers who sustained economic harm from) residential foreclosure actions or proceedings for loans serviced by the Firm that have been pending at any time from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010, as well as residential foreclosure sales that occurred during this time period. These 176    regulators have reserved the right to impose civil monetary penalties at a later date. Investigations by other state and federal authorities remain pending. Though the Firm has been in discussions with state and federal authorities about a potential global settlement of claims, there can be no assurance that any resolution will be reached.Four purported class action lawsuits have also been filed against the Firm relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. Additionally, the Firm is defending a purported class action brought against Bank of America involving an EMC loan. One of the cases has been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice by the plaintiff. The Firm has moved to dismiss two of the remaining cases. In the fourth case, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Firm will move to dismiss.A shareholder derivative action has been filed in New York state court against the Firm’s board of directors alleging that the board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. The action seeks a declaratory judgment and damages.As of January 2011, the Firm had resumed initiation of new foreclosure proceedings in nearly all states in which it had previously suspended such proceedings, utilizing revised procedures in connection with the execution of affidavits and other documents used by Firm employees in the foreclosure process. The Firm is also in the process of reviewing pending foreclosure matters to determine whether remediation of specific documentation is necessary, and is resuming pending foreclosures as the review, and if necessary, remediation, of each pending matter is completed. Municipal Derivatives Investigations and Litigation. The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) (in conjunction with the Internal Revenue Service), the Securities and Exchange Commission, a group of state attorneys general, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York investigated the Firm for possible antitrust, securities and tax-related violations in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteed investment contracts and derivatives to municipal issuers. In July 2011, the Firm reached settlements with all of the government agencies to resolve these investigations. The settlements cover conduct in or prior to 2006. Under the terms of the settlements, the Firm entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ, and will pay a net amount of $211 million to the other government agencies. The Firm also agreed to implement measures to strengthen board oversight and compliance risk management programs relating to certain types of transactions.Purported class action lawsuits and individual actions (the “Municipal Derivatives Actions”) have been filed against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, as well as numerous other providers and brokers, alleging antitrust violations in the reportedly $100 billion to $300 billion annual market for financial instruments related to municipal bond offerings referred to collectively as “municipal derivatives.” The Municipal Derivatives Actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court denied in part and granted in part defendants’ motions to dismiss the purported class and individual actions, permitting certain claims to proceed against the Firm and others under federal and California state antitrust laws and under the California false claims act. Subsequently, a number of additional individual actions asserting substantially similar claims, including claims under New York and West Virginia state antitrust statutes, were filed against JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and numerous other defendants. All of these cases have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Discovery is ongoing.Following J.P. Morgan Securities’ November 4, 2009, settlement with the SEC in connection with certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions, various parties have brought civil litigation against the Firm. The County and a putative class of sewer rate payers have filed complaints against the Firm and several other defendants in Alabama state court. The suits allege that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and chosen as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The complaints also allege that the Firm concealed these third-party payments and that, but for this concealment, the County would not have entered into the transactions. The Court denied the Firm’s motions to dismiss the complaints in both proceedings. The Firm filed a mandamus petition with the Alabama Supreme Court, seeking immediate appellate review of this decision. The mandamus petition in the County’s lawsuit was denied in April 2011. The mandamus petition in the lawsuit brought by sewer ratepayers remains pending.Separately, two insurance companies that guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on warrants issued by Jefferson County have filed separate actions against the Firm in New York state court. Their complaints assert that the Firm fraudulently misled them into issuing insurance based upon substantially the same alleged conduct described above and other alleged non-disclosures. One insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of nearly $1.2 billion and seeks unspecified damages in excess of $400 million, as well as unspecified punitive damages. The other insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of more than $378 million and seeks recovery of $4 million allegedly paid under the policies to date as well as any future payments and unspecified punitive damages. In December 2010, the court denied the Firm’s motions to dismiss each of the complaints. Discovery is proceeding.Overdraft Fee/Debit Posting Order Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been named as a defendant in several purported class actions relating to its practices in posting debit card transactions to customers’ deposit accounts. Plaintiffs allege that the Firm improperly re-ordered debit card transactions from the highest amount to lowest amount before processing these transactions in order to generate unwarranted overdraft fees. Plaintiffs contend that the Firm should have processed such transactions in the 177    chronological order they were authorized. Plaintiffs seek the disgorgement of all overdraft fees paid to the Firm by plaintiffs since approximately 2003 as a result of the re-ordering of debit card transactions. The claims against the Firm have been consolidated with numerous complaints against other national banks in Multi-District Litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Firm’s motion to compel arbitration of certain plaintiffs’ claims was denied by the District Court. That ruling is currently on appeal. Discovery is proceeding in the District Court.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain entities affiliated with Petters (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by the court appointed receiver in the civil action filed by the federal government against Petters and the trustees in the bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities, and generally seek to avoid, on fraudulent transfer and preference grounds, certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition of Polaroid by Petters, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees and have also sought to transfer those actions to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, where the receiver’s action is pending.Securities Lending Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been named as a defendant in four putative class actions asserting ERISA and other claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought by participants in the Firm’s securities lending business. A fifth lawsuit was filed in New York state court by an individual participant in the program. Three of the purported class actions, which have been consolidated, relate to investments of approximately $500 million in medium-term notes of Sigma Finance Inc. (“Sigma”). In August 2010, the Court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all securities lending participants that held Sigma medium-term notes on September 30, 2008, including those that held the notes by virtue of participation in the investment of cash collateral through a collective fund, as well as those that held the notes by virtue of the investment of cash collateral through individual accounts. All discovery has been completed. JPMorgan Chase has moved for partial summary judgment as to plaintiffs’ duty of loyalty claim, in which it is alleged that the Firm created an impermissible conflict of interest by providing repurchase financing to Sigma while also holding Sigma medium-term notes in securities lending accounts. The fourth putative class action concerns investments of approximately $500 million in Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Firm has moved to dismiss the amended complaint and is awaiting a decision. Discovery is proceeding while the motion is pending. The New York state court action, which is not a class action, concerns the plaintiff’s alleged loss of money in both Sigma and Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Firm has answered the complaint. Discovery is proceeding.Service Members Civil Relief Act and Housing and Economic Recovery Act Investigations and Litigation. Multiple government officials have announced inquiries into the Firm’s procedures related to the Service Members Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”) and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (“HERA”). These inquiries have been prompted by the Firm’s public statements about its SCRA and HERA compliance and actions to remedy certain instances in which the Firm mistakenly charged active or recently-active military personnel mortgage interest and fees in excess of that permitted by SCRA and HERA, and in a number of instances, foreclosed on borrowers protected by SCRA and HERA. The Firm has implemented a number of procedural enhancements and controls to strengthen its SCRA and HERA compliance. In addition, an individual borrower filed a nationwide class action in United States District Court for South Carolina against the Firm alleging violations of the SCRA related to home loans. The Firm agreed to pay $27 million plus attorneys’ fees, in addition to reimbursements previously paid by the Firm, to settle the class action. The settlement has received preliminary approval by the court and is subject to final court approval.Washington Mutual Litigations. Subsequent to JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) of substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual Bank”) in September 2008, Washington Mutual Bank’s parent holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc. (“WMI”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp. (together, the “Debtors”), both commenced voluntary cases under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Case”). In the Bankruptcy Case, the Debtors have asserted rights and interests in certain assets. The assets in dispute include principally the following: (a) approximately $4 billion in trust securities contributed by WMI to Washington Mutual Bank (the “Trust Securities”); (b) the right to tax refunds arising from overpayments attributable to operations of Washington Mutual Bank and its subsidiaries; (c) ownership of and other rights in approximately $4 billion that WMI contends are deposit accounts at Washington Mutual Bank and one of its subsidiaries; and (d) ownership of and rights in various other contracts and other assets (collectively, the “Disputed Assets”).WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC have since been involved in litigations over these and other claims pending in the Bankruptcy Court and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.178    In May 2010, WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC announced a global settlement agreement among themselves and significant creditor groups (the “Global Settlement Agreement”). The Global Settlement Agreement is incorporated into WMI’s proposed Chapter 11 plan (“the Plan”) that has been submitted to the Bankruptcy Court. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Global Settlement would resolve numerous disputes among WMI, JPMorgan Chase, the FDIC in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank and the FDIC in its corporate capacity, as well as those of significant creditor groups, including disputes relating to the Disputed Assets.The Bankruptcy Court considered confirmation of the Plan, including the Global Settlement Agreement, in hearings in early December 2010. In early January 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion in which it concluded that the Global Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable, but that the Plan cannot be confirmed until the parties correct certain deficiencies, which include the scope of releases. None of these deficiencies relates to the Disputed Assets. The Equity Committee, which represents shareholders of WMI, has filed a petition seeking a direct appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from so much of the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling that found the settlement to be fair and reasonable. A revised Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court in February 2011. The Bankruptcy Court concluded the evidentiary portion of the confirmation hearings for the revised Plan in July 2011. Oral argument is scheduled for August 24, 2011. If the Court ultimately confirms the Plan and the Global Settlement becomes effective, then the Firm currently estimates it will not incur net additional liabilities beyond those already reflected in its balance sheet for the numerous disputes covered by the Global Settlement.Other proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are also pending before the Bankruptcy Court. Among other actions, in July 2010, certain holders of the Trust Securities commenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase, WMI, and other entities seeking, among other relief, a declaratory judgment that WMI and JPMorgan Chase do not have any right, title or interest in the Trust Securities. In early January 2011, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment to JPMorgan Chase and denied summary judgment to the plaintiffs in the Trust Securities adversary proceeding. Other proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain WMI subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities relating to the mortgage securitization agreements. In April 2011, the District Court denied as premature motions by the Firm and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank’s claims. Discovery is underway.In addition, JPMorgan Chase was sued in an action originally filed in State Court in Texas (the “Texas Action”) by certain holders of WMI common stock and debt of WMI and Washington Mutual Bank who seek unspecified damages alleging that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at an allegedly too-low price. The Texas Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which ultimately granted JPMorgan Chase’s and the FDIC’s motions to dismiss the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed this dismissal and on June 24, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the trial court’s dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings.* * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm incurred litigation expense of $1.9 billion and $792 million, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2011, and 2010, and $3.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.179     NOTE 24 – BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are six major reportable business segments - Investment Bank, Retail Financial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking, Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management, as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see the footnotes to the table below. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business Segment Results on pages 17–18 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 67–68 and Note 34 on pages 290–293 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. Segment results The following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This approach allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).Effective January 1, 2011, capital allocated to CS was reduced, largely reflecting portfolio runoff and the improving risk profile of the business; capital allocated to TSS was increased, reflecting growth in the underlying business. The Firm continues to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Segment results and reconciliation(a)                                   Three months ended June 30, 2011 (in millions, except ratios) InvestmentBank

on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s lines of business results on a “managed basis,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications as discussed below that do not have any impact on net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole.      (b) IB manages traditional credit exposures related to the Global Corporate Bank (“GCB”) on behalf of IB and TSS. Effective January 1, 2011, IB and TSS share the economics related to the Firm’s GCB clients. Included within this allocation are net revenues, provision for credit losses, as well as expenses. Prior-year period reflected a reimbursement to IB for a portion of the total costs of managing the credit portfolio. IB recognizes this credit allocation as a component of all other income.      (c) Segment managed results reflect revenue on a fully tax-equivalent basis, with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results. Tax-equivalent adjustments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, were as follows.

These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements, for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 28, 2011, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

The borrower receives written or oral advice of this facility. The Firm may cancel this facility at any time.Allowance for loan losses to total loans: Represents period-end allowance for loan losses divided by retained loans.Assets under management: Represent assets actively managed by AM on behalf of Private Banking, Institutional and Retail clients. Includes “Committed capital not Called,” on which AM earns fees. Excludes assets managed by American Century Companies, Inc., in which the Firm has a 40% ownership interest as of June 30, 2011.Assets under supervision: Represent assets under management as well as custody, brokerage, administration and deposit accounts.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt/equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates. The underlying obligations of the VIEs consist of short-term borrowings, commercial paper and long-term debt. The related assets consist of trading assets, available-for-sale securities, loans and other assets.Contractual credit card charge-off: In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification about a specific event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower), whichever is earlier.Corporate/Private Equity: Includes Private Equity, Treasury and Chief Investment Office, and Corporate Other, which includes other centrally managed expense and discontinued operations. Credit derivatives: Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency or failure to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e. Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number identifies most securities, including: stocks of all registered U.S. and Canadian companies, and U.S. government and municipal bonds. The CUSIP system – owned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s – facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities. The number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security. A similar system is used to identify foreign securities (CUSIP International Numbering System).Deposit margin: Represents net interest income expressed as a percentage of average deposits.FASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board. FDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk provided by credit bureaus, typically produced from statistical models by Fair Isaac Corporation utilizing data collected by the credit bureaus.Forward points: Represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., “spot rate”) to determine the forward exchange rate.Global Corporate Bank: TSS and IB formed a joint venture to create the Firm’s Global Corporate Bank. With a team of bankers, the Global Corporate Bank serves multinational clients by providing them access to TSS products and services and certain IB products, including derivatives, foreign exchange and debt. The cost of this effort and the credit that the Firm extends to these clients is shared between TSS and IB.Headcount-related expense: Includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.IASB: International Accounting Standards Board.Interchange income: A fee paid to a credit card issuer in the clearing and settlement of a sales or cash advance transaction.Interests in purchased receivables: Represents an ownership interest in cash flows of an underlying pool of receivables transferred by a third-party seller into a bankruptcy-remote entity, generally a trust.Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment system. “Investment grade” generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a “BBB-”/ “Baa3” or better, as defined by independent rating agencies.186    LLC: Limited Liability Company.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Origination date LTV ratioThe LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the MSA level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all lien positions related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Mark-to-market exposure: A measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When the MTM value is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes JPMorgan Chase and, therefore, creates credit risk for the Firm. When the MTM value is negative, JPMorgan Chase owes the counterparty; in this situation, the Firm has liquidity risk.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.Mortgage product types:Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined-loan-to-value (“CLTV”) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. Perhaps the most important characteristic is limited documentation. A substantial proportion of traditional Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans generally have low default risk and are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.Subprime Subprime loans are designed for customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. 187    MSR risk management revenue: Includes changes in the fair value of the MSR asset due to market-based inputs, such as interest rates and volatility, as well as updates to assumptions used in the MSR valuation model; and derivative valuation adjustments and other, which represents changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to offset the impact of changes in the market-based inputs to the MSR valuation model.Multi-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class (e.g., long-term fixed income, equity, cash, real assets, private equity or hedge funds).NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. Net charge-off rate: Represents net charge-offs (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NM: Not meaningful. OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefits. Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.Personal bankers: Retail branch office personnel who acquire, retain and expand new and existing customer relationships by assessing customer needs and recommending and selling appropriate banking products and services. Portfolio activity: Describes changes to the risk profile of existing lending-related exposures and their impact on the allowance for credit losses from changes in customer profiles and inputs used to estimate the allowances. Pre-provision profit: Pre-provision profit is total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Pretax margin: Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors.Principal transactions: Realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities (including physical commodities inventories that are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value) and changes in fair value associated with financial instruments held predominantly by IB for which the fair value option was elected. Principal transactions revenue also includes private equity gains and losses.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Acquired loans deemed to be credit-impaired under the FASB guidance for PCI loans. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., FICO score, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Wholesale loans are determined to be credit-impaired if they meet the definition of an impaired loan under U.S. GAAP at the acquisition date. Consumer loans are determined to be credit-impaired based on specific risk characteristics of the loan, including product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, and past due status.Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the wholesale lines of business.Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”): Risk-weighted assets consist of on-and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-188    balance sheet assets. RWA also incorporate a measure for the market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total RWA.Sales specialists: Retail branch office personnel who specialize in the marketing of a single product, including mortgages, investments and business banking, by partnering with the personal bankers.Stress testing: A scenario that measures market risk under unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets.Taxable-equivalent basis: Total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to fully taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): Occurs when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.

Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as 191    large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies – or even material weaknesses – in internal controls in the future. For further information, see Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting on page 158 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2011, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.192     Part II Other InformationItem 1 Legal ProceedingsFor information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part 1, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in the Firm’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, see the discussion of the Firm’s material litigation in Note 23 on pages 172–179 of this Form 10-Q.Item 1A Risk Factors The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors, on pages 5–12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion of Risk Factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s business and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject, including recently adopted legislation and regulations.JPMorgan Chase is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations affect the way the Firm does business, may restrict the scope of its existing businesses, limit its ability to expand its product offerings or pursue acquisitions, or make offering its products and services more expensive.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, will significantly increase the regulation of the financial services industry. This legislation, among other things: establishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which will have broad authority to regulate the credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services that the Firm offers; establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) to oversee systemic risk, and provides regulators with the power to require such companies deemed “systemically important” to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the United States; increases regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market by requiring central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, and imposing heightened supervision of over-the-counter derivatives dealers and major market participants; imposes margin requirements on derivative transactions that could significantly reduce customer appetite for such products and, if applied abroad, could significantly reduce our ability to compete against foreign bank competitors in this and associated businesses; through so-called “push out” provisions, requires the Firm to significantly restructure its derivatives businesses or limit the Firm’s ability to manage collateral, margin and other risks; prohibits the Firm from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities and restricts its ownership of, investment in or sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds (commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”); restricts the interchange fees that the Firm earns on debit card transactions (commonly referred to as the “Durbin Amendment”); requires bank regulators to phase out the treatment of trust preferred capital debt securities as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes; requires loan originators and sponsors retain at least a certain percentage of the credit risk of certain securitized exposures (referred to as “risk retention” or “skin in the game”); and requires the Firm to provide a credible plan for resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, and provides sanctions that include divestiture of assets or restructuring in the event the Firm’s plan is deemed insufficient.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) announced in December 2010 revisions to its Capital Accord (commonly referred to as “Basel III”), which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition of capital, expand the definition of risk-weighted assets, and introduce short term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things.The European Union (“EU”) has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stability. In addition, the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (“G-20”) broadened the membership and scope of the Financial Stability Forum in 2008 to form the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”). These institutions, charged with developing ways to promote cross-border financial stability, are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of these proposals include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures; compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries; and capital surcharges on, and resolution of, globally systemically important firms.In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the FSB proposed that banks that are systemically important on a global basis be required to maintain additional capital above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum, in amounts raging from 1% to 2.5%, depending upon the bank’s “systemic importance.” The announcement also noted that a possible additional 1% capital charge would be applied to banks that “increase materially their global systemic importance in the future.” This is designed to provide a disincentive for banks to increase their systemic importance.193    Based on the Firm’s current understanding of these new capital requirements, the Firm expects it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective. However, compliance with these capital standards, as well as compliance with the liquidity coverage standards that may be implemented in the future, may adversely affect the Firm’s operational or funding costs, reduce its return on equity, or cause the Firm to increase prices on, or alter the types of, products it offers to its customers and clients, thereby causing the Firm’s products to become less attractive or placing the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions that are not subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements.In June 2011, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules implementing the “Durbin Amendment” provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits the amount the Firm can charge for each debit card transaction it processes. As a result, the Firm currently believes aggregate annualized gross revenue for Retail Banking may be reduced by approximately $1 billion per year. Although the Firm is currently considering various actions it may take to mitigate such anticipated declines in revenue, it is unlikely that any such actions would wholly offset the loss of revenue.In the United States, the Department of the Treasury, FSOC, SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve Board, OCC, CFPB and FDIC are engaged in extensive rule-making mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. While certain regulations under Dodd-Frank have been adopted, much of the significant rule-making remains to be done. As a result, the complete scope of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain. For example, until further implementing regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted, the precise definition of prohibited “proprietary trading”, the scope of any exceptions for market making and hedging, and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund activities remains unknown. Based on the Firm’s current understanding and interpretation of the Volcker Rule, the Firm does not believe the application of the Volcker Rule to the Firm’s activities will have a significant material effect on the Firm’s results of operations or result in a material disruption to the Firm’s businesses or opportunities. However, it is possible that the scope of the final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule will be broader or more stringent than currently anticipated. The Firm is also unable at this time to quantify the possible effects on its business and operations of many of the other significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including, but not limited to those provisions related to the trading and settlement of derivatives and the extent to which the CFPB will mandate changes in consumer products and practices. Accordingly, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and its precise implications to the Firm’s activities and businesses remains indeterminate.In addition, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will respond to such legislation, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S laws and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the Firm. There is no assurance that additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the EU or in other countries, would not result in a significant loss of revenue, limit the Firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses. Accordingly, the Firm cannot provide assurance that any such new or additional legislation or regulations would not have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.Further, if the Firm does not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its operations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties or material restrictions on its businesses, as well as associated reputational damage. In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with the Firm’s operations. As this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect the Firm’s operations and, in turn, its financial results. Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
