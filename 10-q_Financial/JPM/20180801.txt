(“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments, refer to Note 23.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly presented.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.For a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation, refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Application of U.S. GAAP related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and the Firm recorded the estimated impact of the deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings and the remeasurement of deferred taxes under the TCJA. These provisional amounts represent estimates under SEC guidance, which provides a one-year measurement period in which to refine the estimates based on new information or the issuance of interpretative guidance. Based on legislative clarifications published during the second quarter of 2018, which were specific to the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings, the Firm recorded a tax benefit of $189 million. The Firm has made and continues to anticipate refinements to both calculations as a result of the issuance of additional legislative and accounting guidance as well as those in the normal course of business, including true-ups to the tax liability on the tax return as filed and the resolution of tax audits. The Firm considers any legislative or accounting guidance issued as of the balance sheet date when evaluating potential refinements to these estimates. 89Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2018The following table identifies the standards adopted, and the note where further information on the impact of the new guidance can be found:Revenue recognition – revenue from contracts with customersNote 5Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilitiesNotes 2 and 9Treatment of restricted cash on the statement of cash flowsNote 18 Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costNote 7Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securitiesNotes 9 and 17Hedge accountingNotes 4, 9 and 17Reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCINote 17 Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and prior period amounts were revised accordingly. The most significant of the new standards was revenue recognition, which requires gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change resulted in noninterest revenue and noninterest expense each increasing by $261 million and $525 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, with no impact to net income. Upon adoption of the restricted cash guidance, to align the Consolidated balance sheets with the Consolidated statements of cash flows, the Firm reclassified restricted cash into cash and due from banks or deposits with banks. In addition, for the Firm’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks. This guidance was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised, resulting in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increasing by $71 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, and other assets decreasing by $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. 90Note 2 – Fair value measurementFor a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.91The following table presents the assets and liabilities

respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included within trading loans were $14.8 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $5.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $9.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of zero and $836 million respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying 93value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, refer to Note 4. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.(f)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $764 million and $779 million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, were trading assets of $50 million and $54 million, respectively, and other assets of $714 million and $725 million, respectively.(g)Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted the recognition and measurement guidance. Equity securities that were previously reported as AFS securities were reclassified to other assets upon adoption. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fairvalue on a recurring basis For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 there were no individually significant transfers. All transfers are based on changes in the observability of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Level 3 valuations For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.  In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at June 30, 2018, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range; equity correlation, equity-FX, and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate, yield and prepayment speed inputs used in estimating fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads and conditional default rates were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; loss severity and price inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range.  94Level 3 inputs(a)      June 30, 2018      Product/InstrumentFair value(in millions) Principal valuation techniqueUnobservable inputs(g)Range of input valuesWeighted average Residential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b)$798 Discounted cash flowsYield0 %–23% 6%   Prepayment speed0 %–50% 8%    Conditional default rate0 %–20% 1%    Loss severity0 %–100% 6%Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c)445 Market comparablesPrice$6–$101 $91Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities736 Market comparablesPrice$59–$100 $97Corporate debt securities274 Market comparablesPrice$2–$107 $82Loans(d)1,486 Market comparablesPrice$4–$104 $87Asset-backed securities147 Discounted cash flowsCredit spread216 bps 216 bps    Prepayment speed20% 20%    Conditional default rate2% 2%    Loss severity30% 30% 87 Market comparablesPrice$4–$100 $59Net interest rate derivatives293 Option pricingInterest rate spread volatility16 bps–38 bps     Interest rate correlation(50)%–97%      IR-FX correlation55 %–60%   196 Discounted cash flowsPrepayment speed0 %–30%  Net credit derivatives(27) Discounted cash flowsCredit correlation35 %–65%      Credit spread8 bps–1,497 bps      Recovery rate20 %–70%      Yield1 %–36%      Prepayment speed0 %–18%      Conditional default rate0 %–93%      Loss severity0 %–100%   3 Market comparablesPrice$10–$98  Net foreign exchange derivatives(62) Option pricingIR-FX correlation(50)%–60%   (183) Discounted cash flowsPrepayment speed8 %–9%  Net equity derivatives(2,578) Option pricingEquity volatility10 %–60%      Equity correlation10 %–95%      Equity-FX correlation(70)%–60%      Equity-IR correlation20 %–40%  Net commodity derivatives(752) Option pricingForward commodity price$52–$ 80 per barrel    Commodity volatility5 %–53%      Commodity correlation(52)%–95%  MSRs6,241 Discounted cash flowsRefer to Note 14  Other assets289 Discounted cash flowsCredit spread70 bps 70 bps    Yield8 %–10% 8% 1,342 Market comparablesPrice$35–$104 $46    EBITDA multiple3.0x–8.4x 8.0xLong-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e)24,776 Option pricingInterest rate spread volatility16 bps–38 bps    Interest rate correlation(50)%–97%     IR-FX correlation(50)%–60%     Equity correlation10 %–95%     Equity-FX correlation(70)%–60%     Equity-IR correlation20 %–40%  Other level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f)419        (a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.(b)Includes U.S. government agency securities of $471 million, nonagency securities of $88 million and trading loans of $239 million.(c)Includes U.S. government agency securities of $7 million, nonagency securities of $18 million, trading loans of $261 million and non-trading loans of $159 million.(d)Comprises trading loans.(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(f)Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.95Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall  fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments. 96 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  Three months ended June 30, 2018(in millions)Fair value at April 1, 2018Total realized/unrealized

These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 13% to 40% with a weighted average of 22%.(b)Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative) as a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance. Of the $823 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2018, $641 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.There were no material liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2018 and 2017.Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, related to financial instruments held at those dates.

Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. (a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, refer to Valuation hierarchy on pages 156–159 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. (b)The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, refer to page 157 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Equity securities without readily determinable fair values As a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance and the election of the measurement alternative in the first quarter of 2018, the Firm measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of June 30, 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $10.9 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(225) million and $(76) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, and Note 20 of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe following table presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.June 30, 2018December 31, 2017(in millions)Long-term debtShort-term borrowingsDepositsTotalLong-term debtShort-term borrowingsDepositsTotalRisk exposureInterest rate$22,895$120$8,352$31,367$22,056$69$8,058$30,183Credit3,9761,134—5,1104,3291,312—5,641Foreign exchange2,80191392,9312,841147383,026Equity19,6886,9696,89133,54817,5817,1066,54831,235Commodity259132,2562,528230154,4684,713Total structured notes$49,619$8,327$17,538$75,484$47,037$8,649$19,112$74,798107Note 4 – Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. Derivatives designated as hedges The adoption of the new hedge accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 better aligns hedge accounting with the economics of the Firm’s risk management activities. For additional information, refer to Note 17. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or  cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For qualifying fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings through an amortization approach over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings. 108The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: •collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. •the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and •collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers(in millions)June 30, 2018December 31, 2017Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables$10,796$11,916Collateral posted9,0669,973The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at June 30, 2018 was not material, and there were no such transfers at December 31, 2017.114Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of incomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(e)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.(f)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Under the new hedge accounting guidance, the initial amount of the excluded components may be amortized into income over the life of the derivative, or changes in fair value may be recognized in current period earnings.(g)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.115As of June 30, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to impact the income statement in future periods (e.g., as adjustments to yield or to securities gains/losses).

As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Given the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges generally will not impact the income statement in future periods. The carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is $15.4 billion and for long-term debt is $7.2 billion.(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.(d)Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date. 116Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.(c)Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(54) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2018, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which  forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately five years. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 117Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 2018 2017Three months ended June 30, (in millions)Amounts recorded in income(a)(c)Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(c)Amounts recorded in OCI(b)Foreign exchange derivatives $4 $1,204  $(50) $(319)           2018 2017Six months ended June 30, (in millions)Amounts recorded in income(a)(c)Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(c)Amounts recorded in OCI(b)Foreign exchange derivatives $(7) $815  $(112) $(828)(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on net investment hedges directly in income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. (c)Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. For additional information, refer to Note 17. Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue. 118Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

The adoption of the revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018, requires gross presentation of certain costs previously offset against revenue, predominantly associated with certain distribution costs (previously offset against asset management, administration and commissions), with the remainder associated with certain underwriting costs (previously offset against investment banking fees). Adoption of the guidance did not result in any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition. This guidance was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, which resulted in an increase in both noninterest revenue and noninterest expense.

This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making activities. Refer to Note 6 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.

Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At June 30, 2018, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.As a result of the adoption of the premium amortization accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, premiums  on purchased callable debt securities must be amortized to the earliest call date for debt securities with call features that are explicit, noncontingent and callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. The guidance primarily impacts obligations of U.S. states and municipalities held in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. For additional information, refer to Note 17.As permitted by the new hedge accounting guidance, the Firm also elected to transfer U.S. government agency MBS, commercial MBS, and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $22.4 billion from HTM to AFS in the first quarter of 2018. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. For additional information, refer to Note 17.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.

The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of June 30, 2018, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of June 30, 2018, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)Includes investment securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 7 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.127Note 10 – Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, refer to Note 3. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, refer to Note 21.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances  outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces the economic exposure with the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented below, if the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.

There were $4.1 billion and $3.0 billion of securities borrowed at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value in either period.(c)In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related asset or liability with that counterparty.(d)Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, included $5.2 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $30.0 billion and $25.5 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $13.4 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively, of securities sold under agreements to repurchase; and $50 million and $29 million, respectively, of securities loaned and other. 128The tables below present as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.129Note 11 – LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans •Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair value•PCI loans held-for-investment For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f)Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Residential mortgage(b)• Home equity(c)Other consumer loans(d)• Auto• Consumer & Business Banking(e)Residential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other(g)(a)Includes loans held in CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate.(b)Predominantly includes prime (including option ARMs) and subprime loans.(c)Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans.(d)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.(e)Predominantly includes Business Banking loans.(f)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.(g)Includes loans to: individuals (predominantly Wealth Management clients within AWM), SPEs, and private education and civic organizations. For more information on SPEs, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

These amounts were not material as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.130The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table.   2018 2017Three months ended June 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotal Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotalPurchases $532(a)(b) $—$532$1,064 $626(a)(b) $—$594$1,220Sales 2,391—4,9437,334 763 —2,3773,140Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale — —392392 31—307338                 2018 2017Six months ended June 30, (in millions)  Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotal Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotalPurchases  $1,603(a)(b) $—$1,630$3,233 $1,566(a)(b) $—$878$2,444Sales  2,872 —8,63211,504 1,353 —4,8246,177Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale  36 —1,2601,296 6,340(c) —7687,108(a)Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines.

Such purchases were $5.3 billion and $5.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $8.9 billion and $11.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(c)Includes the Firm’s student loan portfolio which was sold in 2017.Gains and losses on sales of loansGains and losses on sales of loans (including adjustments to record loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in other income were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. In addition, the sale of loans may result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market.

These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.(c)These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, these balances included $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.(d)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(e)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(f)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.132Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate(in millions, except ratios)Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 HELOCs:(a)     Within the revolving period(b)$5,455$6,363 0.26%0.50%Beyond the revolving period12,63113,532 2.723.56HELOANs1,1901,371 2.773.50Total$19,276$21,266 2.03%2.64%(a)These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.(in millions)Residential mortgage Home equity Total residential real estate – excluding PCIJun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017Impaired loans        With an allowance$3,816$4,407 $1,211$1,236 $5,027$5,643Without an allowance(a)1,2081,213 881882 2,0892,095Total impaired loans(b)(c)$5,024$5,620 $2,092$2,118 $7,116$7,738Allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans$94$62 $62$111 $156$173Unpaid principal balance of impaired loans(d)6,8707,741 3,6043,701 10,47411,442Impaired loans on nonaccrual status(e)1,7301,743 1,0411,032 2,7712,775(a)Represents collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2018, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 13% of residential mortgages and 9% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due.(b)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.(c)Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S.(d)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.(e)At both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans included $2.2 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.133The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Three months ended June 30,(in millions)Average impaired loans Interest income onimpaired loans(a) Interest income on impaired loans on a cash basis(a)20182017 20182017 20182017Residential mortgage$5,254$5,865 $66$68 $20$14Home equity2,0872,241 3330 2118Total residential real estate – excluding PCI$7,341$8,106 $99$98 $41$32         Six months ended June 30,(in millions)Average impaired loans Interest income onimpaired loans(a) Interest income on impaired loans on a cash basis(a)20182017 20182017 20182017Residential mortgage$5,431$5,921 $136$141 $39$33Home equity2,1052,245 6561 4238Total residential real estate – excluding PCI$7,536$8,166 $201$202 $81$71(a)Generally, interest income on loans modified in TDRs is recognized on a cash basis until the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms, unless the loan is deemed to be collateral-dependent.Loan modificationsModifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.At June 30, 2018, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for residential mortgage and 8 years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).  Active and suspended foreclosureAt June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $763 million and $787 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.136Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto and business banking loans.(in millions, except ratios)Auto Consumer & Business Banking Total other consumerJun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017Loan delinquency        Current$64,516$65,651 $25,964$25,454 $90,480$91,10530–119 days past due487584 197213 684797120 or more days past due117 111122 122129Total retained loans$65,014$66,242 $26,272$25,789 $91,286$92,031% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans0.77%0.89% 1.17%1.30% 0.88%1.01%Nonaccrual loans(a)124141 273283 397424Geographic region        California$8,512$8,445 $5,299$5,032 $13,811$13,477Texas6,6757,013 3,0142,916 9,6899,929New York3,9014,023 4,2224,195 8,1238,218Illinois3,7933,916 2,0662,017 5,8595,933Florida3,3893,350 1,4281,424 4,8174,774Arizona2,1032,221 1,4221,383 3,5253,604Ohio2,0442,105 1,3561,380 3,4003,485Michigan1,4171,418 1,3041,357 2,7212,775New Jersey1,9782,044 738721 2,7162,765Louisiana1,6021,656 885849 2,4872,505All other29,60030,051 4,5384,515 34,13834,566Total retained loans$65,014$66,242 $26,272$25,789 $91,286$92,031Loans by risk ratings(b)        Noncriticized$15,150$15,604 $18,387$17,938 $33,537$33,542Criticized performing26193 759791 1,020884Criticized nonaccrual79 204213 211222(a)There were no loans that were 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.(b)For risk-rated business banking and auto loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the risk rating of the loan, including whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual.137Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about the Firm’s other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.(in millions)June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Impaired loans   With an allowance$245 $272Without an allowance(a)26 26Total impaired loans(b)(c)$271 $298Allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans$70 $73Unpaid principal balance of impaired loans(d)373 402Impaired loans on nonaccrual status246 268(a)When discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.(b)Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S.(c)Other consumer average impaired loans were $277 million and $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $287 million and $501 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.(d)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $91 million and $102 million, respectively.

Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(c)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.139Approximately 25% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs.

The remaining $32 million and $37 million at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program.

Most of these loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications under long-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were $202 million and $176 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $425 million and $361 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 32.10% and 31.54% as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.141Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.

Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $20.5 billion and $20.4 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $9.7 billion and $8.8 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20.Municipal bond vehiclesMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as Customer TOB trusts and Non-Customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party; refer to page 148 of this Note for further information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all Non-Customer TOB transactions. For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s Municipal bond vehicles, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm had no exposure to nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored municipal bond vehicles at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Refer to page 148 of this Note for further information on consolidated municipal bond vehicles. 147Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.(d)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. For conduits program-wide credit enhancements, refer to note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $17.0 billion and $21.8 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. (e)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind, solar and other alternative energy projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the  general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $13.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, of which $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion was unfunded, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until qualification of the project for tax credits. For further information on affordable housing tax credits, refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20 of this Form 10-Q. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)The Firm may provide various services to Customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the 148Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to Customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2018 and December 31,  2017 was $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was $8.6 billion and $9.2 million, respectively. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. For a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these  transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 20 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.149 Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,(in millions)20182017 20182017Carrying value of loans sold$8,076$11,711 $16,836$28,880Proceeds received from loan sales as cash—4 —13Proceeds from loan sales as securities(a)7,95911,602 16,57828,589Total proceeds received from loan sales(b)$7,959$11,606 $16,578$28,602Gains on loan sales(c)(d)$9$42 $23$73(a)Predominantly includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt.(b)Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans.(c)Gains on loan sales include the value of MSRs.(d)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 20, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan  pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 11.The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Goodwill Impairment testingFor a further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, refer to Impairment testing on pages 244–245 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2018, or December 31, 2017, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2018 or 2017.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.151Mortgage servicing rightsMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

(b)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.(c)Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.(d)Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.152The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.153Note 15 – DepositsFor further information on deposits, refer to Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.(in millions)June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017U.S. offices   Noninterest-bearing$385,741 $393,645Interest-bearing (included $15,542 and $14,947 at fair value)(a)819,454 793,618Total deposits in U.S. offices1,205,195 1,187,263Non-U.S. offices   Noninterest-bearing16,602 15,576Interest-bearing (included $4,154 and $6,374 at fair value)(a)230,325 241,143Total deposits in non-U.S. offices246,927 256,719Total deposits$1,452,122 $1,443,982(a)Includes structured notes classified as deposits for which the fair value option has been elected.

Note 19 – Regulatory capitalFor a detailed discussion on regulatory capital, refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s insured depository institutions (“IDI”), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A.Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table represents the minimum and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2018.

(a)Represents the Transitional minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018, the CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 2.5% capital conservation buffer and 2.625%, resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 3.5% GSIB surcharge.  (b)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.  (e)For the period ended December 31, 2017, the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 7.5%, 9.0%, 11.0% and 4.0%, and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries were 5.75%, 7.25%, 9.25% and 4.0%, respectively.157The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and its significant IDI subsidiaries under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, JPMorgan Chase and all of its IDI subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.159Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitmentsContractual amountCarrying value(g)June 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017Jun 30, 2018Dec 31, 2017By remaining maturity (in millions)Expires in 1 year or lessExpires after 1 year through 3 yearsExpires after 3 years through 5 yearsExpires after 5 yearsTotalTotalLending-related          Consumer, excluding credit card:          Home equity$1,202$1,163$1,559$16,606$20,530$20,360$12$12Residential mortgage(a)8,342——128,3545,736——Auto7,7709491871539,0599,25522Consumer & Business Banking12,41079611052513,84113,2021919Total consumer, excluding credit card29,7242,9081,85617,29651,78448,5533333Credit card592,452———592,452572,831——Total consumer(b)622,1762,9081,85617,296644,236621,3843333Wholesale:          Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(c)86,217130,739140,3279,395366,678331,160942840Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(c)14,4698,7447,0421,70831,96335,226593636Other letters of credit(c)2,914541483,1163,71243Total wholesale(d)103,600139,537147,51711,103401,757370,0981,5391,479Total lending-related$725,776$142,445$149,373$28,399$1,045,993$991,482$1,572$1,512Other guarantees and commitmentsSecurities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(e)$202,797$—$—$—$202,797$179,490$—$—Derivatives qualifying as guarantees4,73733412,41540,23557,72157,174457304Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements102,480———102,48076,859——Unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements92,150———92,15044,205——Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:Mortgage repurchase liabilityNANANANANANA123111Loans sold with recourseNANANANA1,0841,1693338Other guarantees and commitments(f)11,7541,4582092,66416,08511,867(225)(76)(a)Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.(d)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the U.S. portion of the contractual amount of total wholesale lending-related commitments was 78% and 77%, respectively.(e)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $213.7 billion and $188.7 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash and securities issued by governments that are members of G7 and U.S. government agencies.(f)At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, primarily includes letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis, unfunded commitments related to institutional lending and commitments associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses. Additionally, includes unfunded commitments predominantly related to certain tax-oriented equity investments.(g)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value.160Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank, the Firm in part is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured  clearance advance facilities that the Firm extended to its clients (i.e., cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the Firm’s intra-day credit risk to the facility amount and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of December 31, 2017 the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2018 the Firm no longer offers such arrangements to its clients.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.The following table summarizes the standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Other letters of credit Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Other letters of creditInvestment-grade(a)$25,512 $2,267 $28,492 $2,646Noninvestment-grade(a)6,451 849 6,734 1,066Total contractual amount$31,963 $3,116 $35,226 $3,712        Allowance for lending-related commitments$139 $4 $192 $3Guarantee liability454 — 444 —Total carrying value$593 $4 $636 $3        Commitments with collateral$16,326 $597 $17,421 $878(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.

For a further discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 4.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs and in certain private label transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. For additional information, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.161The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Guarantees of subsidiaryThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company, and these guarantees rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.  Note 21 – Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Pledged assets The Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, and cover customer short sales. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.

For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt, refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Collateral is generally used under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover customer short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.7 billion at June 30, 2018. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:•the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, •the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, •the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and •the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.American Depositary Receipts Pre-Release Inquiry. The Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division has been investigating depositary banks and broker-dealers, including the Firm, in connection with activity relating to pre-released American Depositary Receipts. The Staff’s investigation focuses on the period of 2011 to 2015. The Firm has been cooperating with this investigation.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX-related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter.The Firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.-based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the “U.S. class action”). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the “exchanged-based actions”), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”), participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the “ERISA actions”), and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions. The Court granted final approval of that settlement agreement in May 2018. Certain members of the settlement class have filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class. 163The District Court has dismissed one of the ERISA actions, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that dismissal in July 2018. The District Court has also dismissed the indirect purchaser action, and the plaintiffs have sought leave to replead their complaint. The consumer action and a second ERISA action remain pending in the District Court.General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated Term Loan facility (“Term Loan”) for General Motors Corporation (“GM”). In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (“Creditors Committee”) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal of the Creditors Committee’s claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In connection with that additional collateral, a trial in the Bankruptcy Court regarding the value of certain representative assets concluded in May 2017, and a ruling was issued in September 2017. The Bankruptcy Court found that 33 of the 40 representative assets are fixtures and that these fixtures generally should be valued on a “going concern” basis. The Creditors Committee is seeking leave to appeal the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling that the fixtures should be valued on a “going concern” basis rather than on a liquidation basis. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. seeking indemnification and asserting various claims. The parties have engaged in mediation concerning, among other things, the characterization and value of the remaining additional collateral, in light of the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling regarding the representative assets, as well as other issues, including the cross-claims. In July 2018, the parties informed the Bankruptcy Court that, at this time, they do not believe that they will be able to reach a global settlement of the adversary proceeding through mediation, and that they intend to present the Bankruptcy Court with a proposed schedule for ongoing litigation. The parties will continue to mediate specific disputes involving certain issues, principally relating to whether certain of the additional collateral should be characterized as fixtures. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws. The parties settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement.A number of merchants appealed the settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. In March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined petitions seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. The parties to the class action seeking monetary relief have reached a settlement agreement in principle, subject to documentation and court approval, and are engaged in ongoing negotiations.In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates was submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) during similar time periods, as well as processes for the setting of U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods, including through 2012. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations to the extent that they are ongoing. The Firm has recently reached a resolution with the CFTC concerning the CFTC’s U.S. dollar ISDAFIX-related investigation. As previously reported, the Firm has resolved EC inquiries relating to Yen LIBOR and Swiss Franc 164LIBOR. In December 2016, the Firm resolved ComCo inquiries relating to these same rates. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various United States District Courts. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation.The Firm has agreed to settle putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts, Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate. Those settlements are all subject to further documentation and court approval.In an action related to EURIBOR, the District Court dismissed all claims except a single antitrust claim and two common law claims, and dismissed all defendants except the Firm and Citibank.In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted antitrust claims, claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims to proceed. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. In February 2018, the District Court (i) granted class certification with respect to certain antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, (ii) denied class certification with respect to state common law claims brought by the holders of those bonds and swaps and (iii) denied class certification with respect to two other putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts and LIBOR-based loans held by plaintiff lending institutions. The Firm and another defendant have petitioned for leave to appeal the class certification of the antitrust claims related to bonds and swaps, and plaintiffs have petitioned for leave to appeal the denial of class certification as to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts. In July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied  the plaintiff lending institutions’ petition for leave to appeal the denial of their motion for class certification.In an action related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, the District Court dismissed without prejudice all claims except a single antitrust claim, and dismissed without prejudice all defendants except the Firm, Bank of America and Citibank. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2017, which the Firm and other defendants have moved to dismiss.The Firm is one of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. In April 2016, the Firm settled this litigation, along with certain other banks. Those settlements have been preliminarily approved by the Court.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3.0 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), were named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates were brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally sought to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered 165into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. In January 2017, the Court substantially denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss an amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. In October 2017, JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates reached an agreement to settle the litigation brought by the Petters bankruptcy trustees, or their successors, and the receiver for Thomas J. Petters. The settlement has received Court approval.Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. The Firm has been successful in legal challenges made to the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, with respect to the criminal proceedings. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firm is requesting clarification from the Court of Cassation concerning the Court of Appeal’s decision before seeking direction on next steps in the criminal proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.* * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense for litigation and investigations was $0 million and $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.166Note 23 – Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, refer to Segment results below, and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Segment resultsThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the  reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.Business segment capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on pages 88-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1.Net income in 2018 for the business segments reflects the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA.Segment results and reconciliation(a)As of or for the three months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios)Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset & Wealth Management20182017 20182017 20182017 20182017Noninterest revenue$3,748$3,684 $7,532$6,480 $633$583 $2,687$2,591Net interest income8,7497,728 2,3912,445 1,6831,505 885846Total net revenue12,49711,412 9,9238,925 2,3162,088 3,5723,437Provision for credit losses1,1081,394 58(53) 43(130) 24Noninterest expense6,8796,500 5,4034,877 844790 2,5662,417Income before income tax expense4,5103,518 4,4624,101 1,4291,428 1,0041,016Income tax expense1,0981,295 1,2641,391 342526 249392Net income$3,412$2,223 $3,198$2,710 $1,087$902 $755$624Average equity$51,000$51,000 $70,000$70,000 $20,000$20,000 $9,000$9,000Total assets552,674529,859 908,954847,377 220,232220,676 161,474147,508Return on equity26%17% 17%15% 21%17% 33%27%Overhead ratio5557 5455 3638 7270As of or for the three months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios)Corporate Reconciling Items(a) Total20182017 20182017 20182017Noninterest revenue$142$781 $(474)$(596) $14,268$13,523Net interest income(62)23 (161)$(339) 13,48512,208Total net revenue80804 (635)$(935) 27,75325,731Provision for credit losses(1)— —— 1,2101,215Noninterest expense279183 —— 15,97114,767Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)(198)621 (635)(935) 10,5729,749Income tax expense/(benefit)(62)51 (635)(935) 2,2562,720Net income/(loss)$(136)$570 $—$— $8,316$7,029Average equity$78,901$80,200 $—$— $228,901$230,200Total assets746,716817,754 NANA 2,590,0502,563,174Return on equityNMNM NMNM 14%12%Overhead ratioNMNM NMNM 5857(a)Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 27, 2018, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.  Basis for Review ResultsThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.August 1, 2018PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017169JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates(Taxable-equivalent interest and rates; in millions, except rates)     Three months ended June 30, 2018 Three months ended June 30, 2017 AveragebalanceInterest(f) Rate(annualized) AveragebalanceInterest(f) Rate(annualized)Assets           Deposits with banks$425,942$1,543 1.45%  $439,142$1,018 0.93 % Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements205,001807 1.58  193,302528 1.10 Securities borrowed112,464148 0.53  90,151(21)(h) (0.09) Trading assets – debt instruments256,5262,127 3.33  234,8091,834 3.13 Taxable securities189,4191,383 2.93  229,1961,410 2.47 Nontaxable securities(a)42,588494 4.65  45,499720 6.35 Total investment securities232,0071,877 3.24(g)  274,6952,130 3.11(g) Loans939,67511,680 4.99  904,96910,065 4.46 All other interest-earning assets(b)50,662848 6.72  40,041435 4.35 Total interest-earning assets2,222,27719,030 3.43  2,177,10915,989 2.95 Allowance for loan losses(13,223)     (13,350)    Cash and due from banks22,050     19,797    Trading assets – equity instruments112,142     126,127    Trading assets – derivative receivables60,978     58,250    Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets54,616     53,902    Other assets154,129     137,401    Total assets$2,612,969     $2,559,236    Liabilities           Interest-bearing deposits$1,059,357$1,340 0.51%  $1,006,008$629 0.25 % Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements192,136759 1.58  196,331387 0.79 Short-term borrowings(c)62,339260 1.67  43,15996 0.89 Trading liabilities – debt and other interest-bearing liabilities(d)(e)180,879901 2.00  173,373515 1.19 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs20,906121 2.33  34,083128 1.51 Long-term debt275,6452,003 2.91  295,8681,687 2.29 Total interest-bearing liabilities1,791,2625,384 1.21  1,748,8223,442 0.79 Noninterest-bearing deposits401,138     404,121    Trading liabilities – equity instruments(e)34,593     19,346    Trading liabilities – derivative payables42,168     44,740    All other liabilities, including the allowance for lending-related commitments88,839     85,939    Total liabilities2,358,000     2,302,968    Stockholders’ equity           Preferred stock26,068     26,068    Common stockholders’ equity228,901     230,200    Total stockholders’ equity254,969     256,268    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$2,612,969     $2,559,236    Interest rate spread   2.22%     2.16 % Net interest income and net yield on interest-earning assets $13,646 2.46   $12,547 2.31 Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards.

A CCP becomes counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement.CDS: Credit default swapsCEO: Chief Executive OfficerCET1 Capital: Common equity Tier 1 CapitalCFTC: Commodity Futures Trading CommissionCFO: Chief Financial OfficerChase Bank USA, N.A.: Chase Bank USA, National AssociationCIB: Corporate & Investment BankCIO: Chief Investment OfficeClient deposits and other third party liabilities: Deposits, as well as deposits that are swept to on-balance sheet liabilities (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements) as part of client cash management programs. CLO: Collateralized loan obligationsCLTV: Combined loan-to-value  Collateral-dependent: A loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower’s operations, income or other resources. Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions.Core loans: represents loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit.Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.Criticized: Criticized loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables that are classified as special mention, substandard and doubtful categories for regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.CRO: Chief Risk OfficerCVA: Credit valuation adjustments DFAST: Dodd-Frank Act Stress TestDodd-Frank Act: Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection ActDOJ: U.S. Department of JusticeDOL: U.S. Department of LaborDVA: Debit valuation adjustment EC: European Commission Eligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteriaEmbedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 172to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.ERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974EPS: Earnings per shareExchange-traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.Fannie Mae: Federal National Mortgage AssociationFASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board FCA: Financial Conduct AuthorityFCC: Firmwide Control CommitteeFDIA: Federal Depository Insurance ActFDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationFederal Reserve: The Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemFee share: Proportion of fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysisMoody’s: Moody’s Investor ServicesMortgage product types:Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.MSA: Metropolitan statistical areasMSR: Mortgage servicing rightsNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net interchange income includes the following components:•Interchange income: A fee paid to a credit card issuer in the clearing and settlement of a sales or cash advance transaction.•Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs.•Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.174Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningfulNOL: Net operating lossNonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss)OEP: One Equity PartnersOIS: Overnight index swapOPEB: Other postretirement employee benefitOTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairmentOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.PCA: Prompt corrective action PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of  the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.PD: Probability of defaultPRA: Prudential Regulatory AuthorityPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. PSU(s): Performance share units Receivables from customers: primarily represents margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules.REO: Real estate ownedReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Revenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan 175syndications.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.S&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 IndexSAR(s): Stock appreciation rightsSCCL: Single-counterparty credit limitsScored portfolio: The scored portfolio predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans and certain auto and business banking loans where credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time.

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.179Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 121-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.Item 4. Controls and Procedures.As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls do occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 146 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.Part II – Other InformationItem 1.
