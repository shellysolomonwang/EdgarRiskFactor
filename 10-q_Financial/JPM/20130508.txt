Item 1A: Risk Factors, on page 190 of this Form 10-Q; and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 8–21 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“2012 Annual Report” or “2012 Form 10-K”), to which reference is hereby made.JPMorgan Chase & Co., a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. The Firm had $2.4 trillion in assets and $207.1 billion in stockholders’ equity as of March 31, 2013. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients.JPMorgan Chase’s principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national bank with U.S. branches in 23 states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (“Chase Bank USA, N.A.”), a national bank that is the Firm’s credit card–issuing bank. JPMorgan Chase’s principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“JPMorgan Securities”), the Firm’s U.S. investment banking firm. The bank and nonbank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. One of the Firm’s principal operating subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) is J.P. Morgan Securities plc (formerly J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase’s activities are organized, for management reporting purposes, into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The Firm’s consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking segment. The Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset Management segments comprise the Firm’s wholesale businesses. A description of the Firm’s business segments, and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases, follows.Consumer & Community BankingConsumer & Community Banking (“CCB”) serves consumers and businesses through personal service at bank branches and through ATMs, online, mobile and telephone banking. CCB is organized into Consumer & Business Banking, Mortgage Banking (including Mortgage Production, Mortgage Servicing and Real Estate Portfolios) and Card, Merchant Services & Auto (“Card”). Consumer & Business Banking offers deposit and investment products and services to consumers, and lending, deposit, and cash management and payment solutions to small businesses. Mortgage Banking includes mortgage origination and servicing activities, as well as portfolios comprised of residential mortgages and home equity loans, including the purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) portfolio acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.

For a complete description of trends and uncertainties, as well as the risks and critical accounting estimates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business, this Form 10-Q should be read in its entirety.Economic environmentDuring the first quarter of 2013, the U.S. economy continued to grow at a modest pace. The U.S. unemployment rate declined to 7.6% as U.S. labor market conditions continued to improve, although hiring may have slowed in March. After turning the corner in 2012, the U.S. housing market continued to improve during the first quarter, with rising prices, existing home sales hitting their highest level in three years and homebuilding permits rising at the fastest pace since mid-2008.The economies of many of the European Union member countries continued to struggle during the first quarter of 2013. In the first quarter, the Eurozone was tested again by the banking crisis in Cyprus. By the end of the first quarter, that nation had turned to the Eurozone and the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) to recapitalize its banking system.Asia’s developing economies continued to expand at a modest pace in the first quarter, keeping global inflationary pressures in check. In Latin America, attention continued to be focused on Argentina where the local currency has declined toward historic lows as the economic situation in that country has worsened. Both Argentina and Brazil were dealing with inflation issues.U.S. inflation estimates remained below the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s (the “Federal Reserve”) 2% long-run goal. The Federal Reserve maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to one quarter percent and tied its interest rate forecasts to the evolution of the economy, in particular, inflation and unemployment rates.At the beginning of the quarter, financial markets reacted favorably when the U.S. Congress reached an agreement to resolve the so-called “fiscal cliff” by passing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This Act made permanent most of the tax cuts initiated in 2001 and 2003 and allowed the tax rate on the top income bracket, which was increased to $450,000 annually for joint tax filers, to revert to 39.6% from 35.0%.For the remainder of 2013, the U.S. economy is likely to be affected by the continuing uncertainty about Europe’s financial crisis, geopolitical developments, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and the ongoing fiscal debate over the U.S. debt limit, government spending and taxes. Spending and debt ceiling issues are likely to return to the spotlight during the second quarter when the U.S. is projected to reach its debt limit again. Financial performance of JPMorgan Chase   Three months ended March 31,(in millions, except per share data and ratios)2013 2012 ChangeSelected income statement data     Total net revenue$25,122 $26,052 (4)%Total noninterest expense15,423 18,345 (16)Pre-provision profit9,699 7,707 26Provision for credit losses617 726 (15)Net income6,529 4,924 33Diluted earnings per share1.59 1.19 34Return on common equity13% 11%  Capital ratios     Tier 1 capital(a)11.6 11.9  Tier 1 common(a)10.2 9.8  (a)In the first quarter of 2013, regulatory rules requiring additional capital for certain trading positions and securitizations became effective (“Basel 2.5”). This resulted in an increase to risk-weighted assets of approximately $150 billion, resulting in a decrease to the Firm’s Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common capital ratios by 140 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. For further discussion of Basel 2.5, see Regulatory capital on pages 42–45 of this Form 10-Q.Business OverviewJPMorgan Chase reported record first-quarter 2013 net income of $6.5 billion, or a record $1.59 per share, on net revenue of $25.1 billion. Net income increased by $1.6 billion, or 33%, compared with net income of $4.9 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the first quarter of 2012. ROE for the quarter was 13%, compared with 11% for the prior-year quarter. Results in the first quarter of 2013 included the following significant items: $650 million pretax benefit ($0.10 per share after-tax increase in earnings) from a reduction in the allowance for loan losses in Real Estate Portfolios; and $500 million pretax benefit ($0.08 per share after-tax increase in earnings) from a reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio. The tax rate used for each of the above significant items is 38%; for additional information, see the discussion at the end of this section on page 8.The increase in net income from the first quarter of 2012 was driven by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. The decrease in net revenue compared with the prior year was due to a $1.1 billion benefit from the WaMu bankruptcy settlement in the prior year, lower mortgage fees and related income and lower lending- and deposit-related fees, largely offset by higher principal transactions revenue. The increase in principal transactions revenue reflected: the absence of $1.4 billion of losses on CIO’s synthetic credit portfolio, which was recorded in the first quarter of the prior year; and, this year, a DVA gain on structured notes and derivative liabilities of $126 million resulting from the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads, 6compared with a DVA loss of $907 million in the prior year. Net interest income decreased compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as well as lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and loan portfolio run-off, lower investment securities yield, and limited reinvestment opportunities, partially offset by lower long-term debt costs, primarily due to a change in funding mix, and lower deposit costs.Results in the first quarter of 2013 reflected positive credit trends for the residential real estate and credit card portfolios. The provision for credit losses was $617 million, down $109 million, or 15%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $545 million, down $92 million from the prior year. The current-quarter consumer provision included a $1.2 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, and also the impact of improved home prices in the residential real estate portfolio. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.7 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.92% and 2.60%, respectively, excluding in each year the purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) portfolio. The decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency trends. A favorable credit environment and stable credit trends also prevailed across the Firm’s wholesale loan portfolios as the Firm continued to experience low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $72 million, compared with $89 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $35 million, compared with $5 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.27%, compared with 3.11% in the prior year, excluding in each year the PCI portfolio. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $11.6 billion at March 31, 2013, down from $11.7 billion in the prior quarter and down from $12.0 billion in the prior year.Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $2.9 billion, or 16%, compared with the prior year. The prior year included pretax expense of $2.7 billion for additional litigation reserves.The Firm’s results reflected strong performance in all of its businesses. Consumer & Community Banking average deposits were up 10%. Mortgage Banking originations were $52.7 billion, up 37% compared with the prior year. Credit Card sales volume, excluding Commercial Card, was up 9% compared with the prior year. The Corporate & Investment Bank reported strong performance across products and maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees. The Corporate & Investment Bank’s assets under custody rose to $19.3 trillion, up 8% compared with the prior year. Asset Management reported positive net long-term product flows for the sixteenth consecutive quarter to a record of $31.0 billion for the first quarter and reported  record loan balances of $81.4 billion and record assets under supervision of $2.2 trillion.The Firm strengthened its balance sheet, ending the first quarter with Basel I Tier 1 common capital of $143 billion and a Tier 1 common ratio of 10.2%, including the impact of Basel 2.5 rules that became effective at the beginning of this year. The Firm estimated that its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 8.9% at March 31, 2013, including the impact of the Basel 2.5 rules and the requirements included in the Federal Reserve’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued in June 2012 (“NPR”). (The Basel I and III Tier 1 common ratios are non- GAAP financial measures, which the Firm uses along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Tier 1 common capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 42–45 of this Form 10-Q.)JPMorgan Chase continued to support clients, consumers, companies, and communities around the globe. The Firm provided credit and raised capital of $480 billion for commercial and consumer clients during the first three months of 2013. This included nearly $4 billion of credit provided for U.S. small businesses and $123 billion of credit provided for corporations. This also included more than $255 billion of capital for clients and more than $17 billion of credit provided to, and capital raised for, nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities.Consumer & Community Banking net income decreased compared to the prior year, reflecting lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue decreased, driven by lower noninterest revenue and net interest income. Noninterest revenue decreased, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income. Net interest income decreased, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by higher deposit balances. The provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2013 was $549 million compared with $642 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios. The provision for the first quarter of 2012 reflected a $1.8 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Noninterest expense decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the prior year. The prior year included approximately $200 million for foreclosure-related matters, including adjustments for the global settlement with federal and state agencies. Return on equity for the first quarter of 2013 was 23% on $46.0 billion of average allocated capital.Corporate & Investment Bank net income increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net revenue for the first quarter of 2013 included a $126 million gain from debit 7valuation adjustments (“DVA”) on structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads; the prior-year included a $907 million loss from DVA. The increase in net revenue also reflected higher Banking revenue. Noninterest expense was down slightly from the prior year, driven by lower compensation expense and lower noncompensation expense related to efficiency initiatives, largely offset by higher litigation expense. Return on equity for the first quarter of 2013 was 19%, or 18% excluding DVA (a non-GAAP financial measure), on $56.5 billion of average allocated capital.Commercial Banking net income increased slightly compared with the prior year, reflecting lower provision for credit losses and an increase in net revenue, predominantly offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was slightly higher compared with the prior year, driven by growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments, lower community development investment-related revenue, and spread compression on loan products. Noninterest expense increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher headcount-related expense and increased operating expense for Commercial Card. Return on equity for the first quarter of 2013 was 18% on $13.5 billion of average allocated capital.Asset Management net income increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense. Noninterest revenue increased due to net client inflows, higher performance fees and the effect of higher market levels. Net interest income increased due to higher loan and deposit balances. Noninterest expense increased from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related expense and performance-based compensation. Return on equity for the first quarter of 2013 was 22% on $9.0 billion of average allocated capital.Corporate/Private Equity net income was $250 million, compared with a net loss of $1.0 billion in the prior year. Private Equity reported a net loss of $182 million, compared with net income of $134 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss compared with positive net revenue in the prior year, due to net valuation losses on private investments.Treasury and CIO reported net income of $24 million, compared with a net loss of $227 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $113 million, compared with a loss of $233 million in the prior year. Net revenue for the first quarter of 2012 included $1.4 billion of losses on CIO’s synthetic credit portfolio. Net interest income for the current quarter was a loss of $472 million due to low interest rates and limited reinvestment opportunities.Other Corporate reported net income of $408 million in the first quarter, compared with a net loss of $929 million in the prior year. The current quarter included a benefit for tax adjustments. The prior-year included a $1.1 billion benefit  from the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement offset by $2.5 billion of additional litigation reserves.Note: The Firm uses a single U.S.-based, blended marginal tax rate of 38% (“the marginal rate”) to report the estimated after-tax effects of each significant item affecting net income. This rate represents the weighted-average marginal tax rate for the U.S. consolidated tax group. The Firm uses this single marginal rate to reflect the tax effects of all significant items because (a) it simplifies the presentation and analysis for management and investors; (b) it has proved to be a reasonable estimate of the marginal tax effects; and (c) often there is uncertainty at the time a significant item is disclosed regarding its ultimate tax outcome.2013 Business outlookThe following forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firm’s actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 89 and Risk Factors on page 190 of this Form 10-Q.JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the remainder of 2013 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business.The Firm expects that net interest income for full-year 2013 will be approximately 1% lower than in 2012 as modest spread compression is expected to be offset by balance growth. In the Consumer & Business Banking business within CCB, the Firm estimates that net interest income could decline by approximately $200 million as continued deposit spread compression is expected to be largely offset by deposit balance growth. For Real Estate Portfolios within CCB, net interest income is expected to decline by approximately $400 million given management’s current estimate of net portfolio runoff levels. However, over time, the reduction in net interest income should be offset by an improvement in credit costs and lower expense. Net interest income for Treasury and CIO within Corporate/Private Equity is expected to decline as a result of limited reinvestment opportunities (this is reflected in the net income guidance for this business as described below), but this decline in net interest income is expected to be largely offset by growth in interest earning assets across the wholesale businesses. The Firm continues to focus on expense discipline and expects total noninterest expense for the full year 2013 to be approximately $1 billion lower than in 2012 (not taking 8into account any expense in each year related to Corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters).In Mortgage Banking within CCB, management expects to continue to incur elevated default- and foreclosure-related costs, including additional costs associated with the Firm’s mortgage servicing processes, particularly its loan modification and foreclosure procedures. The Firm expects there will be continued elevated levels of repurchases of mortgages previously sold, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”). However, based on current trends and estimates, management believes that the existing mortgage repurchase liability is sufficient to cover such losses.For Real Estate Portfolios within Mortgage Banking, management believes that total quarterly net charge-offs are likely to be at or below $400 million. If net charge-offs and delinquencies continue to trend down, the related allowance for loan losses could be reduced over time.In the Card Services business within Card, Merchant Services & Auto, the Firm expects that, in light of current credit trends in the credit card portfolio, the related allowance for loan losses could be reduced by approximately $1 billion for full-year 2013 (which includes the $500 million reduction in the first quarter of 2013).The currently anticipated results for CCB described above could be adversely affected if economic conditions, including U.S. housing prices or the unemployment rate, do not continue to improve. Management continues to closely monitor the portfolios in these businesses.In Private Equity, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, earnings will likely continue to be volatile and influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific issues.For Treasury and CIO, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, management currently believes that during 2013 it may generate a quarterly net loss of approximately $300 million, with that amount likely to vary each quarter driven by the implied yield curve and management decisions related to the positioning of the investment securities portfolio.For Other Corporate, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, management expects quarterly net income, excluding material litigation expense and significant items, if any, to be approximately $100 million, but this amount is also likely to vary each quarter.Regulatory developmentsJPMorgan Chase is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The Firm is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulation and supervision, and such changes could have a significant  impact on how the Firm conducts business. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies are instructed to conduct approximately 285 rulemakings and 130 studies and reports. These agencies include the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the “CFPB”). The Firm continues to work diligently in assessing and understanding the implications of the regulatory changes it is facing, and is devoting substantial resources to implementing all the new regulations while, at the same time, best meeting the needs and expectations of its clients.The Firm is experiencing heightened scrutiny by its regulators of its compliance with new and existing regulations, including those issued under the Bank Secrecy Act, the Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices laws, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), the Truth in Lending Act, laws governing the Firm’s consumer collections practices and the laws administered by the Office of Foreign Control, among others. The Firm is also under scrutiny by its supervisors with respect to its controls and operational processes, such as those relating to model development, review, governance and approvals. On January 14, 2013, the Firm and three of its subsidiary banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into Consent Orders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC relating principally to the Firm’s and such banks’ BSA/AML policies and procedures. Also on January 14, 2013, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into Consent Orders arising out of their reviews of the Firm’s Chief Investment Office. These latter Consent Orders relate to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm. The Firm expects that its banking supervisors will in the future continue to take more formal enforcement actions against the Firm, (including Consent Orders related to certain non-mortgage consumer collections practices and certain sales of an ancillary identity theft protection product) rather than issuing informal supervisory actions or criticisms.While the effect of the changes in law and the heightened scrutiny of its regulators is likely to result in additional costs, the Firm cannot, given the current status of regulatory and supervisory developments, quantify the possible effects on its business and operations of all the significant changes that are currently underway. For further discussion of regulatory developments, see Supervision and regulation on pages 1–8 and Risk factors on pages 8–21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Form 10-K.On January 7, 2013, the Firm submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2013 CCAR process. On March 14, 2013, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2013 9capital plan, but asked the Firm to submit an additional capital plan, as discussed further below. Following this notification, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors intends to increase the second-quarter common stock dividend to $0.38 per share from the current $0.30 per share, returning the dividend to its highest level. The Board of Directors has also authorized the Firm to repurchase up to $6 billion of common equity commencing with the second quarter of this year through the end of the first quarter of 2014. The Federal Reserve has asked the Firm to submit by the end of the third quarter of 2013 an additional capital plan addressing the weaknesses it identified in the Firm’s CCAR capital planning processes. The Firm intends to fully address the Federal Reserve’s requirements. Following its review, the Federal Reserve may require the Firm to modify its capital distributions. For more information, see Capital management on pages 42–47. Subsequent events Redemption of outstanding trust preferred securitiesOn May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0 billion of trust preferred securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions set forth in the documents governing those trust preferred securities. Issuance of preferred stockOn April 23, 2013, the Firm issued $1.5 billion of noncumulative preferred stock.10CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, see pages 85–87 of this Form 10-Q and pages 178–182 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Revenue      Three months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012 ChangeInvestment banking fees$1,445 $1,381 5 %Principal transactions3,761 2,722 38Lending- and deposit-related fees1,468 1,517 (3)Asset management, administration and commissions3,599 3,392 6Securities gains509 536 (5)Mortgage fees and related income1,452 2,010 (28)Card income1,419 1,316 8Other income(a)536 1,512 (65)Noninterest revenue14,189 14,386 (1)Net interest income10,933 11,666 (6)Total net revenue$25,122 $26,052 (4)%(a)Included operating lease income of $349 million and $323 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Total net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was $25.1 billion, a decrease of $930 million, or 4%, from the three months ended March 31, 2013. The decrease was due to lower net interest income, mortgage fees and related income, and other income. The decrease was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenue.Investment banking fees for the three months ended March 31, 2013, increased slightly from the prior year, due to higher debt underwriting fees, which included record bond underwriting fees on record levels of industry-wide high-yield bond issuance. The increase was partially offset by lower advisory fees. For additional information on investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in CIB, see CIB segment results pages 25–28 and Note 6 on page 120 of this Form 10-Q.Principal transactions revenue increased significantly in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared with the prior year. The increase reflected the absence of $1.4 billion of losses on CIO’s synthetic credit portfolio, which was recorded in the prior year; and a DVA gain on structured notes and derivative liabilities of $126 million, resulting from the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads, compared with a DVA loss of $907 million in the prior year. The three months ended March 31, 2013, also reflected solid client revenue in fixed income and equity markets. The increase was partially offset by net valuation losses on  private investments in Corporate/Private Equity during the three months ended March 31, 2013. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see CIB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on pages 25–28 and 33–34, respectively, and Note 6 on page 120 of this Form 10-Q.Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased modestly compared with the prior year. The decrease was largely due to lower deposit fees in CCB, resulting from reductions in certain product and transaction fees. For additional information on lending- and deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in CCB, CIB and CB, see the segment results for CCB on pages 16–24, CIB on pages 25–28 and CB on pages 29–30 of this Form 10-Q.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by higher investment management fees in AM due to net client inflows, higher performance fees and the effect of higher market levels. The increase was partially offset by lower brokerage commissions. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for CCB on pages 16–24, AM on pages 31–32, and Note 6 on page 120 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gains decreased slightly compared with the prior year, reflecting the absence of a gain recognized in 2012 on an investment security in CCB, offset partially by the results of repositioning the CIO available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio. For additional information on securities gains, which are predominantly recorded in the Firm’s Corporate/Private Equity segment, see the Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 33–34, and Note 11 on pages 123–126 of this Form 10-Q.Mortgage fees and related income decreased compared with the prior year. The decrease resulted from lower mortgage servicing revenue and mortgage production revenue. The decrease in mortgage servicing revenue was predominantly due to lower mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) risk management results due to prepayment model assumption updates, primarily driven by an improvement in housing price appreciation assumptions. The decrease in mortgage production revenue reflected lower margins due to tightening of primary/secondary spreads, as well as pricing pressure due to increased capacity in the market, partially offset by higher volumes. For additional information on mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded predominantly in CCB, see CCB’s Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing discussion on pages 19–21, and Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q.Card income increased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2012. The increase was driven by higher net interchange income on credit and debit cards, and higher merchant servicing revenue, both due to increases in business volume. For additional information on credit card 11income, see the CCB segment results on pages 16–24 of this Form 10-Q.Other income decreased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2012, driven by the absence of a $1.1 billion benefit from the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement in Corporate/Private Equity.Net interest income decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the prior year. The decline reflected the impact of low interest rates, as well as lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and loan portfolio run-off, lower investment securities yield, and limited reinvestment opportunities; these items were partially offset by lower long-term debt costs, primarily due to a change in funding mix, and lower deposit costs. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $1.9 trillion for the three months ended March 31, 2013, and the net interest yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.37%, a decrease of 24 basis points from the prior year.Provision for credit losses     Three months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012 ChangeConsumer, excluding credit card$(37) $1 NMCredit card582 636 (8)%Total consumer545 637 (14)Wholesale72 89 (19)Total provision for credit losses$617 $726 (15)%The provision for credit losses decreased by $109 million compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by a lower provision for total consumer credit losses, due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by a lower benefit from the reduction in the allowance for loan losses ($1.2 billion in 2013 compared with $1.8 billion in 2012). The level of the wholesale provision in 2013 reflected a favorable credit environment and stable credit trends. For a more detailed discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see the segment discussions for CCB on pages 16–24, CIB on pages 25–28 and CB on pages 29–30, and the Allowance For Credit Losses section on pages 74–76 of this Form 10-Q.Noninterest expense     Three months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012 ChangeCompensation expense$8,414 $8,613 (2)%Noncompensation expense:     Occupancy901 961 (6)Technology, communications and equipment1,332 1,271 5Professional and outside services1,734 1,795 (3)Marketing589 680 (13)Other(a)(b)2,301 4,832 (52)Amortization of intangibles152 193 (21)Total noncompensation expense7,009 9,732 (28)Total noninterest expense$15,423 $18,345 (16)% (a)Included litigation expense of $347 million and $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(b)Included FDIC-related expense of $379 million and $401 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Total noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was $15.4 billion, down by $2.9 billion, or 16%, compared with the prior year. The decrease was due to significantly lower other expense, in particular, litigation expense in Corporate/Private Equity.Compensation expense decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2012, predominantly due to lower expense in CIB; the decrease was partially offset by the impact of investments in the businesses, including front office sales and support staff in AM and CB.Noncompensation expense decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2013, due to significantly lower other expense, in particular, litigation expense in Corporate/Private Equity and CCB, offset partially by an increase in litigation expense in CIB. Litigation expense in 2012 included $2.5 billion predominantly for mortgage-related matters in Corporate/Private Equity, and approximately $200 million for foreclosure-related matters in CCB. Other factors contributing to the decrease in noncompensation expense were the following: in CCB, the absence of an expense that was recorded in 2012, related to a non-core product, lower marketing expense, lower servicing and foreclosure-related expense; and the impact of efficiency initiatives across the Firm. The decrease in noncompensation expense was offset partially by the impact of investments in the businesses, including branch builds in CCB. For a further discussion of litigation expense, see Note 23 on pages 170–179 of this Form 10-Q. For a discussion of amortization of intangibles, refer to Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q.Income tax expense  (in millions, except rate)Three months ended March 31,2013 2012Income before income tax expense$9,082 $6,981Income tax expense2,553 2,057Effective tax rate28.1% 29.5%The decrease in the effective tax rate compared with 2012 was largely attributable to tax benefits associated with prior year tax adjustments and the settlement of tax audits. This was partially offset by the impact of higher reported pretax income in combination with changes in the mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes. The prior year included deferred tax benefits associated with state and local income taxes. For additional information on income taxes, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 85–87 of this Form 10-Q.12EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe Firm prepares its consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”); these financial statements appear on pages 90–94 of this Form 10-Q. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable  investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the business-segment level, because it believes these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the business segment with the performance of its competitors. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVS represents the Firm’s tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares. Tier 1 common under Basel I and III rules are used by management, along with other capital  measures, to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. For additional information on Tier 1 common under Basel I and III, see Regulatory capital on pages 42–45 of this Form10-Q. All of the aforementioned measures are useful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors.13Average tangible common equity  Three months ended March 31,(in millions, except per share and ratio data) 2013 2012Common stockholders’ equity $194,733 $177,711Less: Goodwill 48,168 48,218Less: Certain identifiable intangible assets 2,162 3,137Add: Deferred tax liabilities(a) 2,828 2,724Tangible common equity $147,231 $129,080     Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) 17% 15%Tangible book value per share $39.54 $34.79(a)Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE.Core net interest incomeIn addition to reviewing JPMorgan Chase’s net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews core net interest income to assess the performance of its core lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities (which excludes the impact of CIB’s market-based activities). The core data presented below are non-GAAP financial measures due to the  exclusion of CIB’s market-based net interest income and the related assets. Management believes this exclusion provides investors and analysts a more meaningful measure by which to analyze the non-market-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on core lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.Core net interest income data(a) Three months ended March 31,(in millions, except rates)20132012 ChangeNet interest income – managed basis(b)(c)$11,095$11,837 (6)%Less: Market-based net interest income1,4321,569 (9)Core net interest income(b)$9,663$10,268 (6)     Average interest-earning assets$1,896,084$1,821,513 4Less: Average market-based earning assets508,941490,750 4Core average interest-earning assets$1,387,143$1,330,763 4 %Net interest yield on interest-earning assets – managed basis2.37%2.61%  Net interest yield on market-based activity1.141.29  Core net interest yield on core average interest-earning assets2.83%3.10%  (a)Includes core lending, investing and deposit-raising activities on a managed basis across CCB, CIB, CB, AM, Corporate/Private Equity; excludes the market-based activities within the CIB.(b)Interest includes the effect of related hedging derivatives.

The decline in net interest income reflected the impact of low interest rates, as well as lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and portfolio run-off, and lower investment securities yield. The decline was partially offset by lower long-term debt costs, primarily due to a change in funding mix, and lower deposit costs. The increase in average interest-earning assets was driven by higher deposits with banks and loan growth. The core net interest yield decreased by 27 basis points to 2.83% in the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and run-off, lower investment securities yield, limited reinvestment opportunities, and was partially offset by lower long-term debt costs, primarily  due to a change in funding mix and lower customer deposit rates.Other financial measuresThe Firm also discloses the allowance for loan losses to total retained loans, excluding residential real estate purchased credit-impaired loans. For a further discussion of this credit metric, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 74–76 of this Form 10-Q.14BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTSThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. The business segment financial results presented reflect the current organization of JPMorgan Chase. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, on pages 13–14 of this Form 10-Q.Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results allocates income and expense using market-based methodologies. For a further discussion of those methodologies, see Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 78–79 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. The Firm continues to assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Business segment capital allocation changesEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III) and economic risk measures. The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Effective January 1, 2013, the Firm further refined the capital allocation framework to align it with the revised line of business structure that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses is largely driven by the most current regulatory guidance on Basel III requirements (including the NPR), principally for CIB and CIO, and by anticipated business growth. For further information about these capital changes, see Line of business equity on page 46 of this Form 10-Q.Segment Results – Managed BasisThe following table summarizes the business segment results for the periods indicated.Three months ended March 31,Total net revenue Noninterest expense Pre-provision profit/(loss)(in millions)20132012Change 20132012Change 20132012ChangeConsumer & Community Banking$11,615$12,363(6)% $6,790$7,038(4)% $4,825$5,325(9)%Corporate & Investment Bank10,1409,3389 6,1116,211(2) 4,0293,12729Commercial Banking1,6731,6571 6445988 1,0291,059(3)Asset Management2,6532,37012 1,8761,7299 77764121Corporate/Private Equity(233)1,029NM 22,769(100) (235)(1,740)86Total$25,848$26,757(3)% $15,423$18,345(16)% $10,425$8,41224 %Three months ended March 31,Provision for credit losses Net income/(loss) Return on common equity(in millions, except ratios)20132012Change 20132012Change 20132012Consumer & Community Banking$549$642(14)% $2,586$2,936(12)% 23%27%Corporate & Investment Bank11(3)NM 2,6102,03328 1917Commercial Banking3977(49) 5965911 1825Asset Management211911 48738626 2222Corporate/Private Equity (3)(9)67 250(1,022)NM NMNMTotal$617$726(15)% $6,529$4,92433 % 13%11%15CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile on CCB, see pages 80–91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report and the Introduction on page 4 of this Form 10-Q.Selected income statement data    Three months ended March 31,(in millions, except ratios)2013 2012 ChangeRevenue     Lending- and deposit-related fees$723 $753 (4)%Asset management, administration and commissions533 535 —Mortgage fees and related income1,450 2,008 (28)Card income1,362 1,263 8All other income338 416 (19)Noninterest revenue4,406 4,975 (11)Net interest income7,209 7,388 (2)Total net revenue11,615 12,363 (6)      Provision for credit losses549 642 (14)      Noninterest expense     Compensation expense3,006 2,819 7Noncompensation expense3,676 4,072 (10)Amortization of intangibles108 147 (27)Total noninterest expense6,790 7,038 (4)Income before income tax expense4,276 4,683 (9)Income tax expense1,690 1,747 (3)Net income$2,586 $2,936 (12)%      Financial ratios     Return on common equity23% 27%  Overhead ratio58 57  Quarterly resultsConsumer & Community Banking net income was $2.6 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $11.6 billion, a decrease of $748 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.2 billion, down $179 million, or 2%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.4 billion, a decrease of $569 million, or 11%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income.The provision for credit losses was $549 million, compared with $642 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $1.7 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $1.8 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $2.4 billion. For more information, including net charge-off amounts and rates, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–65 of this Form 10-Q. Noninterest expense was $6.8 billion, a decrease of $248 million from the prior year. The prior year included approximately $200 million for foreclosure-related matters, including adjustments for the global settlement with federal and state agencies.Selected metrics     As of or for the three months ended March 31,(in millions, except headcount)2013 2012 ChangeSelected balance sheet data (period-end)     Total assets$458,902 $469,084 (2)%Loans:     Loans retained393,575 413,373 (5)Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(a)16,277 13,352 22Total loans409,852 426,725 (4)Deposits457,176 415,942 10Equity46,000 43,000 7Selected balance sheet data (average)     Total assets$463,527 $471,476 (2)Loans:     Loans retained397,118 418,017 (5)Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(a)21,181 16,442 29Total loans418,299 434,459 (4)Deposits441,335 401,580 10Equity46,000 43,000 7      Headcount161,123 162,970 (1)%(a)Predominantly consists of prime mortgages originated with the intent to sell that are accounted for at fair value and classified as trading assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.16Selected metrics     As of or for the three months ended March 31,(in millions, except ratios and where otherwise noted)2013 2012 ChangeCredit data and quality statistics     Net charge-offs$1,699 $2,392 (29)%Nonaccrual loans:     Nonaccrual loans retained8,996 8,395 7Nonaccrual loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value42 101 (58)Total nonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)9,038 8,496 6Nonperforming assets(a)(b)(c)(d)9,708 9,351 4Allowance for loan losses16,599 21,508 (23)Net charge-off rate(e)1.74% 2.30%  Net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans(e)2.04 2.72  Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained4.22 5.20  Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding PCI loans(f)3.25 4.52  Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans retained, excluding credit card(a)(d)(f)65 114  Nonaccrual loans to total period-end loans, excluding credit card(d)3.14 2.82  Nonaccrual loans to total period-end loans, excluding credit card and PCI loans(a)(d)3.94 3.58  Business metrics     Number of:     Branches5,632 5,541 2ATMs18,830 17,654 7Active online customers (in thousands)32,281 30,680 5Active mobile customers (in thousands)13,263 10,016 32 %(a)Excludes PCI loans.

Including CDI amortization expense in the overhead ratio calculation would result in a higher overhead ratio in the earlier years and a lower overhead ratio in later years; this method would therefore result in an improving overhead ratio over time, all things remaining equal. This non-GAAP ratio excluded CBB’s CDI amortization expense related to prior business combination transactions of $41 million and $51 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Quarterly resultsConsumer & Business Banking net income was $641 million, a decrease of $133 million, or 17%, compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower noninterest expense and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $4.2 billion, down 2% compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $2.6 billion, down 4% compared with the prior year, driven by the impact of lower deposit margins and fewer days in the period, largely offset by the impact of higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by higher debit card revenue and investment sales revenue, largely offset by lower deposit-related fees.The provision for credit losses was $61 million, compared with $96 million in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $61 million compared with $96 million in the prior year.Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, up 6% from the prior year, primarily driven by investments, including new branch builds, and a one-time cost related to a contract renegotiation.17Selected metrics    As of or for the three months ended March 31,(in millions, except ratios and where otherwise noted)2013 2012 ChangeBusiness metrics     Business banking origination volume$1,234 $1,540 (20)%Period-end loans18,739 17,822 5Period-end deposits:     Checking180,326 159,075 13Savings227,162 200,662 13Time and other30,431 35,643 (15)Total period-end deposits437,919 395,380 11Average loans18,711 17,667 6Average deposits:     Checking168,697 147,455 14Savings221,394 197,199 12Time and other31,029 36,123 (14)Total average deposits421,120 380,777 11Deposit margin2.36% 2.68%  Average assets$36,302 $30,911 17Credit data and quality statistics    Net charge-offs$61 $96 (36)Net charge-off rate1.32% 2.19%  Allowance for loan losses$698 $798 (13)Nonperforming assets465 663 (30)Retail branch business metrics    Investment sales volume$9,220 $6,598 40Client investment assets168,527 147,083 15% managed accounts31% 26%  Number of:     Chase Private Client branch locations1,392 366 280Personal bankers23,130 24,198 (4)Sales specialists6,102 6,110 —Client advisors2,998 3,131 (4)Chase Private Clients134,206 32,857 308Accounts (in thousands)(a)28,530 27,034 6 %(a) Includes checking accounts and Chase LiquidSM cards (launched in the second quarter of 2012).

Noninterest revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $596 million, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income.The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $198 million, compared with a benefit of $192 million in the prior year. The current quarter reflected a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses.Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $337 million from with the prior year, due to lower servicing expense.18Functional resultsThree months ended March 31,(in millions, except ratios)2013 2012 ChangeMortgage Production     Production revenue$995 $1,432 (31)%Production-related net interest & other income223 187 19Production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses1,218 1,619 (25)Production expense(a)710 573 24Income, excluding repurchase losses508 1,046 (51)Repurchase losses(81) (302) 73Income before income tax expense427 744 (43)      Mortgage Servicing     Loan servicing revenue936 1,039 (10)Servicing-related net interest & other income100 112 (11)Servicing-related revenue1,036 1,151 (10)MSR asset modeled amortization(258) (351) 26Default servicing expense497 890 (44)Core servicing expense240 261 (8)Income/(loss), excluding MSR risk management41 (351) NMMSR risk management, including related net interest income/(expense)(142) 191 NMIncome/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)(101) (160) 37Real Estate Portfolios     Noninterest revenue(17) 8 NMNet interest income962 1,073 (10)Total net revenue945 1,081 (13)      Provision for credit losses(202) (192) (5)      Noninterest expense363 419 (13)Income before income tax expense784 854 (8)Mortgage Banking income before income tax expense$1,110 $1,438 (23)Mortgage Banking net income$673 $979 (31)%      Overhead ratios     Mortgage Production62% 44%  Mortgage Servicing116 116  Real Estate Portfolios38 39  (a)Includes provision for credit losses associated with Mortgage Production.

Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $401 million, or 25%, from the prior year. These results reflected lower margins on tightening in primary/secondary spreads, as well as pricing pressure due to increased capacity in the market, partially offset by higher volumes. Production expense was $710 million, an increase of $137 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher volumes. Repurchase losses were $81 million, compared with $302 million in the prior year. The current quarter reflected a $100 million reduction in the repurchase liability and lower realized repurchase losses compared with prior year, primarily driven by a decline in outstanding repurchase demands. For further information, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 38–41 of this Form 10-Q.Mortgage Servicing pretax loss was $101 million, compared with a pretax loss of $160 million in the prior year. Mortgage servicing revenue, including amortization, was $778 million, a decrease of $22 million, or 3%, from the prior year reflecting lower loan servicing revenue due to lower average third-party mortgage loans serviced. 19Mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) risk management was a loss of $142 million, compared with MSR risk management income of $191 million in the prior year, largely due to prepayment model assumption updates, primarily driven by an improvement in housing price appreciation assumptions. See Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges. Servicing expense was $737 million, a decrease of $414 million from the prior year, which reflected the impact of approximately $200 million for foreclosure-related matters in the prior year and lower servicing headcount.Real Estate Portfolios pretax income was $784 million, compared with $854 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $945 million, a decrease of $136 million, or 13%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income, resulting from lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. The provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $202 million, compared with a benefit of $192 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends, primarily in the home equity portfolio, including the impact of improved home prices. Current-quarter net charge-offs totaled $448 million, compared with $808 million in the prior year. See Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–65 of this Form 10-Q for the net charge-off amounts and rates. Nonaccrual loans were $7.8 billion, compared with $7.0 billion in the prior year. Excluding the impact of certain regulatory guidance, nonaccrual loans would have been $6.0 billion at March 31, 2013. Noninterest expense was $363 million, a decrease of $56 million compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower foreclosed asset expense due to lower foreclosure inventory.PCI LoansIncluded within Real Estate Portfolios are PCI loans that the Firm acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. For PCI loans, the excess of the undiscounted gross cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the loans (the “accretable yield”) is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected life of the loans.The net spread between the PCI loans and the related liabilities are expected to be relatively constant over time, except for any basis risk or other residual interest rate risk that remains and for certain changes in the accretable yield percentage (e.g., from extended loan liquidation periods and from prepayments). As of March 31, 2013, the remaining weighted-average life of the PCI loan portfolio is expected to be 8 years. The loan balances are expected to decline more rapidly over the next three to four years as the most troubled loans are liquidated, and more slowly thereafter as the remaining troubled borrowers have limited refinancing opportunities. Similarly, default and servicing expense are expected to be higher in the earlier years and decline over time as liquidations slow down. To date the impact of the PCI loans on Real Estate Portfolios’ net income has been negative. This is largely due to the provision for loan losses recognized subsequent to their acquisition, and the higher level of default and servicing expense associated with the portfolio. Over time, the Firm expects that this portfolio will contribute positively to net income.For further information, see Note 14, PCI loans, on pages 142–143 of this Form 10-Q.Mortgage Production and Mortgage ServicingSelected metrics As of or for the three monthsended March 31,(in millions, except ratios)2013 2012 ChangeSelected balance sheet data     Period-end loans:     Prime mortgage, including option ARMs(a)$17,257 $17,268 — %Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(b)16,277 12,496 30Average loans:     Prime mortgage, including option ARMs(a)17,554 17,238 2Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(b)21,181 15,621 36Average assets64,218 58,862 9Repurchase liability (period-end)2,430 3,213 (24)Credit data and quality statistics     Net charge-offs:     Prime mortgage, including option ARMs4 — NMNet charge-off rate:     Prime mortgage, including option ARMs0.09% —%  30+ day delinquency rate(c)3.04 3.01  Nonperforming assets(d)$643 $708 (9)%(a)Predominantly represents prime loans repurchased from Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) pools, which are insured by U.S. government agencies.

Net interest income was $3.5 billion, flat compared with the prior year. The impact of lower average credit card loan balances was offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower net charge-offs in credit card. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year. The current quarter reflected higher net interchange and merchant servicing revenue; the prior year included a gain on an investment security.The provision for credit losses was $686 million, compared with $738 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a $500 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends. The prior-year provision included a $750 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The Credit Card net charge-off rate1 was 3.55%, down from 4.37% in the prior year; and the 30+ day delinquency rate1 was 1.94%, down from 2.55% in the prior year and 2.10% at December 31, 2012. The Auto net charge-off rate was 0.32%, up from 0.28% in the prior year.Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $86 million, or 4%, from the prior year, driven by an expense recorded in the prior year related to a non-core product.1 The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented for credit card loans, which include loans held-for-sale, are non-GAAP financial measures.

These results reflected higher net revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $10.1 billion, compared with $9.3 billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $126 million gain from DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads; the prior year included a loss from DVA of $907 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, net income was $2.5 billion and net revenue was $10.0 billion, both down 2% from the prior year.Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion (up 4%), driven by higher debt underwriting fees totaling $905 million (up 11%), partially offset by lower advisory fees of $255 million (down 9%); equity underwriting fees were $273 million, flat compared with the prior year. CIB achieved record bond underwriting fees 25during the quarter, on industry-wide high-yield bond issuance that was also at record quarterly levels. Advisory fees were lower compared to prior year; however, the Firm was ranked #1 in Global Announced M&A for the first quarter of 2013 with a 30% market share, according to Dealogic. Treasury Services revenue was $1.0 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Lending revenue was $498 million, compared with $222 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by gains on securities received from restructured loans and higher net interest income on retained loans.Markets & Investor Services revenue was $7.2 billion, up 7% from the prior year. Fixed Income and Equity Markets combined revenue was $6.1 billion, down 5% from the prior year, reflecting solid client revenue, but lower rates product revenue compared with a particularly strong prior year. Equity derivatives activity within was seasonally strong and Securities Services revenue was $974 million, flat from the prior year. While a portion of Securities Services revenue reflects the depositary receipts business, the custody portion of the business has grown in line with assets under custody of $19.3 trillion, which were up 8% compared with the prior year. Credit Adjustments & Other revenue was $99 million, compared with a loss of $713 million in the prior year; both periods were driven by the impact of DVA. For information on CIB’s commodities activities, see Note 6 and Note 10 on pages 120 and 122, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.The provision for credit losses was $11 million, compared with a benefit in the prior year of $3 million. CIB continues to experience stable trends in the credit portfolio with low levels of nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 1.11%, compared with 1.34% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of Firm administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.17%, compared with 2.93% in the prior year.Noninterest expense was $6.1 billion, down 2% from the prior year, driven by lower compensation expense and lower noncompensation expense related to efficiency initiatives, largely offset by higher litigation expense. The compensation ratio for the current quarter, excluding the impact of DVA, was 34% and 35% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Return on equity was 19% on $56.5 billion of average allocated capital.

As a result, compensation expense for these sales staff is now reflected in CB’s  compensation expense rather than as an allocation from CIB in noncompensation expense. CB’s and CIB’s previously reported headcount, compensation expense and noncompensation expense have been revised to reflect this transfer.(d)Represents the total revenue related to investment banking products sold to CB clients.(e)Effective January 1, 2013, the financial results of financial institution clients were transferred to Corporate Client Banking from Middle Market Banking. Prior periods were revised to conform with this presentation.Quarterly resultsNet income was $596 million, flat compared with the prior year, reflecting a lower provision for credit losses and an increase in net revenue, predominantly offset by higher noninterest expense.Net revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of $16 million, essentially flat compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, an increase of $38 million, or 3%, driven by growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments and spread compression on loan products. Noninterest revenue was $535 million, down $22 million, or 4%, driven by lower community development investment-related revenue and lower lending-related fees.Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $753 million, an increase of $22 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $433 million, flat compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $291 million, flat compared with the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $112 million, an increase of $7 million, or 7%, from the prior year.The provision for credit losses was $39 million, compared with $77 million in the prior year. Net recoveries were $7 million (0.02% net recovery rate), compared with net charge-offs of $12 million (0.04% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 2.05%, down from 2.32% in the prior year. Nonaccrual loans were $669 million, down $335 million, or 33%, from the prior year due to repayments, charge-offs and loan sales. Noninterest expense was $644 million, an increase of $46 million, or 8%, from the prior year, reflecting higher headcount-related expense driven by expansion, portfolio growth and regulatory-related initiatives; and increased operating expense for Commercial Card.29Selected metrics      As of or for the three months endedMarch 31,(in millions, except headcount and ratios)2013 2012 ChangeSelected balance sheet data (period-end)     Total assets$184,689 $161,741 14 %Loans:     Loans retained(a)129,534 114,969 13Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value851 878 (3)Total loans$130,385 $115,847 13Equity13,500 9,500 42      Period-end loans by client segment     Middle Market Banking(b)$52,296 $45,826 14Corporate Client Banking(b)20,962 17,884 17Commercial Term Lending44,374 39,314 13Real Estate Banking9,003 8,763 3Other3,750 4,060 (8)Total Commercial Banking loans$130,385 $115,847 13      Selected balance sheet data (average)     Total assets$182,620 $161,074 13Loans:     Loans retained(a)128,490 112,879 14Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value800 881 (9)Total loans$129,290 $113,760 14Client deposits and other third-party liabilities195,968 200,178 (2)Equity13,500 9,500 42Average loans by client segment     Middle Market Banking(b)$52,013 $44,831 16Corporate Client Banking(b)21,061 17,730 19Commercial Term Lending43,845 38,848 13Real Estate Banking8,677 8,341 4Other3,694 4,010 (8)Total Commercial Banking loans$129,290 $113,760 14      Headcount(c)(d)6,511 5,866 11 %  As of or for the three months endedMarch 31,(in millions, except ratios)2013 2012 ChangeCredit data and quality statistics     Net (recoveries)/charge-offs$(7) $12 NMNonperforming assets     Nonaccrual loans:     Nonaccrual loans retained(e)643 972 (34)%Nonaccrual loans held-for-sale and loans held at fair value26 32 (19)Total nonaccrual loans669 1,004 (33)Assets acquired in loan satisfactions12 60 (80)Total nonperforming assets681 1,064 (36)Allowance for credit losses:     Allowance for loan losses2,656 2,662 —Allowance for lending-related commitments183 194 (6)Total allowance for credit losses2,839 2,856 (1)%Net (recovery)/charge-off rate(f)(0.02)% 0.04%  Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained2.05 2.32  Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans retained(e)413 274  Nonaccrual loans to total period-end loans0.51 0.87  (a)Effective January 1, 2013, whole loan financing agreements, previously reported as other assets, were reclassified as loans.

Quarterly resultsNet income was $250 million, compared with a net loss of $1.0 billion in the prior year.Private Equity reported a net loss of $182 million, compared with net income of $134 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $276 million, compared with net revenue of $254 million in the prior year, primarily due to net valuation losses on private investments.Treasury and CIO reported net income of $24 million, compared with a net loss of $227 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $113 million, compared with a loss of $233 million in the prior year. The three months ended March 31, 2012 included $1.4 billion of losses on CIO’s synthetic credit portfolio. Net revenue included net securities gains of $503 million from sales of available-for-sale investment securities during the current quarter. Net interest income was a loss of $472 million due to low interest rates and limited reinvestment opportunities.Other Corporate reported net income of $408 million in the first quarter, compared with a net loss of $929 million in the prior year. The current quarter included a benefit for tax adjustments. The prior-year noninterest revenue included a $1.1 billion benefit from the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement. The prior-year noninterest expense included $2.5 billion of additional litigation reserves.Treasury and CIO overviewTreasury and CIO are predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital and structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. For further discussion of Treasury and CIO, see page 103 of the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report.CIO achieves the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s AFS investment portfolio. CIO also uses derivatives, as well as securities that are not classified within the AFS portfolio, to meet the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives. For further information on derivatives, see Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q. For further information about securities not classified within the AFS portfolio, see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q. CIO’s AFS portfolio consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities and corporate and municipal debt securities. Treasury’s AFS portfolio consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities and corporate debt securities. At March 31, 2013, the total Treasury and CIO AFS portfolio was $360.2 billion; the average credit rating of the 33securities comprising the CIO and Treasury AFS portfolios was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). See Note 11 on pages 123–126 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the details of the Firm’s AFS portfolio.For further information on liquidity and funding risk, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–54 of this Form 10-Q.

The decrease in carrying value was predominantly driven by net valuation losses on private investments. The portfolio represented 4.9% of the Firm’s stockholders’ equity less goodwill at March 31, 2013, down from 5.2% at December 31, 2012.34INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSDuring the three months ended March 31, 2013, and 2012, the Firm recorded approximately $7.0 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of managed revenue derived from clients, customers and counterparties domiciled outside of North America. Of those amounts, approximately 69% and 61%, respectively, were derived from Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”); approximately 22% and 28%, respectively, from Asia/Pacific; and approximately 9% and 11%, respectively, from Latin America/Caribbean. For additional information regarding international operations, see Note 32 on page 326 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.International wholesale activitiesThe Firm is committed to further expanding its wholesale business activities outside of the United States, and it  continues to add additional client-serving bankers, as well as product and sales support personnel, to address the needs of the Firm’s clients located in these regions. With a comprehensive and coordinated international business strategy and growth plan, efforts and investments for growth outside of the United States continue to be prioritized.Set forth below are certain key metrics related to the Firm’s wholesale international operations, including, for each of EMEA, Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean, the number of countries in each such region in which they operate, front-office headcount, number of clients, revenue and selected balance-sheet data.

The increase in total assets was due to higher deposits with banks, reflecting placement of the Firm’s excess funds with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks; the increase was offset partially by lower securities purchased under resale agreements, due primarily to a shift in the deployment of  the Firm’s excess funds. The increase in total liabilities was related to higher long-term debt from net new issuances and higher deposits. The increase in stockholders’ equity was predominantly due to net income.The following is a discussion of the significant changes in the specific line item captions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31, 2012.Cash and due from banks and deposits with banksThe net increase reflected the placement of the Firm’s excess funds with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 49–54 of this Form 10-Q.Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements; and securities borrowedThe decrease in securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed was due primarily to a shift in the deployment of the Firm’s excess cash by Treasury.Trading assets and liabilities–debt and equity instrumentsThe decrease in trading assets was driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB, which resulted in lower levels of equity securities and physical commodities partially offset by increase in debt instruments. For additional information, refer to Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q.Trading assets and liabilities–derivative receivables and payablesDerivative receivables decreased primarily due to the increase in interest rates and depreciation of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. The changes resulted in reductions to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts. Decreases were partially offset by increased equity and credit derivative receivables.Derivative payables decreased primarily due to the increase in interest rates and depreciation of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. The changes resulted in reductions to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts. Decreases were partially offset by increased equity and credit derivative payables.For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on page 72, and Notes 3 and 5 on pages 96–107 and 109–119, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.36SecuritiesSecurities decreased largely due to repositioning of the CIO AFS portfolio, which resulted in lower levels of non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), corporate debt, asset-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities; the decrease was partially offset by higher levels in non-U.S. government securities and U.S. government agency-issued MBS. For additional information related to securities, refer to the discussion in the Corporate/Private Equity segment on pages 33–34, and Notes 3 and 11 on pages 96–107 and 123–126, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Loans and allowance for loan lossesLoan balances decreased as a result of lower credit card loans, due to seasonality and higher repayment rates; and lower consumer excluding credit card loans, predominantly due to mortgage-related paydowns, portfolio run-off and net charge-offs. The decrease was partially offset by growth in wholesale loans, primarily in CIB and CB. The increase in wholesale loans was driven by activity across most of the Firm’s regions and businesses.The allowance for loan losses decreased, predominantly related to a $1.2 billion reduction due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, and also the impact of improved home prices in the residential real estate portfolio.For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 55–76, and Notes 3, 4, 13 and 14 on pages 96–107, 107–108, 129–149 and 150, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Accrued interest and accounts receivableThe increase in accrued interest and accounts receivable was due to a rise in margin loans balances driven by client activity, primarily in CIB, and the timing of merchant receivables payments related to CCB’s Card Services business.Mortgage servicing rightsThe increase in the MSR asset was due to originations and changes in market interest rates. This increase was partially offset by dispositions, amortization and other changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q. DepositsThe increase in deposits was due to growth in consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in deposit balances in the wholesale businesses. Consumer deposit balances increased from the combined effect of seasonal factors, such as tax refunds and bonus payments, and general growth in business volumes. The decrease in wholesale client balances was due to a decline in client balances, particularly in CB and AM, reflecting normalization of deposit levels from year-end seasonal inflows. For more information on deposits, refer to the CCB and AM segment discussions on pages 16–24 and 31–32, respectively; the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 49–54; and Notes 3 and 17 on pages 96–107 and 162, respectively, of this Form 10-Q. For more information on wholesale client deposits, refer to the CB and CIB segment discussions on pages 29–30 and 25–28, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreementsThe increase was predominantly due to higher secured financing of the Firm’s assets and higher client financing activity. For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, see pages 49–54 of this Form 10-Q.Commercial paper and other borrowed fundsCommercial paper increased due to higher commercial paper issuance, partially offset by a decline in the volume of liability balances related to CIB’s liquidity management product. Other borrowed funds increased due to higher unsecured and secured short-term borrowings. For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management and other borrowed funds, see pages 49–54 of this Form 10-Q.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEsBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased primarily due to credit card maturities, unwinds of municipal bond vehicles and a reduction in outstanding conduit commercial paper held by third parties, partially offset by new credit card issuances. For additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, see Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q.Long-term debtLong-term debt increased, primarily due to net issuances of long-term borrowings. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt activities, see the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 49–54 of this Form 10-Q.Stockholders’ equityTotal stockholders’ equity increased, predominantly due to net income and issuance of preferred stock. The increase was partially offset by repurchases of common equity and the declaration of cash dividends on common and preferred stock.37OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSJPMorgan Chase is involved with several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). For further discussion, see Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Cash Obligations on pages 109–115 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Special-purpose entitiesThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, including the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees. For further information on the types of SPEs, see Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 1 on pages 193–194 and Note 16 on pages 280–291 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Implications of a credit rating downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., could be required to provide funding if its short-term credit rating were downgraded below specific levels, primarily “P-1,” “A-1” and “F1” for Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, respectively. These liquidity commitments support the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by both Firm-administered consolidated and third-party-sponsored nonconsolidated SPEs. In the event of a short-term credit rating downgrade, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., absent other solutions, would be required to provide funding to the SPE, if the commercial paper could not be reissued as it matured. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding, issued by both Firm-administered and third-party-sponsored SPEs, that are held by third parties as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, was $17.4 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding could increase in future periods should clients of the Firm-administered consolidated or third-party-sponsored nonconsolidated SPEs draw down on certain unfunded lending-related commitments. Unfunded lending-related commitments were $10.9 billion at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. The Firm could facilitate the refinancing of some of the clients’ assets in order to reduce the funding obligation. Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees and the Firm’s related accounting policies, see Lending-related commitments on page 71, and Note 21 (including a table that presents, as of March 31, 2013, the amounts, by contractual maturity, of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments) on pages 166–170 of this Form 10-Q. For a discussion of loan repurchase liabilities, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 38–41and Note 21 on pages 166–170 of this Form 10-Q.Mortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”) and other mortgage loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties. To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. For additional information regarding loans sold to the GSEs, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 111–115 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm also sells loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another government agency. The Firm, in its role as servicer, may voluntarily repurchase certain delinquent loans from loan pools, including those that have been sold back to Ginnie Mae subsequent to modification, as permitted by Ginnie Mae guidelines. However, the Firm is typically not required to repurchase such loans other than for modification or foreclosure purposes (i.e., these repurchases typically do not result from repurchase demands due to breaches of representations and warranties). Because principal amounts due under the 38terms of these repurchased loans continue to be insured and the reimbursement of insured amounts continues to proceed normally, the Firm has not recorded any mortgage repurchase liability related to these loans. However, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm’s compliance with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration’s Direct Endorsement Program. The Firm is cooperating in that investigation.From 2005 to 2008, the Firm and certain acquired entities made certain loan level representations and warranties in connection with approximately $450 billion of residential mortgage loans that were sold or deposited into private-label securitizations. While the terms of the securitization transactions vary, they generally differ from loan sales to the GSEs in that, among other things: (i) in order to direct the trustee to investigate potential claims, the security holders must make a formal request for the trustee to do so, and typically, this requires agreement of the holders of a specified percentage of the outstanding securities; (ii) generally, the mortgage loans are not required to meet all GSE eligibility criteria; and (iii) in many cases, the party demanding repurchase is required to demonstrate that a loan-level breach of a representation or warranty has materially and adversely affected the value of the loan. Of the $450 billion originally sold or deposited (including $165 billion by Washington Mutual, as to which the Firm maintains that certain of the repurchase obligations remain with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) receivership), approximately $199 billion of principal has been repaid (including $73 billion related to Washington Mutual). In addition, approximately $122 billion of the principal amount of such loans has been liquidated (including $44 billion related to Washington Mutual), with an average loss severity of 60%. Accordingly, the remaining outstanding principal balance of these loans (including Washington Mutual) was, as of March 31, 2013, approximately $129 billion, of which $36 billion was 60 days or more past due. The remaining outstanding principal balance of loans related to Washington Mutual was approximately $48 billion, of which $13 billion were 60 days or more past due. For additional information regarding loans sold to private investors, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 111–115 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. There have been generalized allegations, as well as specific demands, that the Firm repurchase loans sold or deposited into private-label securitizations (including claims from insurers that have guaranteed certain obligations of the securitization trusts). Although the Firm encourages parties to use the contractual repurchase process established in the governing agreements, these private-label repurchase claims have generally manifested themselves through threatened or pending litigation. Accordingly, the liability related to repurchase demands associated with all of the private-label securitizations described above is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 on pages 170–179 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 31 on pages 316–325 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Estimated mortgage repurchase liabilityThe Firm has recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability is intended to cover losses associated with all loans previously sold in connection with loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs, regardless of when those losses occur or how they are ultimately resolved (e.g., repurchase, make-whole payment). While uncertainties continue to exist with respect to both GSE behavior and the economic environment, the Firm believes that the model inputs and assumptions that it uses to estimate its mortgage repurchase liability are becoming increasingly seasoned and stable. Based on these model inputs, which take into account all available information, and also considering projections regarding future uncertainty, including the GSEs’ current behavior, the Firm has become increasingly confident in its ability to estimate reliably its mortgage repurchase liability. For these reasons, the Firm believes that its mortgage repurchase liability at March 31, 2013, is sufficient to cover probable future repurchase losses arising from loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs. For additional information about the process that the Firm uses to estimate its mortgage repurchase liability and the factors it considers in connection with that process, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 111–115 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.39The following table provides information about outstanding repurchase demands and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices, excluding those related to Washington Mutual, by counterparty type, at each of the past five quarter-end dates. The table includes repurchase demands received from the GSEs as well as repurchase demands that have been presented to the Firm by trustees who assert authority to present such claims under the terms of the underlying sale or securitization agreement.The table excludes repurchase demands asserted in or in connection with pending repurchase litigation. All mortgage repurchase demands associated with private-label securitizations (however asserted) are evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves; they are not considered in the Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability. Accordingly, as noted above, the Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability is intended to cover losses associated with all loans previously sold in connection with loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs.Outstanding repurchase demands and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices by counterparty type (in millions)Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012 Sep 30, 2012 Jun 30, 2012 Mar 31, 2012 GSEs$1,022 $1,166 $1,533 $1,646 $1,868 Mortgage insurers924 1,014 1,036 1,004 1,000 Other992 887(b) 1,697 981 756 Overlapping population(a)(64) (86) (150) (125) (116) Total$2,874 $2,981 $4,116 $3,506 $3,508 (a)Because the GSEs and others may make repurchase demands based on mortgage insurance rescission notices that remain unresolved, certain loans may be subject to both an unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notice and an outstanding repurchase demand.(b)The decrease from September 30, 2012 predominantly relates to repurchase demands from private-label securitizations that had been presented in this table as of September 30, 2012 but that subsequently became subject to repurchase litigation in the fourth quarter of 2012; such repurchase demands are excluded from this table.The following tables provide information about repurchase demands and mortgage insurance rescission notices received by loan origination vintage, excluding those related to Washington Mutual, for the past five quarters. The Firm expects repurchase demands to remain at elevated levels or to increase if there is a significant increase in private-label repurchase demands outside of pending repurchase litigation. Additionally, repurchase demands from the GSEs continue to fluctuate from period to period, as reflected in the table immediately below. The Firm considers future repurchase demands, including this potential volatility, in estimating its mortgage repurchase liability.Quarterly mortgage repurchase demands received by loan origination vintage(a) (in millions)Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012 Sep 30, 2012 Jun 30, 2012 Mar 31, 2012 Pre-2005$45 $42 $33 $28 $41 2005217(b) 42 103 65 95 2006287 292 963 506 375 2007419 241 371 420 645 2008151 114 196 311 361 Post-200862 87 124 191 124 Total repurchase demands received$1,181 $818 $1,790 $1,521 $1,641 (a)All mortgage repurchase demands associated with private-label securitizations are separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.

This table includes mortgage insurance rescission notices for which the GSEs also have issued a repurchase demand.40Since the beginning of 2011, the Firm’s cumulative cure rate (excluding loans originated by Washington Mutual) has been approximately 60%. A significant portion of repurchase demands currently relate to loans with a longer pay history, which historically have had higher cure rates. Repurchases that have resulted from mortgage insurance rescissions are reflected in the Firm’s overall cure rate. While the actual cure rate may vary from quarter to quarter, the Firm expects that the cumulative cure rate will remain in the 55-65% range for the foreseeable future.The Firm has not observed a direct relationship between the type of defect that allegedly causes the breach of representations and warranties and the severity of the realized loss. Therefore, the loss severity assumption is estimated using the Firm’s historical experience and projections regarding changes in home prices. Actual principal loss severities on finalized repurchases and “make-whole” settlements to date (excluding loans originated by Washington Mutual) currently average approximately 50%, but may vary from quarter to quarter based on the characteristics of the underlying loans and changes in home prices.When a loan was originated by a third-party originator, the Firm typically has the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third-party originator. Estimated and actual third-party recovery rates may vary from quarter to quarter based upon the underlying mix of third-party originators (e.g., active, inactive, out-of-business originators) from which recoveries are being sought.Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firm’s established methodology for computing its recorded mortgage repurchase liability — including the amount of probable future demands from the GSEs (based on both historical experience and the Firm’s expectations about the GSEs’ future behavior), the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure and recoveries from third parties — require application of a significant level of management judgment. While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its mortgage repurchase liability, this estimate is inherently uncertain and imprecise.The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability(a) Three months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Repurchase liability at beginning of period$2,811 $3,557Net realized losses(b)(212) (364)Provision for repurchase losses(c)75 323Repurchase liability at end of period$2,674 $3,516(a)All mortgage repurchase demands associated with private-label securitizations are separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.(b)Realized repurchase losses are presented net of third-party recoveries and include principal losses and accrued interest on repurchased  loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expense. Make-whole settlements were $121 million and $186 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(c)Included $8 million and $27 million of provision related to new loan sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.The following table summarizes the total unpaid principal balance of certain repurchases during the periods indicated.Unpaid principal balance of mortgage loan repurchases(a) Three months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Ginnie Mae(b)$2,151 $1,507GSEs(c)245 319Other(c)(d)26 60Total$2,422 $1,886(a)This table includes: (i) repurchases of mortgage loans due to breaches of representations and warranties, and (ii) loans repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools as described in (b) below. This table does not include mortgage insurance rescissions; while the rescission of mortgage insurance typically results in a repurchase demand from the GSEs, the mortgage insurers themselves do not present repurchase demands to the Firm. This table also excludes mortgage loan repurchases associated with repurchase demands asserted in or in connection with pending repurchase litigation.(b)In substantially all cases, these repurchases represent either voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Ginnie Mae guidelines or required repurchases of loans for modification or foreclosure purposes (i.e., these repurchases typically do not result from repurchase demands due to breaches of representations and warranties). The Firm typically repurchases these loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable policies and requirements of Ginnie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Rural Housing Services (“RHS”) and/or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”).(c)Nonaccrual loans held-for-investment included $458 million and $478 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of loans repurchased as a result of breaches of representations and warranties.(d)Represents loans repurchased from parties other than the GSEs, excluding those repurchased in connection with pending repurchase litigation.For additional information regarding the mortgage repurchase liability, see Note 21 on pages 166–170 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 on pages 308–315 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm also faces a variety of exposures resulting from repurchase demands and litigation arising out of its various roles as issuer and/or sponsor of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) offerings in private-label securitizations. For further information, see Note 23, Litigation on pages 170–179 of this Form 10-Q.41CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s capital management highlights developments since December 31, 2012, and should be read in conjunction with Capital Management on pages 116–122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm’s capital management objectives are to hold capital sufficient to:•Cover all material risks underlying the Firm’s business activities;•Maintain “well-capitalized” status under regulatory requirements;•Maintain debt ratings that enable the Firm to optimize its funding mix and liquidity sources while minimizing costs;•Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities; and•Build and invest in businesses, even in a highly stressed environment.These objectives are achieved through ongoing monitoring of the Firm’s capital position, regular stress testing, and a capital governance framework.Capital governanceThe Firm’s senior management recognizes the importance of a capital management function that supports strategic decision-making. For a more detailed discussion of the Firm’s capital governance and processes, see pages 116-117 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Comprehensive Capital Analysis and ReviewOn January 7, 2013, the Firm submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2013 CCAR process. On March 14, 2013, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2013 capital plan, but asked the Firm to submit an additional capital plan , as described more fully below. Following this notification, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors intends to increase the second-quarter common stock dividend to $0.38 per share from the current $0.30 per share, returning the dividend to its highest level. The Board of Directors has also authorized the Firm to repurchase up to $6 billion of common equity commencing with the second quarter of this year through the end of the first quarter of 2014.The Federal Reserve has asked the Firm to submit by the end of the third quarter of 2013 an additional capital plan addressing the weaknesses it identified in the Firm’s CCAR capital planning processes. The Firm intends to fully address the Federal Reserve’s requirements. Following its review, the Federal Reserve may require the Firm to modify its capital distributions. Regulatory capitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A.In connection with the U.S. Government’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009 (“SCAP”), U.S. banking regulators developed an additional measure of capital, Tier 1 common, which is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred securities. The Federal Reserve employs a minimum 5% Tier 1 common ratio standard for CCAR purposes, in addition to the other minimum capital requirements.Basel I and Basel 2.5The minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies follow the Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). In June 2012, U.S. federal banking agencies published the final rule that specifies revised market risk regulatory capital requirements (“Basel 2.5”). While the Firm is still subject to the capital requirements of Basel I, Basel 2.5 rules also became effective for the Firm on January 1, 2013. The Basel 2.5 final rule revised the scope of positions subject to the market risk capital requirements and introduced new market risk measures, which resulted in additional capital requirements for trading positions and securitizations. The implementation of these rules in the first quarter of 2013 resulted in an increase to risk-weighted assets of approximately $150 billion, resulting in a decrease in the Firm’s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 common capital ratios by 140 basis points, 160 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2013.42The following table presents the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, under Basel I (and, for March 31, 2013, Basel 2.5). As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and each met all capital requirements to which it was subject.Risk-based capital ratios    March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Capital ratios   Tier 1 capital11.6% 12.6%Total capital14.1 15.3Tier 1 leverage7.3 7.1Tier 1 common(a)10.2 11.0(a)The Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by RWA.At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase maintained Tier 1 and Total capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve, as indicated in the above tables. In addition, at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm’s Tier 1 common ratio was significantly above the 5% CCAR standard. For more information, see Note 28 on pages 306–308 of the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report.

The change in RWA is primarily attributable to the implementation of Basel 2.5.Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios and the federal regulatory capital standards to which it is subject is presented in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 8–21 of the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report, and Note 20 on pages 164–166 of this Form 10-Q. Basel IIIn 2004, the Basel Committee published a revision to the Capital Accord (“Basel II”). The goal of the Basel II framework is to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. U.S. banking regulators published a final Basel II rule in December 2007, which requires JPMorgan Chase to implement Basel II at the holding company level, as well as at certain of its key U.S. bank subsidiaries.Prior to full implementation of the Basel II framework, JPMorgan Chase is required to complete a qualification period of at least four consecutive quarters during which it needs to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of its U.S. banking regulators. JPMorgan Chase is currently in the qualification period and expects to be in compliance with all relevant Basel II rules within the established timelines. In addition, the Firm has adopted, and will continue to adopt, based on various established timelines, Basel II rules in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, as required.Basel IIIIn June 2012, U.S. federal banking agencies published a Notice for Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”) for implementing further revisions to the Capital Accord in the U.S. (such further revisions are commonly referred to as “Basel III”). Basel III revised Basel II by, among other things, narrowing the definition of capital, and increasing capital requirements for specific exposures. Basel III also includes higher capital ratio requirements and provides that the Tier 1 common capital requirement will be increased to 7%, comprised of a minimum ratio of 4.5% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer. Implementation of the 7% Tier 1 common capital requirement is required by January 1, 2019.In addition, global systemically important banks (“GSIBs”) will be required to maintain Tier 1 common requirements above the 7% minimum in amounts ranging from an additional 1% to an additional 2.5%. In November 2012, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) indicated that it would require the Firm, as well as three other banks, to hold the additional 2.5% of Tier 1 common; the requirement will be phased in beginning in 2016. The Basel Committee also stated it intended to require certain GSIBs to hold an additional 1% of Tier 1 common under certain circumstances, to act as a disincentive for the GSIB from taking actions that would further increase its systemic importance. Currently, no GSIB (including the Firm) is required to hold this additional 1% of Tier 1 common.In addition, pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. federal banking agencies have proposed certain permanent Basel I floors under Basel II and Basel III capital calculations.44The following table presents a comparison of the Firm’s Tier 1 common under Basel I rules to its estimated Tier 1 common under Basel III rules, along with the Firm’s estimated risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common under Basel III includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in Basel I Tier 1 common, such as the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) related to AFS securities and defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit (“OPEB”) plans.The Firm estimates that its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules would be 8.9% as of March 31, 2013. The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are non-GAAP financial measures. However, such measures are used by bank regulators, investors and analysts as a key measure to assess the Firm’s capital position and to compare the Firm’s capital to that of other financial services companies.March 31, 2013(in millions, except ratio) Tier 1 common under Basel I rules$143,255Adjustments related to AOCI for AFS securities and defined benefit pension and OPEB plans3,541All other adjustments(313)Estimated Tier 1 common under Basel III rules$146,483Estimated risk-weighted assets under Basel III rules(a)$1,653,613Estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules(b)8.9%(a)Key differences in the calculation of risk-weighted assets between Basel I and Basel III include: (1) Basel III credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas Basel I RWA is based on fixed supervisory risk-weightings which vary only by counterparty type and asset class; and (2) Basel III includes RWA for operational risk, whereas Basel I does not. Effective January 1, 2013, market risk RWA requirements under Basel 2.5 are consistent across Basel I and Basel III.(b)The Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by RWA.The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III reflects its current understanding of the Basel III rules based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies and on the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted. The actual impact on the Firm’s capital ratios upon implementation of Basel III rules may differ from the Firm’s current estimates. The actual impact could depend on changes the Firm may make to its businesses in the future as a result of implementing the Basel III rules, regulatory approval of certain of the Firm’s internal risk models, and any further implementation guidance from the regulators.The Basel III capital requirements are subject to prolonged transition periods. The transition period for banks to meet the Tier 1 common requirement under Basel III was originally scheduled to begin in 2013, with full implementation on January 1, 2019. In November 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies announced a delay in the implementation dates for the Basel III capital requirements. The additional capital requirements for GSIBs will be phased in starting January 1, 2016, with full implementation on January 1, 2019. Management’s current objective is for the  Firm to reach, by the end of 2013, an estimated Basel III Tier I common ratio of 9.5%.Broker-dealer regulatory capitalJPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“JPMorgan Securities”) and J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. (“JPMorgan Clearing”). JPMorgan Clearing is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Securities and provides clearing and settlement services. JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are each subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are also each registered as futures commission merchants and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing have elected to compute their minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital Rule. At March 31, 2013, JPMorgan Securities’ net capital, as defined by the Net Capital Rule, was $13.5 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $11.9 billion, and JPMorgan Clearing’s net capital was $6.7 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $4.9 billion.In addition to its minimum net capital requirement, JPMorgan Securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the SEC in the event that tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion, in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. As of March 31, 2013, JPMorgan Securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.J.P. Morgan Securities plc (formerly J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and is the Firm’s principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. It has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) (together, formerly the U.K. Financial Services Authority). At March 31, 2013, J.P. Morgan Securities plc had total capital of $21.5 billion, or a Total capital ratio of 14.8%, which exceeded the 8% well-capitalized standard applicable to it under Basel 2.5.45Economic risk capitalThe Firm measures economic capital using internal risk-assessment methodologies and models primarily based on four risk factors: credit, market, operational and private equity risk. The growth in economic risk capital for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was predominantly driven by: an increase in operational risk capital due to the annual update of external operational risk loss data, which reflected more severe losses experienced in the financial industry; an increase in credit risk capital driven by the addition of previously excluded non-modeled portfolios and an increase in the capital for run-off portfolios in Mortgage Banking. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in market risk capital driven by roll off of positions as well as active risk reductions.

Capital is also allocated to each line of business for, among other things, goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business.

The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses is largely driven by the most current regulatory guidance on Basel III requirements (including the NPR), principally for CIB and CIO, and by anticipated business growth.46Capital actionsDividendsOn March 14, 2013, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors intends to increase the Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.38 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July 31, 2013, to shareholders of record on July 5, 2013. On March 19, 2013, the Board of Directors declared its regular quarterly common stock dividend of $0.30 per share payable on April 30, 2013, to stockholders of record on April 5, 2013. The Firm’s common stock dividend policy reflects JPMorgan Chase’s earnings outlook, desired dividend payout ratio, capital objectives, and alternative investment opportunities. The Firm’s current expectation is to return to a payout ratio of approximately 30% of normalized earnings over time.For information regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22 and Note 27 on pages 300 and 306, respectively, of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Issuance of preferred stockOn February 5, 2013, and April 23, 2013, the Firm issued $900 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, of noncumulative preferred stock. For additional information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 300 of the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report.Common equity repurchasesOn March 13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Firm repurchased (on a trade-date basis) an aggregate of 54 million and 4 million shares, respectively, of common stock for $2.6 billion and $190 million, respectively. The Firm did not repurchase any warrants during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. As of March 31, 2013, $10.8 billion (on a trade-date basis)of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. The Firm is authorized to repurchase up to $6 billion of common equity between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. Such repurchases will be done pursuant to the $15.0 billion common equity repurchase program.The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading “black-out periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, on page 190 of this Form 10-Q.47RISK MANAGEMENTRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. The Firm’s risk management framework and governance structure are intended to provide comprehensive controls and ongoing management of the major risks inherent in its business activities. The Firm employs a holistic approach to risk management intended to ensure the broad spectrum of risk types are considered in managing its business activities. The Firm’s risk management framework is intended to create a culture of risk awareness and personal responsibility throughout the Firm where collaboration, discussion, escalation and sharing of information are encouraged. The Firm’s overall risk appetite is established in the context of the Firm’s capital, earnings power, and diversified business model. The Firm employs a formalized risk appetite framework to integrate the Firm’s objectives with  return targets, risk controls and capital management. The Risk Policy Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors approves the risk appetite policy on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) or Deputy CRO, and Chief Operating Officer (responsible for Treasury and Funding) are responsible for setting and approving the Firm’s risk appetite parameters. The lines of business CEOs, CFOs and CROs are responsible for setting the risk appetite parameters for their respective lines of business, subject to approval by the Firm’s CEO, CRO or Deputy CRO and Chief Operating Officer. The Risk Governance Committee, which is chaired by the CRO, is responsible for ensuring that reporting and compliance with the stated risk appetite is monitored at the LOB and firmwide levels per policy.The following provides an index of key risk management disclosures.

The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to ensure that the Firm’s core businesses are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during market stress events and to maintain debt ratings that enable the Firm to optimize its funding mix and liquidity sources while minimizing costs. The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Liquidity Risk Management framework highlights developments since December 31, 2012, and should be read in conjunction with pages 127–133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Management considers the Firm’s liquidity position to be strong as of March 31, 2013, and believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.LCR and NSFRIn December 2010, the Basel Committee introduced two new measures of liquidity risk: the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) which is intended to measure the amount of “high-quality liquid assets” (“HQLA”) held by the Firm during an acute stress, in relation to the estimated net cash outflows within a 30-day period; and the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) which is intended to measure the “available” amount of stable funding relative to the “required” amount of stable funding over a 1-year horizon. The standards require that the LCR be no lower than 100% and the NSFR be greater than 100%. For further discussion, see HQLA discussion on page 52 of this Form 10-Q. In January 2013, the Basel Committee introduced certain amendments to the formulation of the LCR, and a revised timetable to phase-in the standard. The LCR will continue to become effective on January 1, 2015, but the minimum requirement will begin at 60%, increasing in equal annual stages to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. The Firm is currently targeting to attain a 100% LCR, based on its current understanding of the requirements, by the end of 2013. The NSFR is scheduled to become effective in 2018.FundingSources of fundsDepositsA key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. As of March 31, 2013, the Firm’s deposits-to-loans ratio was 165%, compared with 163% at December 31, 2012. As of March 31, 2013, total deposits for the Firm were $1,202.5 billion, compared with $1,193.6 billion at December 31, 2012 (55% of total liabilities at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012). The increase in deposits was predominantly due to growth in retail deposits. For further information, see Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 36–37 of this Form 10-Q.The Firm typically experiences higher customer deposit inflows at period-ends. Therefore, the Firm believes average deposit balances are more representative of deposit trends. The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposit balance as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, as well as average deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Deposits  Three months ended March 31,  March 31, Dec. 31, Average(in millions)20132012 20132012Consumer & Community Banking$457,176$438,484 $441,335$401,580Corporate & Investment Bank390,464385,560 356,473351,144Commercial Banking192,121198,383 182,197184,689Asset Management139,679144,579 139,441127,534Corporate/Private Equity23,06726,587 24,33733,535Total Firm$1,202,507$1,193,593 $1,143,783$1,098,482A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are retail deposits (38% and 37% at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively), which are considered particularly stable as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes or market volatility. Additionally, the majority of the Firm’s institutional deposits are also considered to be stable sources of funding since they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. For further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of the results for the Firm’s business segments and the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 15–34 and 36–37, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, and average balances for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

There were no average balances of long-term securities loaned for the three months ended March 31, 2012.(d)Other securitizations includes securitizations of residential mortgages, auto loans and student loans. The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table.(e)Includes long-term structured notes which are secured.(f)For additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity see Capital Management on pages 42–47 and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity on page 93 of this Form 10-Q; Note 22 on page 300 and Note 23 on pages 300-301 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Short-term fundingA significant portion of the total commercial paper liabilities, approximately 67% as of March 31, 2013, as shown in the table above, were originated from deposits that customers choose to sweep into commercial paper liabilities as a cash management program offered by CIB and are not sourced from wholesale funding markets.The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature between one day and three months, are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt, agency debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under purchase agreements. The balance at March 31, 2013, compared with the balance at December 31, 2012, and the average balance for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased predominantly  due to higher secured financing of the Firm’s assets and higher client financing activity. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities; the Firm’s demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment and market-making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors.At March 31, 2013, the balance of total unsecured and secured other borrowed funds increased slightly, compared with the balance at December 31, 2012. The average balance for the three months ended March 31, 2013, increased slightly compared with the same period in the prior year.50Long-term funding and issuanceLong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the parent holding company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding.The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemption for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For additional information, see Note 21 on pages 297–299 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Long-term unsecured fundingThree months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Issuance   Senior notes issued in the U.S. market$13,398 $6,234Senior notes issued in non-U.S. markets1,355 2,050Total senior notes14,753 8,284Subordinated debt— —Structured notes5,045 5,965Total long-term unsecured funding – issuance$19,798 $14,249    Maturities/redemptions   Total senior notes$4,007 $4,102Trust preferred securities— —Subordinated debt2,417 1,000Structured notes4,810 6,054Total long-term unsecured funding – maturities/redemptions$11,234 $11,156During April 2013 and through May 8, 2013 the Firm issued $3.2 billion of senior notes and $2.0 billion of subordinated notes in the U.S. market and $2.1 billion of senior notes in non-U.S. markets.On May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0 billion, or 100% of the liquidation amount of trust preferred securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions set forth in the documents governing those trust preferred securities.The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans, residential mortgages, auto loans and student loans as well as through advances from the FHLBs, all of which increase funding and investor diversity.The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemption for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, see Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q.51Parent holding company and subsidiary fundingThe parent holding company acts as an important source of funding to its subsidiaries. The Firm’s liquidity management is therefore intended to ensure that liquidity at the parent holding company is maintained at levels sufficient to fund the operations of the parent holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates for an extended period of time in a stress environment where access to normal funding sources is disrupted.To effectively monitor the adequacy of liquidity and funding at the parent holding company, the Firm targets pre-funding of the parent holding company to ensure that both contractual and non-contractual obligations can be met for at least 18 months assuming no access to wholesale funding markets. However, due to conservative liquidity management actions taken by the Firm, the current pre-funding of such obligations is greater than target. For further discussion on liquidity at the parent holding company see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 127–133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.High Quality Liquid AssetsHigh Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) is the estimated amount of assets the Firm believes will qualify for inclusion in the Basel III LCR based on the Firm’s current understanding of the rules. HQLA primarily consists of cash and certain unencumbered high quality, liquid assets as defined in the rules.As of March 31, 2013, the HQLA was estimated to be approximately $413 billion, compared with $341 billion as of December 31, 2012. The HQLA may fluctuate due to normal flows from client activity.  In addition to the HQLA, the Firm has significant amounts of marketable securities such as corporate debt and equity securities available to raise liquidity, if required. Furthermore, the Firm maintains significant borrowing capacity at various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. Although available, the Firm does not view borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.Credit ratingsThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see Special-purpose entities on page 38, and Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 on pages 109–119, of this Form 10-Q.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.The credit ratings of the parent holding company and certain of the Firm’s significant operating subsidiaries as of March 31, 2013, were as follows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.Chase Bank USA, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLCMarch 31, 2013Long-term issuerShort-term issuerOutlook Long-term issuerShort-term issuerOutlook Long-term issuerShort-term issuerOutlookMoody’s Investor ServicesA2P-1Negative Aa3P-1Stable A1P-1StableStandard & Poor’sAA-1Stable A+A-1Stable A+A-1StableFitch RatingsA+F1Stable A+F1Stable A+F1Stable52On March 27, 2013, S&P revised its outlook on the ratings of the Firm from Negative to Stable and affirmed the Firm’s ratings.Downgrades of the Firm’s long-term ratings by one notch or two notches could result in a downgrade of the Firm’s short-term ratings. If this were to occur, the Firm believes its cost of funds could increase and access to certain funding markets could be reduced. The nature and magnitude of the impact of further ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors (which the Firm believes are incorporated in the its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics). The Firm believes it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand any potential decrease in funding capacity due to further ratings downgrades.JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.Rating agencies continue to evaluate various ratings factors, such as regulatory reforms, rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support, and economic uncertainty and sovereign creditworthiness, and their potential impact on ratings of financial institutions. Although the Firm closely monitors and endeavors to manage factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that its credit ratings will not be changed in the future.Cash flowsAs of March 31, 2013 and 2012, cash and due from banks was $45.5 billion and $55.4 billion, respectively. These balances decreased by $8.2 billion and $4.2 billion from December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected JPMorgan Chase’s cash flows during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.Cash flows from operating activitiesJPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities support the Firm’s capital markets and lending activities, including the origination or purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale. Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities, and market conditions. Management believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and the Firm’s ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Firm’s operating liquidity needs.For the three months ended March 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.0 billion. This resulted from a decrease in trading assets - debt and equity instruments driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB and a decline in trading assets - derivative  receivables due to the increase in interest rates and depreciation of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than net income, partially as a result of adjustments for noncash items such as deferred tax expense, depreciation and amortization, provision for credit losses, and stock-based compensation. Additionally, cash proceeds received from sales and paydowns of loans originated and purchased with an initial intent to sell was higher than the cash used to acquire such loans, and also reflected higher levels of activities over the prior-year period. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds was an increase in accounts receivables due to a rise in margin loan balances driven by client activities, primarily in CIB; the timing of merchant receivables payments related to CCB’s Card business; and a decrease in trading liabilities - derivative payables due to the increase in interest rates and depreciation of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar.For the three months ended March 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion. This resulted from a decrease in trading assets - derivative receivables, predominantly due to interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives activity, partially offset by increased equity derivative balances reflecting market levels. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds was an increase in trading assets - debt and equity instruments, driven by client market-making activity in CIB. Additionally, cash used to acquire the loans originated and purchased with an initial intent to sell was higher than the cash proceeds received from the sales and paydowns of such loans, and also reflected a lower level of activity over the prior-year period. Net cash was provided by net income after adjustments of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization, provision for credit losses, and stock-based compensation. Cash flows from investing activitiesThe Firm’s investing activities predominantly include loans originated to be held for investment, the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term interest-earning assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, net cash of $55.5 billion was used in investing activities. This resulted from a significant increase in deposits with banks reflecting the placement of the Firm’s excess funds with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve banks. Partially offsetting these cash outflows were a decline in securities purchased under resale agreements due primarily to a shift in the deployment of the Firm’s excess cash by Treasury; a decrease in loan balances as a result of lower credit card loans due to seasonality and higher repayment rates; and lower consumer excluding credit card loans, predominantly due to mortgage-related paydowns and portfolio run-off, partially offset by higher levels of wholesale loans, primarily in CIB and CB, driven by higher wholesale activity across most of the Firm’s regions and businesses; and proceeds from maturities and sales that were higher than the cash used to acquire new AFS securities.53For the three months ended March 31, 2012, net cash of $45.4 billion was used in investing activities. This resulted from a significant increase in deposits with banks reflecting the placement of funds with various central banks, including Federal Reserve banks; net purchases of AFS securities, largely due to repositioning of the portfolio in Corporate in response to changes in the market environment; and an increase in wholesale loans, due to increased client activity across most wholesale businesses and regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower consumer loans, due to seasonality and higher repayment rates on credit card loans, and paydowns and portfolio run-off of residential real estate loans.Cash flows from financing activitiesThe Firm’s financing activities predominantly include taking customer deposits, and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and common stock. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $28.2 billion. This was driven by net proceeds from long-term borrowings; an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements predominantly due to higher secured financing of the Firm’s assets and higher client financing activity; an increase in commercial paper due to higher commercial paper issuance, partially offset by a decline in the volume of liability balances related to CIB’s liquidity management product; and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. Partially offsetting these cash inflows were repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends on common and preferred stock.For the three months ended March 31, 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was $35.4 billion. This was driven by an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, predominantly because of higher financing of the Firm’s trading assets and a change in the mix of liabilities; an increase in other borrowed funds predominantly driven by an increase in borrowings due to favorable market rates. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds were a decrease in wholesale deposits from CIB clients; net redemptions and maturities of long-term borrowings; payments of cash dividends on common and preferred stock and repurchases of common stock.54CREDIT PORTFOLIOFor a further discussion of the Firm’s Credit Risk Management framework, see pages 134–135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.For further information regarding the credit risk inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio, see Note 11 on pages 123–126 of this Form 10-Q and Note 12 on pages 244–248 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The following tables present JPMorgan Chase’s credit portfolio as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. Total credit exposure was $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2013, an increase of $2.7 billion from December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting an increase in the wholesale portfolio of $6.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer portfolio of $3.5 billion. For further information on the changes in the credit portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–65, and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 66–73, of this Form 10-Q.In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale (which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue); and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The Firm also records certain loans accounted for at fair value in trading assets. For further information regarding these loans see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q.

These amounts were excluded from nonaccrual loans as reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”).(d)Excludes PCI loans. Because the Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans, they are all considered to be performing.(e)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, total nonaccrual loans represented 1.43% and 1.46%, respectively, of total loans.55CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIOJPMorgan Chase’s consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, business banking loans, and student loans. The Firm’s primary focus is on serving the prime segment of the consumer credit market. For further information on consumer loans, see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.A substantial portion of the consumer loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction were identified as PCI based on an analysis of high-risk characteristics, including product type, loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios, FICO risk scores and delinquency status. These PCI loans are accounted for on a pool basis, and the pools are considered to be performing. For further information on PCI loans see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continued to improve as the economy continued to slowly expand during the three months ended March 31, 2013, resulting in a reduction in estimated credit losses. High unemployment relative to the historical norm and lower housing prices relative to the peak of the housing market continue to negatively impact the number of residential real estate loans being charged off and the severity of loss recognized on defaulted residential real estate loans. Early-stage residential real estate delinquencies (30–89 days delinquent), excluding government guaranteed loans, decreased during the first quarter of the year and late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) continued to decline but remain elevated. The elevated level of the late-stage delinquent loans is due, in part, to loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Losses related to these loans continue to be recognized in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off practices, but some delinquent loans that would otherwise have been foreclosed upon remain in the mortgage and home equity loan portfolios. In addition to these elevated levels of delinquencies, high unemployment, uncertainties regarding the ultimate success of loan modifications, and the risk attributes of certain loans within the portfolio (e.g., loans with high LTV ratios, junior lien loans that are subordinate to a delinquent or modified senior lien, HELOCs with future payment recast) continue to contribute to uncertainty regarding overall residential real estate portfolio performance and have been considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.56The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the credit portfolio held by CCB as well as for residential real estate loans reported in the Asset Management and the Corporate/Private Equity segments for the dates indicated.

These amounts were excluded from nonaccrual loans as reimbursement of insured amounts are proceeding normally. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.(g)Excludes PCI loans. Because the Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans, they are all considered to be performing.(h)Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $822 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This amount was excluded when calculating net charge-off rates. There were no loans held-for-sale for the three months ended March 31, 2013.57Consumer, excluding credit cardPortfolio analysisConsumer loan balances declined during the three months ended March 31, 2013, due to paydowns, portfolio run-off and charge-offs, partially offset by new prime mortgage and auto loan originations. Credit performance has improved across most portfolios but residential real estate charge-offs and delinquent loans remain above normal levels.The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-related categories. PCI loans are generally excluded from individual loan product discussions and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm’s consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.Home equity: The Home equity portfolio at March 31, 2013, was $64.8 billion, compared with $67.4 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease in this portfolio primarily reflected loan paydowns and charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies showed improvement from December 31, 2012, while late stage-delinquencies were flat due, in part, to loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Net charge-offs for both senior and junior lien home equity loans declined when compared with the same period of the prior year. Senior lien nonaccrual loans increased from December 31, 2012, while junior lien nonaccrual loans decreased.Approximately 20% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consists of home equity loans (“HELOANs”) and the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3–30 years. Approximately half of the HELOANs are senior liens and the remainder are junior liens. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC recasts into a fully-amortizing variable-rate loan with a 20-year amortization period. At the time of origination, the borrower typically selects one of two minimum payment options that will generally remain in effect during the revolving period: a monthly payment of 1% of the outstanding balance, or interest-only payments based on a variable index (typically Prime). HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan’s term.Of the approximately $55 billion unpaid principal balance of non-PCI HELOCs outstanding at March 31, 2013, approximately $40 billion in HELOCs are already fully amortizing, currently possess an ability to refinance, are interest-only balloon loans, or are expected to paydown or charge-off prior to recasting. The remaining $15 billion  represents borrowers who do not currently possess the ability to refinance, and are expected to experience a recast in future periods. These recasts will primarily occur from 2015 through 2017, at which time the borrower must begin to make fully-amortizing payments. The Firm has considered this payment recast risk in its allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated amount of payment shock (i.e., the excess of the fully-amortizing payment over the interest-only payment in effect prior to recast) expected to occur at the payment recast date, along with corresponding estimated probability of default and loss severity assumptions. Certain factors, such as future developments in both unemployment and home prices, could have a significant impact on the expected and/or actual performance of these loans.The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile or when the collateral does not support the loan amount. The Firm will continue to evaluate both the near-term and longer-term repricing and recast risks inherent in its HELOC portfolio to ensure that changes in the Firm’s estimate of these incurred losses are appropriately considered in the allowance for credit losses and that the Firm’s account management practices are appropriate given the portfolio’s risk profile.At March 31, 2013, the Firm estimated that its home equity portfolio contained approximately $2.8 billion of current junior lien loans where the borrower has a first mortgage loan that is either delinquent or has been modified (“high-risk seconds”), compared with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2012. Such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than that of junior lien loans for which the senior lien is neither delinquent nor modified. The Firm estimates the balance of its total exposure to high-risk seconds on a quarterly basis using internal data, loan level credit bureau data, which typically provides the delinquency status of the senior lien, as well as information from a database maintained by one of the bank regulatory agencies. The estimated balance of these high-risk seconds may vary from quarter-to-quarter for reasons such as the movement of related senior liens in to and out of the 30+ day delinquency bucket.Current high risk junior liens     (in billions) Mar 31, 2013Dec 31, 2012Junior liens subordinate to:     Modified current senior lien  $1.0 $1.1Senior lien 30 – 89 days delinquent  0.8 0.9Senior lien 90 days or more delinquent(a)  1.0 1.1Total current high risk junior liens  $2.8 $3.1(a)Junior liens subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due are classified as nonaccrual loans. At both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, excluded approximately $100 million of junior liens that are performing but not current, which were also placed on nonaccrual in accordance with the regulatory guidance.58Of the estimated $2.8 billion of high-risk junior liens at March 31, 2013, the Firm owns approximately 5% and services approximately 30% of the related senior lien loans to the same borrowers. The performance of the Firm’s junior lien loans is generally consistent regardless of whether the Firm owns, services or does not own or service the senior lien. The increased probability of default associated with these higher-risk junior lien loans was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.Mortgage: Mortgage loans at March 31, 2013, including prime, subprime and loans held-for-sale, were $85.6 billion, compared with $84.5 billion at December 31, 2012. The mortgage portfolio increased during the quarter as prime mortgage originations outpaced paydowns, portfolio run-off and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs decreased from the same period of the prior year, as a result of improvement in delinquencies, but remained elevated.Prime mortgages, including option adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”), were $77.6 billion at March 31, 2013, compared with $76.3 billion at December 31, 2012. These loans increased as prime mortgage originations exceeded charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans, paydowns, and portfolio run-off of option ARM loans. Excluding loans insured by U.S. government agencies, both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies showed improvement during the three months ended March 31, 2013. Nonaccrual loans were flat compared with the prior quarter and remain elevated as a result of ongoing foreclosure processing delays. Net charge-offs continued to improve, as a result of improvement in delinquencies.Option ARM loans, which are included in the prime mortgage portfolio, were $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion and represented 8% and 9% of the prime mortgage portfolio at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The decrease in option ARM loans resulted from portfolio run-off. As of March 31, 2013, approximately 6% of option ARM borrowers were delinquent, 1% were making interest-only or negatively amortizing payments, and 93% were making amortizing payments (such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing). Approximately 84% of borrowers within the portfolio are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast, as only a limited number of these loans have been modified. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance due to negative amortization of option ARMs was not material at either March 31, 2013, or December 31, 2012. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM loans will undergo a payment recast that results in a payment increase: $482 million in 2013, $971 million in 2014 and $725 million in 2015. Default rates generally increase when payment recast results in a payment increase. However, as the Firm’s option ARM loans, other than those held in the PCI portfolio, are primarily loans with lower LTV ratios and higher borrower FICO scores, it is possible that many of these borrowers will be able to refinance into a  lower rate product, which would reduce this payment recast risk. Accordingly, the Firm expects substantially lower losses on this portfolio when compared with the PCI option ARM portfolio. To date, losses realized on option ARM loans that have undergone payment recast have been immaterial and consistent with the Firm’s expectations. The option ARM portfolio was acquired by the Firm as part of the Washington Mutual transaction.Subprime mortgages at March 31, 2013, were $8.0 billion, compared with $8.3 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease was due to portfolio run-off and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Early-stage and late-stage delinquencies as well as nonaccrual loans have improved from December 31, 2012, but remain at elevated levels. Net charge-offs decreased from the prior year.Auto: Auto loans at March 31, 2013, were $50.6 billion, compared with $49.9 billion at December 31, 2012. Loan balances increased due to new originations partially offset by paydowns and payoffs. Delinquent and nonaccrual loans improved compared with December 31, 2012. Net charge-offs increased from the prior year, but loss levels are considered low as a result of favorable trends in both loss frequency and loss severity, mainly due to enhanced underwriting standards and a strong used car market. The auto loan portfolio reflected a high concentration of prime-quality credits.Business banking: Business banking loans at March 31, 2013, decreased to $18.7 billion from $18.9 billion at December 31, 2012. Delinquent loans were flat while nonaccrual loans improved from December 31, 2012. Net charge-offs declined from the prior year due to favorable trends in the credit environment.Student and other: Student and other loans at March 31, 2013, were $11.9 billion, compared with $12.2 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs of student loans. Other loans primarily include other secured and unsecured consumer loans. Nonaccrual loans increased from December 31, 2012 while charge-offs decreased from the prior year.Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans at March 31, 2013, were $58.4 billion, compared with $59.7 billion at December 31, 2012. This portfolio represents loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction, which were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. PCI HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan’s term. Substantially all undrawn HELOCs within the revolving period have been closed.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, no change in impairment was recognized in connection with the Firm’s review of the PCI portfolios’ expected cash flows. At both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the allowance for loan losses for the home equity, prime mortgage, option ARM and subprime mortgage PCI portfolios was 59$1.9 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion and $380 million, respectively.As of March 31, 2013, approximately 26% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and 49% have been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. Substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing; in addition, substantially all of these loans are subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly estimates of expected cash flows for the PCI portfolio. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option ARM PCI pool was $854 million and $879 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM PCI loans will undergo a payment recast that results in a payment increase: $119 million in 2013, $522 million in 2014, and $802 million in 2015.The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in both the nonaccretable difference and the allowance for loan losses. Lifetime principal loss estimates were relatively unchanged from December 31, 2012, to March 31, 2013. Principal charge-offs will not be recorded on these pools until the nonaccretable difference has been fully depleted.Summary of lifetime principal loss estimates Lifetime loss estimates(a) LTD liquidation losses(b)(in billions)Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012 Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012Home equity$14.9 $14.9 $11.7 $11.5Prime mortgage4.1 4.2 3.0 2.9Subprime mortgage3.6 3.6 2.3 2.2Option ARMs11.3 11.3 8.1 8.0Total$33.9 $34.0 $25.1 $24.6(a)Includes the original nonaccretable difference established in purchase accounting of $30.5 billion for principal losses only plus additional principal losses recognized subsequent to acquisition through the provision and allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition of residential real estate loansAt both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, California had the greatest concentration of residential real estate loans with 24% of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans. Of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, $73.7 billion, or 55%, were concentrated in California, New York, Arizona, Florida and Michigan at March 31, 2013, compared with $74.1 billion, or 54%, at December 31, 2012. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans concentrated in these five states represented 72% of total PCI loans at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.Current estimated LTVs of residential real estate loansThe current estimated average LTV ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, was 79% at March 31, 2013, compared with 81% at December 31, 2012. Excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, 17% of the retained portfolio had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 6% of the retained portfolio had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 125% at March 31, 2013, compared with 20% and 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Although home prices have begun to slowly recover, the decline in home prices from 2007 has had a significant impact on the collateral values underlying the Firm’s residential real estate loan portfolio. In general, the delinquency rate for loans with high LTV ratios is greater than the delinquency rate for loans in which the borrower has equity in the collateral. While a large portion of the loans with current estimated LTV ratios greater than 100% continue to pay and are current, the continued willingness and ability of these borrowers to pay remains a risk.60The following table presents the current estimated LTV ratios, as well as the ratios of the carrying value of the underlying loans to the current estimated collateral value, with respect to the Firm’s PCI loans. Because such loans were initially measured at fair value, the ratios of the carrying value to the current estimated collateral value will be lower than the current estimated LTV ratios, which are based on the unpaid principal balances. The estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.LTV ratios and ratios of carrying values to current estimated collateral values – PCI loans     March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions, except ratios) Unpaid principal balanceCurrent estimated LTV ratio(a)Net carrying value(c)Ratio of netcarrying valueto current estimated collateral value(c) Unpaid principal balanceCurrent estimated LTV ratio(a)Net carrying value(c)Ratio of netcarrying valueto current estimated collateral value(c)Home equity $21,743107%(b) $18,61791% $22,343111%(b) $19,06395%Prime mortgage 13,49199 11,43784 13,884104 11,74588Subprime mortgage 6,180104 4,18170 6,326107 4,24672Option ARMs 21,96497 18,49182 22,591101 18,97285(a)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated at least quarterly based on home valuation models that utilize nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates; such models incorporate actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available.(b)Represents current estimated combined LTV for junior home equity liens, which considers all available lien positions related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(c)Net carrying value includes the effect of fair value adjustments that were applied to the consumer PCI portfolio at the date of acquisition and is also net of the allowance for loan losses of $1.9 billion for home equity, $1.9 billion for prime mortgage, $1.5 billion for option ARMs, and $380 million for subprime mortgage at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.The current estimated average LTV ratios were 105% and 120% for California and Florida PCI loans, respectively, at March 31, 2013, compared with 110% and 125%, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Average LTV ratios have declined consistent with recent improvement in home prices. Although prices have improved, home prices in California and Florida are still lower than at the peak of the housing market, which continues to negatively contribute to current estimated average LTV ratios and the ratio of net carrying value to current estimated collateral value for loans in the PCI portfolio. Of the PCI portfolio, 49% had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 20% had a current LTV ratio of greater than 125% at March 31, 2013, compared with 55% and 24%, respectively, at December 31, 2012.While the current estimated collateral value is greater than the net carrying value of PCI loans, the ultimate performance of this portfolio is highly dependent on borrowers’ behavior and ongoing ability and willingness to continue to make payments on homes with negative equity, as well as on the cost of alternative housing. For further information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of residential real estate – non-PCI and PCI loans, see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q. Loan modification activities – residential real estate loansFor both the Firm’s on–balance sheet loans and loans serviced for others, nearly 1.5 million mortgage modifications have been offered to borrowers and approximately 654,000 have been approved since the beginning of 2009. Of these, approximately 644,000 have achieved permanent modification as of March 31, 2013. Of the remaining modifications offered, 14% are in a trial period or still being reviewed for a modification, while 86% have dropped out of the modification program or otherwise were deemed not eligible for final modification.The Firm is participating in the U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable (“MHA”) programs and is continuing to offer its other loss-mitigation programs to financially distressed borrowers who do not qualify for the U.S. Treasury’s programs. The MHA programs include the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”) and the Second Lien Modification Program (“2MP”). The Firm’s other loss-mitigation programs for troubled borrowers who do not qualify for HAMP include the traditional modification programs offered by the GSEs and other governmental agencies, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, which include concessions similar to those offered under HAMP and 2MP but with expanded eligibility criteria. In addition, the Firm has offered specific targeted modification programs to higher risk borrowers, many of whom were current on their mortgages prior to modification. For further information about how loans are modified, see Note 13, Loan modifications, on pages 136–141 of this Form 10-Q.61Loan modifications under HAMP and under one of the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, which are largely modeled after HAMP, require at least three payments to be made under the new terms during a trial modification period, and must be successfully re-underwritten with income verification before the loan can be permanently modified. In the case of specific targeted modification programs, re-underwriting the loan or a trial modification period is generally not required, unless the targeted loan is delinquent at the time of modification. When the Firm modifies home equity lines of credit, future lending commitments related to the modified loans are canceled as part of the terms of the modification.The primary indicator used by management to monitor the success of the modification programs is the rate at which the modified loans redefault. Modification redefault rates are affected by a number of factors, including the type of loan modified, the borrower’s overall ability and willingness to repay the modified loan and macroeconomic factors. Reduction in payment size for a borrower continues to be the most significant driver in improving redefault rates.The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type and also on whether the underlying loan is in the PCI portfolio, due both to differences in credit quality and in the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 19% for senior lien home equity, 17% for junior lien home equity, 14% for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 24% for subprime mortgages. The cumulative performance metrics for modifications to the PCI residential real estate portfolio seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 18% for home equity, 16% for prime mortgages, 14% for option ARMs and 27% for subprime mortgages. The favorable performance of the option ARM modifications is the result of a targeted proactive program which fixes the borrower’s payment at the current level. The cumulative redefault rates reflect the performance of modifications completed under both HAMP and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs from October 1, 2009, through March 31, 2013.The following table presents information as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, relating to modified on–balance sheet residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications of PCI loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans, and the impact of the modification is incorporated into the Firm’s quarterly assessment of estimated future cash flows. Modifications of consumer loans other than PCI loans are generally accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). For further information on TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.

When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. For additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae, see Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q.(c)Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans.(d)As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, nonaccrual loans included $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.62Nonperforming assetsThe following table presents information as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.Nonperforming assets(a)   (in millions)Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012Nonaccrual loans(b)   Home equity – senior lien$943 $931Home equity – junior lien2,161 2,277Prime mortgage, including option ARMs3,479 3,445Subprime mortgage1,792 1,807Auto135 163Business banking458 481Student and other80 70Total nonaccrual loans9,048 9,174Assets acquired in loan satisfactions   Real estate owned635 647Other40 37Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions675 684Total nonperforming assets$9,723 $9,858(a)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, nonperforming assets excluded: (1) mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $10.9 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due; (2) real estate owned insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively; and (3) student loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP of $523 million and $525 million, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due. These amounts were excluded as reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally.(b)Excludes PCI loans that were acquired as part of the Washington Mutual transaction, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. Because the Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans, they are all considered to be performing.Nonaccrual loans: Total consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans were $9.0 billion at March 31, 2013, compared with $9.2 billion at December 31, 2012.Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio totaled $8.4 billion at March 31, 2013, of which 40% were greater than 150 days past due, compared with nonaccrual residential real estate loans of $8.5 billion at December 31, 2012, of which 42% were greater than 150 days past due. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 52% to estimated net realizable value of the collateral at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The elongated foreclosure processing timelines are expected to continue to result in elevated levels of nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolios.Modified loans have also contributed to the elevated level of nonaccrual loans, since the Firm’s policy requires modified loans that are on nonaccrual status to remain on nonaccrual status until payment is reasonably assured and the  borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the modified terms. At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, modified residential real estate loans of $4.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, were classified as nonaccrual loans.Real estate owned (“REO”): REO assets are managed for prompt sale and disposition at the best possible economic value. REO assets are those individual properties where the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). The Firm generally recognizes REO assets at the completion of the foreclosure process or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. REO assets, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, decreased by $12 million from $647 million at December 31, 2012, to $635 million at March 31, 2013.Mortgage servicing-related mattersThe financial crisis resulted in unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of 1-4 family residential real estate loans. Such loans required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. It is the Firm’s goal that foreclosure in these situations be a last resort, and accordingly, the Firm has made, and continues to make, significant efforts to help borrowers stay in their homes. Since the third quarter of 2010, the Firm has prevented two foreclosures for every foreclosure completed; foreclosure-prevention methods include loan modification, short sales and other means.The Firm has a well-defined foreclosure prevention process when a borrower fails to pay on his or her loan. The Firm attempts to contact the borrower multiple times and in various ways in an effort to pursue home retention or other options other than foreclosure. In addition, if the Firm is unable to contact a borrower, the Firm completes various reviews of the borrower’s facts and circumstances before a foreclosure sale is completed. The delinquency period for the average borrower at the time of foreclosure over the last year has been approximately 25 months.The high volume of delinquent and defaulted mortgages experienced by the Firm has placed a significant amount of stress on the Firm’s servicing operations. The Firm has entered into a global settlement with certain federal and state agencies and Consent Orders with its banking regulators with respect to various mortgage servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure process-related matters as further discussed below. The GSEs also impose compensatory fees on its mortgage servicers, including the Firm, if such servicers are unable to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs. The Firm has incurred, and is continuing to incur, compensatory fees, which are reported in default servicing expense. To address its underlying mortgage servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure process issues, the Firm has made significant changes to its mortgage operations, which will enable it to continue working towards complying with the Consent Orders and the global settlement and enhance its ability to 63comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs. On April 22, 2013, the OCC issued guidance regarding the obligation of servicers to track loans scheduled for foreclosure sale within 60 days and to confirm certain information prior to proceeding with the scheduled sale. The Firm is reviewing its practices in response to this guidance.Global settlement with federal and state agencies: On February 9, 2012, the Firm announced that it had agreed to a settlement in principle (the “global settlement”) with a number of federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the State Attorneys General, relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The global settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required the Firm to, among other things: (i) make cash payments of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of which will be set aside for payments to borrowers (“Cash Settlement Payment”); (ii) provide approximately $500 million of refinancing relief to certain “underwater” borrowers whose loans are owned and serviced by the Firm (“Refi Program”); and (iii) provide approximately $3.7 billion of additional relief for certain borrowers, including reductions of principal on first and second liens, payments to assist with short sales, deficiency balance waivers on past foreclosures and short sales, and forbearance assistance for unemployed homeowners (“Consumer Relief Program”). The Cash Settlement Payment was made on April 13, 2012, and all refinancings required under the Refi Program were completed as of December 31, 2012. Satisfaction of the Consumer Relief Program and the Refi Program requirements under the global settlement is subject to certification by the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight.The first and second lien loan modifications provided for in the Consumer Relief Program typically involve principal reductions for borrowers who have negative equity in their homes and who are experiencing financial difficulty. These loan modifications are primarily executed under the terms of either MHA (e.g., HAMP, 2MP) or one of the Firm’s proprietary modification programs. The Firm began to provide relief to borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program in the first quarter of 2012 and expects to substantially complete its obligations under the Consumer Relief Program in the first half of 2013. If the Firm does not meet certain targets set forth in the global settlement for providing borrower relief under the Consumer Relief Program within certain prescribed time periods, the Firm must instead make additional cash payments.As the Firm continues to provide relief to borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program, the Firm receives credits that reduce its remaining obligation under this program. The Firm expects to file its next quarterly report concerning its compliance with the global settlement with the Office of  Mortgage Settlement Oversight in May of 2013. The report will include information regarding relief provided to borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program, as well as credits asserted by the Firm under the global settlement.The global settlement also requires the Firm to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards. The servicing standards include, among other items, the following enhancements to the Firm’s servicing of loans: a pre-foreclosure notice to all borrowers, which will include account information, holder status, and loss mitigation steps taken; enhancements to payment application and collections processes; strengthening procedures for filings in bankruptcy proceedings; deploying specific restrictions on the “dual track” of foreclosure and loss mitigation; standardizing the process for appeal of loss mitigation denials; and implementing certain restrictions on fees, including the waiver of certain fees while a borrower’s loss mitigation application is being evaluated. The Firm believes it has implemented substantially all of the prescribed servicing standards’ recommendations within the required timeframes and these recommendations are being reviewed by the regulators.Consent Orders: During the second quarter of 2011, the Firm entered into Consent Orders (“Orders”) with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. In the Orders, the regulators have mandated significant changes to the Firm’s servicing and default business and outlined requirements to implement these changes. The Firm submitted comprehensive action plans to the regulators, which set forth the steps necessary to ensure the Firm’s residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Orders. The plans were approved and the Firm has implemented a number of corrective actions and made significant progress with respect to the following:•Established an independent Compliance Committee which meets regularly and monitors progress against the Orders.•Launched a new Customer Assistance Specialist organization for borrowers to facilitate the single point of contact initiative and ensure effective coordination and communication related to foreclosure, loss-mitigation and loan modification.•Enhanced its approach to oversight over third-party vendors for foreclosure or other related functions.•Standardized the processes for maintaining appropriate controls and oversight of the Firm’s activities with respect to the Mortgage Electronic Registration system (“MERS”) and compliance with MERSCORP’s membership rules, terms and conditions.•Strengthened its compliance program so as to ensure mortgage-servicing and foreclosure operations, including loss-mitigation and loan modification, comply with all applicable legal requirements.64•Enhanced management information systems for loan modification, loss-mitigation and foreclosure activities.•Developed a comprehensive assessment of risks in servicing operations including, but not limited to, operational, transaction, legal and reputational risks.•Made technological enhancements to automate and streamline processes for the Firm’s document management, training, skills assessment and payment processing initiatives.•Deployed an internal validation process to monitor progress under the comprehensive action plans.In addition, pursuant to the Orders, the Firm is required to enhance oversight of its mortgage servicing activities, including oversight by compliance, management and audit personnel and, accordingly, has made and continues to make changes in its organization structure, control oversight and customer service practices.Pursuant to the Orders, the Firm had retained an independent consultant to conduct a review of its residential foreclosure actions during the period from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010 (including foreclosure actions brought in respect of loans being serviced), and to remediate any errors or deficiencies identified by the independent consultant. On January 7, 2013, the Firm announced that it and a number of other financial institutions had entered into a settlement agreement with the OCC and the Federal Reserve providing for the termination of such Independent Foreclosure Review programs. On February 28, 2013, the Firm entered into an Amended Consent Order with the regulators reflecting the settlement of the Independent Foreclosure Review. As a result of this settlement, the independent consultant is no longer conducting a look-back review of residential foreclosure actions. The Firm has made total cash payments of approximately $750 million into a settlement fund for distribution to qualified borrowers. The Firm has also committed an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure prevention actions, which will be fulfilled through credits given to the Firm for modifications, short sales and other specified types of borrower relief. Foreclosure prevention actions that earn credit under the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement are in addition to actions taken by the Firm to earn credit under the Consumer Relief Program of the global settlement. The estimated impact of the foreclosure prevention actions required under the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement has been considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. The Firm recognized a pretax charge of approximately $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. For additional information on Mortgage servicing-related matters, see pages 146–148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. Credit CardTotal credit card loans were $121.9 billion at March 31, 2013, a decrease of $6.1 billion from December 31, 2012, due to seasonality and higher repayment rates.For the retained credit card portfolio, the 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 1.94% at March 31, 2013, from 2.10% at December 31, 2012. For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the net charge-off rates were 3.55% and 4.40%, respectively. Charge-offs have improved compared to a year ago as a result of continued improvement in delinquent loans. The credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned, largely rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S. geographic diversification. The greatest geographic concentration of credit card retained loans is in California, which represented 13% of total retained loans at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. Loan concentration for the top five states of California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois consisted of $50.1 billion in receivables, or 41% of the retained loan portfolio, at March 31, 2013, compared with $52.3 billion, or 41%, at December 31, 2012.Modifications of credit card loansAt March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. The decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from December 31, 2012, was attributable to a reduction in new modifications as well as ongoing payments and charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans.Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged-off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income.For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–65 and Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.65WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIOAs of March 31, 2013, wholesale exposure (CIB, CB, and AM) continues to experience a favorable credit environment and stable credit trends with low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Wholesale exposure increased by $6.2 billion from December 31, 2012, primarily driven by increases of $6.3 billion in receivables from customers and $3.8 billion in loans. These increases were partially offset by a $4.4 billion decrease in derivative receivables. The decrease in derivative receivables was primarily due to the increase in interest rates and depreciation of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. These changes resulted in reductions to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by increased equity and credit derivative receivables.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist  of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, decreased by 6% to $14.7 billion at March 31, 2013, from $15.6 billion at December 31, 2012, primarily due to repayments and sales.67Below are summaries of the top 25 industry exposures as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.

Wholesale nonaccrual loans represented 0.43% and 0.49% of total wholesale loans at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.70LoansIn the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators, see Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.The Firm actively manages wholesale credit exposure. One way of managing credit risk is through sales of loans and lending-related commitments. During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Firm sold $2.7 billion and $957 million, respectively, of loans and commitments. These sale activities are not related to the Firm’s securitization activities. For further discussion of securitization activity, see Liquidity Risk Management and Note 15 on pages 49–54 and 151–158, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Nonaccrual wholesale loans decreased by $168 million from December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting paydowns.Wholesale nonaccrual loan activity  Three months ended March 31,   (in millions) 20132012Beginning balance $1,545$2,581Additions 455422Reductions:  Paydowns and other 331416Gross charge-offs 6692Returned to performing status 7259Sales 154281Total reductions 623848Net reductions (168)(426)Ending balance $1,377$2,155The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.

In the event that the collateral value decreases, a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account. If additional collateral is not provided by the client, the client’s position may be liquidated by the Firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements.Lending-related commitmentsJPMorgan Chase uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of these contracts.In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s actual credit risk exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments, the Firm has established a “loan-equivalent” amount for each commitment; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor. The loan-equivalent amount of the Firm’s lending-related commitments was $216.8 billion and $223.7 billion as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.71Derivative contractsIn the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. Derivatives enable customers and the Firm to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit exposure. For further discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.Derivative receivables  (in millions)Derivative receivablesMar 31, 2013Dec 31, 2012Interest rate$34,280$39,205Credit derivatives3,6641,735Foreign exchange12,34614,142Equity10,0359,266Commodity10,28410,635Total, net of cash collateral70,60974,983Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(13,837)(15,201)Total, net of collateral$56,772$59,782Derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $70.6 billion and $75.0 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. These amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting  agreements, cash collateral held by the Firm and the CVA. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $13.8 billion and $15.2 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor.In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash; G7 government securities; other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities; and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Though this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative transactions move in the Firm’s favor. As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm held $31.1 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively, of this additional collateral. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements, see Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes the ratings profile, by derivative counterparty, of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of other liquid securities collateral, for the dates indicated.Ratings profile of derivative receivables      Rating equivalentMarch 31, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions, except ratios)Exposure net of all collateral% of exposure net of all collateral Exposure net of all collateral% of exposure net of all collateralAAA/Aaa to AA-/Aa3$21,19737% $19,96434%A+/A1 to A-/A310,18218 12,03920BBB+/Baa1 to BBB-/Baa316,64629 18,06630BB+/Ba1 to B-/B37,37113 8,43414CCC+/Caa1 and below1,3763 1,2792Total$56,772100% $59,782100%As noted above, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements – excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity – was 87% as of March 31, 2013, largely unchanged compared with 88% as of December 31, 2012. Credit derivativesCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller) when the reference entity suffers a credit event. If no credit event has occurred, the protection seller makes no payments to the protection purchaser.72For a more detailed description of credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 on pages 118–119 of this Form 10-Q; and on pages 158–159 and Note 6 on pages 218–227 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker; and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures.Included in end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (“Credit Portfolio Management” activities). Information on Credit Portfolio Management activities is provided in the table below. For further information on derivatives used in Credit Portfolio Management activities, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 on pages 118–119 of this Form 10-Q, and on pages 158–159 and Note 6 on pages 218–227 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.In addition, the Firm uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain AFS securities and from certain securities held in the Firm’s market making businesses. These credit derivatives, as well as the synthetic credit portfolio, are not included in Credit Portfolio Management activities; for further information on these credit derivatives as well as credit derivatives used in the Firm’s capacity as a market maker in credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 on pages 118–119 of this Form 10-Q.Credit Portfolio Management activitiesCredit Portfolio Management derivatives Notional amount of protection purchased and sold (a)(in millions)Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012Credit derivatives used to manage:   Loans and lending-related commitments$2,757 $2,166Derivative receivables22,277 25,347Total net protection purchased25,034 27,513Total net protection sold66 66Credit Portfolio Management derivatives notional, net$24,968 $27,447(a)Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index. The credit derivatives used in Credit Portfolio Management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure. In addition, the effectiveness of the Firm’s credit default swap (“CDS”) protection as a hedge of the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS), the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm), and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the firm.The fair value related to the Firm’s credit derivatives used for managing credit exposure, as well as the fair value related to the CVA (which reflects the credit quality of derivatives counterparty exposure), are included in the gains and losses realized on credit derivatives disclosed in the table below. These results can vary from period to period due to market conditions that affect specific positions in the portfolio.Net gains and losses on credit portfolio hedges  Three monthsendedMarch 31,(in millions) 20132012Hedges of loans and lending-related commitments $(32)$(75)CVA and hedges of CVA (37)176Net gains/(losses) $(69)$10173COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT EXPOSUREThe Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. The Firm is a national leader in community development by providing loans, investments and community development services in communities across the United States. At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm’s CRA loan portfolio was approximately $15 billion and $16 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, 61% and 62%, respectively, of the CRA portfolio were residential mortgage loans; 19% and 18%, respectively, were business banking loans; 13%, for both periods, were commercial real estate loans; and 7%, for both periods, were other loans. CRA nonaccrual loans were 4%, for both periods, of the Firm’s total nonaccrual loans. As a percentage of the Firm’s net charge-offs, net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were 2% and 3% respectively, for both the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESJPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses covers the consumer, including credit card, portfolio segments (primarily scored); and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio. The allowance represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s loan portfolio. Management also determines an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer, excluding credit card, lending-related commitments.For a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses, including adjustments to statistical loss calculations, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 85–87 of this Form 10-Q and Note 15 on pages 276–279 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Controller of the Firm, and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of March 31, 2013, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio).The allowance for credit losses was $21.5 billion at March 31, 2013, a decrease of $1.1 billion from $22.6 billion at December 31, 2012. The allowance for loan losses decreased, predominantly related to a $1.2 billion reduction due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, and also the impact of improved home prices in the residential real estate portfolio.The consumer, excluding credit card, allowance for loan losses decreased $647 million from December 31, 2012, due to a reduction in the allowance for the non-PCI residential real estate portfolio. This decrease was due to  lower estimated losses in the statistical loss calculation of the formula-based allowance, reflecting improved delinquency trends, primarily in the home equity portfolio, including the impact of improved home prices. For additional information about delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–65 and Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.The credit card allowance for loan losses decreased by $503 million from December 31, 2012. The decrease included reductions in both the asset-specific and formula-based allowance. The reduction in the asset-specific allowance, which relates to loans restructured in TDRs, largely reflects the changing profile of the TDR portfolio. The volume of new TDRs, which have higher loss rates due to expected redefaults, continues to decrease, and the loss rate on existing TDRs is also decreasing over time as previously restructured loans season and continue to perform. The reduction in the formula-based allowance was primarily driven by the continuing trend of improving delinquencies and bankruptcies, which resulted in a lower level of estimated losses based on the Firm’s statistical loss calculation, and by lower levels of credit card outstandings. For additional information about delinquencies in the credit card loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–65 and Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q.The wholesale allowance was relatively unchanged.The allowance for lending-related commitments for both the consumer, excluding credit card, and wholesale portfolios, which is reported in other liabilities, was $716 million and $668 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.74The credit ratios in the following table are based on retained loan balances, which exclude loans held-for-sale and loans accounted for at fair value.Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses      2013 2012Three months ended March 31,Consumer, excluding credit card Credit cardWholesaleTotal Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotal(in millions, except ratios) Allowance for loan losses          Beginning balance at January 1,$12,292 $5,501$4,143$21,936 $16,294$6,999$4,316$27,609Gross charge-offs720 1,248662,034 1,1341,627922,853Gross recoveries(112) (166)(31)(309) (138)(241)(87)(466)Net charge-offs/(recoveries)608 1,082351,725 9961,38652,387Provision for loan losses(37) 58224569 26368646Other(2) (3)5— (3)243Ending balance at March 31,$11,645 $4,998$4,137$20,780 $15,297$6,251$4,323$25,871Impairment methodology          Asset-specific(a)$771 $1,434$228$2,433 $760$2,402$448$3,610Formula-based5,163 3,5643,90912,636 8,8263,8493,87516,550PCI5,711 ——5,711 5,711——5,711Total allowance for loan losses$11,645 $4,998$4,137$20,780 $15,297$6,251$4,323$25,871Allowance for lending-related commitments          Beginning balance at January 1,$7 $—$661$668 $7$—$666$673Provision for lending-related commitments— —4848 (1)—8180Other— ——— 1—(4)(3)Ending balance at March 31,$7 $—$709$716 $7$—$743$750Impairment methodology          Asset-specific$— $—$82$82 $—$—$187$187Formula-based7 —627634 7—556563Total allowance for lending-related commitments$7 $—$709$716 $7$—$743$750Total allowance for credit losses$11,652 $4,998$4,846$21,496 $15,304$6,251$5,066$26,621Memo:          Retained loans, end of period$290,082 $121,865$310,582$722,529 $304,770$124,475$283,653$712,898Retained loans, average291,588 123,564303,919719,071 306,657126,795276,764710,216PCI loans, end of period58,437 —958,446 64,061—2264,083Credit ratios          Allowance for loan losses to retained loans4.01% 4.10%1.33%2.88% 5.02%5.02%1.52%3.63%Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(b)129 NM332202 181NM223249Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card129 NM332153 181NM223189Net charge-off/(recovery) rates(c)0.85 3.550.050.97 1.314.400.011.35Credit ratios, excluding residential real estate PCI loans          Allowance for loan losses to retained loans(d)2.56 4.101.332.27 3.985.021.523.11Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(b)66 NM332146 113NM223194Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card(b)66 NM33298 113NM223134Net charge-off/(recovery) rates1.06% 3.55%0.05%1.06% 1.66%4.40%0.01%1.49%(a)Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR.(b)The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.(c)Charge-offs are not recorded on PCI loans until actual losses exceed estimated losses recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition.75Provision for credit lossesFor the three months ended March 31, 2013, the provision for credit losses was $617 million, down 15% from the prior year period, and included a $1.2 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, and also the impact of improved home prices in the residential real estate portfolio.For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the total consumer provision was $545 million and $637 million, respectively. The credit card provision for credit losses was $582 million, compared with $636 million, in the prior-year period; the provision decrease from the prior year period reflected lower net charge-offs in the current  period partially offset by a smaller current year reduction in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior year. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, the consumer, excluding credit card, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $37 million, compared with an expense of $1 million for the prior year period. The current period provision reflects lower net charge-offs partially offset by a smaller reduction in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior year.For the three months ended March 31, 2013, the wholesale provision for credit losses was $72 million, compared with $89 million in the prior-year period. The current period wholesale provision reflected stable credit trends.

For a discussion of the Firm’s market risk management organization, major market risk drivers and classification of risks, see Market Risk Management on pages 163–169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. For a discussion of the Firm’s risk monitoring and control and market risk limits, see Limits on page 169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Value-at-riskJPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a  normal market environment consistent with the day-to-day risk decisions made by the lines of business. VaR is not used to estimate the impact of stressed market conditions or to manage any impact from potential stress events. The Firm uses economic-value stress testing and other techniques to capture and manage market risk arising under stressed scenarios, as described further below.For further information on the Firm’s VaR framework, see Market Risk Management on pages 163–169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The table below shows the results of the Firm’s VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.Total VaRThree months ended March 31,     2013 2012 At March 31,(in millions) Avg.MinMax  Avg.MinMax 2013 2012 CIB trading VaR by risk type                  Fixed income$55 $45 $62  $60 $47 $73  $49 $69 Foreign exchange7 6 10  11 8 22  7 14 Equities13 9 16  17 12 25  12 17 Commodities and other15 12 18  21 16 27  14 16 Diversification benefit to CIB trading VaR(34)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (46)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (31)(a) (62)(a) CIB trading VaR56 43 66  63 50 79  51 54 Credit portfolio VaR15 14 18  32 26 42  15 30 Diversification benefit to CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR(9)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (14)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (12)(a) (13)(a) Total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR62(d) 47 74  81 70 99  54(d) 71 Other VaR                  Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing VaR19 14 24  11 8 16  14 11 Chief Investment Office (“CIO”) VaR11 7 14  129(c) 85 187  7 186 Diversification benefit to total other VaR(9)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (4)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (6)(a) (6)(a) Total other VaR21 15 28  136 89 197  15 191 Diversification benefit to total CIB and other VaR(10)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (47)(a) NM(b) NM(b)  (8)(a) (61)(a) Total VaR$73 $59 $87  $170 $111 $232  $61 $201 (a)Average portfolio VaR and period-end portfolio VaR were less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification.

The CIO VaR amount has not been recalculated for the first quarter of 2012 to reflect the restatement.(d)Effective in the fourth quarter of 2012, CIB’s VaR includes the VaR of former reportable business segments, Investment Bank and Treasury & Securities Services (“TSS”), which were combined to form the CIB business segment as a result of the reorganization of the Firm’s business segments. TSS VaR was not material and was previously classified within Other VaR. Prior period VaR disclosures were not revised as a result of the business segment reorganization.VaR measurementCIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR. Reasons include the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. While the overall impact to VaR is not material, the Firm uses alternative methods to capture and measure those risk parameters not otherwise captured in  VaR, including economic-value stress testing, nonstatistical measures and risk identification for large exposures as described further below.Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. Credit portfolio VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.Other VaR includes certain positions employed as part of the Firm’s risk management function within the CIO and in the Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing businesses. CIO VaR includes positions, primarily in 77securities and derivatives, which are measured at fair value through earnings. Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing VaR includes the Firm’s mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs and all related hedges.As noted above, CIB, Credit portfolio and other VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value; however, it does include hedges of those positions, which are reported at fair value. It also does not include DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities to reflect the credit quality of the Firm; principal investments; and longer-term securities investments managed by CIO that are classified as available for sale. These positions are primarily managed through the Firm’s nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk and other cash flow-monitoring processes, rather than by using a VaR measure. Principal investing activities (including mezzanine financing, tax oriented investments, etc.) and private equity positions are managed using stress and scenario analyses and are not included in VaR. See the DVA sensitivity table on page 79 of this Form 10-Q for further details. For a discussion of Corporate/Private Equity, see pages 33–34 of this Form 10-Q.The Firm’s VaR model calculations are continuously evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and other factors. Such changes will also affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Model changes go through a review and approval process by the Model Review Group prior to implementation into the operating environment. For further information, see Model risk on pages 125–126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.First-quarter 2013 VaR resultsAs presented in the table above, average Total VaR was $73 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared with $170 million for the comparable 2012 period. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced risk in the synthetic credit portfolio and lower market volatility.Average total CIB trading and Credit portfolio VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $62 million compared with $81 million for the comparable 2012 period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower market volatility across multiple asset classes.During the third quarter of 2012, the Firm applied a new VaR model to calculate VaR for the synthetic credit portfolio that had been transferred to the CIB on July 2, 2012. (For further information, see Market Risk Management on page 166 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.) In the first quarter of 2013, in order to achieve consistency among like products within CIB and in conjunction with the implementation of Basel 2.5 requirements, the Firm moved the synthetic credit portfolio to an existing VaR model within the CIB. This change had an insignificant impact to the average fixed income VaR and average total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR, and it had no impact to the average total VaR compared with the model used in the  third and fourth quarters of 2012. When compared with the model used prior to the model change in the third quarter of 2012, this VaR model resulted in a reduction to average fixed income VaR of $11 million, average total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR of $10 million, and average total VaR of $8 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2013.Average CIO VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $11 million compared with $129 million for the comparable 2012 period, predominantly reflecting the reduction in and transfer of risk from the synthetic credit portfolio to the CIB on July 2, 2012. CIO’s retained portfolio was effectively closed out during the three months ended September 30, 2012.Average Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing VaR was $19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared with $11 million for the comparable 2012 period. The increase was driven by a reduction in diversification benefit across these businesses.The Firm’s average Total VaR diversification benefit was $10 million or 12% of the sum for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared with $47 million or 22% of the sum for the comparable 2012 period. In general, over the course of the year, VaR exposure can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change.VaR back-testingThe Firm conducts daily back-testing of VaR against its market risk-related revenue.Because VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential losses. For example, differences between current and historical market price volatility may result in fewer or greater VaR exceptions than the number indicated by the historical simulation. The VaR measurement also does not provide an estimate of the extent to which losses may occur from stress events not reflected in the historical look-back period. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. As VaR cannot be used to determine future losses in the Firm’s market risk positions, the Firm considers other metrics in addition to VaR to monitor and manage its market risk positions.The following histogram illustrates the daily market risk-related gains and losses for positions included in the Firm’s VaR calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This market risk-related revenue is defined as the change in value of: principal transactions revenue for CIB and CIO; trading related net interest income for CIB, CIO and Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing in CCB; CIB brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue; revenue from syndicated lending facilities that the 78Firm intends to distribute; and mortgage fees and related income for the Firm’s mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs, and all related hedges. Daily firmwide market risk-related revenue excludes gains and losses from DVA. The chart shows that for three months ended March 31, 2013, the Firm posted market risk related gains on each of the 63 days in this period with one day exceeding $200 million; there were no loss days in the three months ended March 31, 2013.Other risk measuresDebit valuation adjustment sensitivityThe following table provides information about the gross sensitivity of DVA to a one-basis-point increase in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads. This sensitivity represents the impact from a one-basis-point parallel shift in JPMorgan Chase’s entire credit curve. However, the sensitivity at a single point in time multiplied by the change in credit spread at a single maturity point may not be representative of the actual DVA gain or loss realized within a period. The actual results reflect the movement in credit spreads across various maturities, which typically do not move in a parallel fashion, and is the product of a constantly changing exposure profile, among other factors.Debit valuation adjustment sensitivity   (in millions)One basis-point increase in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreadMarch 31, 2013   $35   December 31, 2012   34    Economic-value stress testingAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool in measuring and controlling risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior as an indicator of losses, stress testing is intended to capture the Firm’s exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. The Firm runs weekly stress tests on market-related risks across the lines of business using multiple scenarios that assume significant changes in risk factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates or commodity prices. The framework uses a grid-based approach, which calculates multiple magnitudes of stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs for each risk factor. Stress-test results, trends and explanations based on current market risk positions are reported to the Firm’s senior management and to the lines of business to allow them to better understand the sensitivity of positions to certain defined events and manage their risks with more transparency.79Stress scenarios are defined and reviewed by Market Risk, and significant changes are reviewed by the relevant Risk Committees, (For further details see Risk Governance, on pages 123–125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report). While most of these scenarios estimate losses based on significant market moves, such as an equity market collapse or credit crisis, the Firm also develops scenarios to quantify risk coming from specific portfolios or concentrations of risks, which attempt to capture certain idiosyncratic market movements. Scenarios may be redefined on an ongoing basis to reflect current market conditions. Ad hoc scenarios are run in response to specific market events or concerns. Furthermore, the Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results under scenarios mandated by the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and ICAAP (“Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process”) processes.Nonstatistical risk measuresNonstatistical risk measures include sensitivities to variables used to value positions, such as credit spread sensitivities, interest rate basis point values and market values. These measures provide granular information on the Firm’s market risk exposure. They are aggregated by line-of-business and by risk type, and are used for tactical control and monitoring limits.Loss advisories and profit and loss drawdownsLoss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns are tools used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. Profit and loss drawdowns are defined as the decline in net profit and loss since the year-to-date peak revenue level.Risk identification for large exposuresIndividuals who manage risk positions consider potential material losses that could arise from specific, unusual events, such as a potential change in tax legislation, or a particular combination of unusual market moves. This information allows the Firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not adequately covered by standard risk measures.Nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk (i.e., “earnings-at-risk”)Interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt (e.g., accrual loans within CIB.) ALCO establishes the Firm’s interest rate risk policies and sets risk guidelines applied to nontrading positions. Treasury, working in partnership with the lines of business, calculates the Firm’s nontrading interest rate risk profile weekly and reviews it with senior management. For further discussion on interest rate exposure, see Nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk (i.e., “earnings-at-risk”) on pages 168–169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. The Firm conducts simulations of changes in nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk tests estimate the potential change in this revenue, and the corresponding impact to the Firm’s pretax net interest income, over the following 12 months, utilizing multiple assumptions as described below. These tests highlight exposures to various interest rate-sensitive factors, such as the rates themselves (e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The tests include forecasted balance sheet changes, such as asset sales and securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on current interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience and forward market expectations. The amount and pricing assumptions of deposits that have no stated maturity are based on historical performance, the competitive environment, customer behavior, and product mix.Immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk, and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed. These scenarios include the implied forward curve, nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates. These scenarios are intended to provide a comprehensive view of JPMorgan Chase’s earnings-at-risk over a wide range of outcomes.JPMorgan Chase’s 12-month pretax net interest income sensitivity profiles.(Excludes the impact of trading activities and MSRs) Immediate change in rates (in millions)+200bps+100bps-100bps-200bpsMarch 31, 2013$3,702 $2,033 NM(a) NM(a) December 31, 20123,886 2,145 NM(a) NM(a) (a)Downward 100- and 200-basis-points parallel shocks result in a federal funds target rate of zero and negative three- and six-month treasury rates. The earnings-at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful.The change in earnings-at-risk from December 31, 2012, resulted from investment portfolio repositioning, partially offset by higher expected deposit balances. The Firm’s risk to rising rates was largely the result of widening deposit margins, which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates, and ALM investment portfolio positioning.Additionally, another interest rate scenario used by the Firm — involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels — results in a 12-month pretax net interest income benefit of $901 million. The increase in net interest income under this scenario is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.80COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of the Firm’s Country Risk Management organization, and country risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control, see pages 170–173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm is exposed to country risk through its wholesale lending, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, country exposure is reported based on the country where the majority of the assets of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor are located or where the majority of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (legal residence) of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor. Country exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm’s risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain tranched credit derivatives. Different measurement approaches or assumptions would affect the amount of reported country exposure.The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under FFIEC bank regulatory requirements. There are significant reporting differences in reporting methodology, including with respect to the treatment of collateral received and the benefit of credit derivative protection. For further information on the FFIEC’s reporting methodology, see Cross-border outstandings on page 347 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Form 10-K.The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.). The selection of countries is based solely on the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent its view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions.

The Firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and, therefore, the Firm’s aggregate net exposures and sector distribution may vary over time. In addition, the net exposures may be affected by changes in market conditions, including the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations.81The following table presents the Firm’s direct exposure at March 31, 2013 to Spain, Italy, Ireland Portugal and Greece, as measured under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach. For individual exposures, corporate clients represent approximately 80% of the Firm’s non-sovereign exposure in these five countries, and substantially all of the remaining 20% of the non-sovereign exposure is to the banking sector.March 31, 2013Lending net of Allowance(a)AFS securities(b)Trading(c)Derivative collateral(d)Portfolio hedging(e)Total exposure(in billions)Spain      Sovereign$—$0.4$(1.0)$—$(0.1)$(0.7)Non-sovereign3.2—4.3(3.2)(0.2)4.1Total Spain exposure$3.2$0.4$3.3$(3.2)$(0.3)$3.4       Italy      Sovereign$—$—$9.4$(1.2)$(4.6)$3.6Non-sovereign3.4—1.8(1.4)(0.3)3.5Total Italy exposure$3.4$—$11.2$(2.6)$(4.9)$7.1       Ireland      Sovereign$—$—$—$—$(0.3)$(0.3)Non-sovereign0.4—1.9(0.2)—2.1Total Ireland exposure$0.4$—$1.9$(0.2)$(0.3)$1.8       Portugal      Sovereign$—$—$0.3$—$(0.4)$(0.1)Non-sovereign0.6——(0.4)(0.1)0.1Total Portugal exposure$0.6$—$0.3$(0.4)$(0.5)$—       Greece      Sovereign$—$—$0.1$—$—$0.1Non-sovereign——0.7(0.8)—(0.1)Total Greece exposure$—$—$0.8$(0.8)$—$—       Total exposure$7.6$0.4$17.5$(7.2)$(6.0)$12.3(a)Lending includes loans and accrued interest receivable, deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit net of participations, and undrawn commitments to extend credit.

Changes in the Firm’s methodology or assumptions would produce different results.The credit derivatives reflected in the “Trading” column include those from the Firm’s market-making activities as well as $(4.0) billion of net purchased protection in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by CIB beginning in July 2012. Based on scheduled maturities and other actions being taken in the synthetic credit portfolio, the amount of protection provided by the synthetic credit portfolio relative to the five named countries is likely to be substantially reduced during the second quarter of 2013.The credit derivatives reflected in the “Portfolio hedging” column are predominantly single-name CDS used in the Firm’s Credit Portfolio Management activities, which are intended to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities and derivative counterparty exposure. The effectiveness of the Firm’s CDS protection as a hedge of the firm’s exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection, the named reference entity, and the contractual terms of the CDS. For further information about credit derivatives see Credit derivatives on pages 158–159, and Note 6 on pages 218–227 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. The Firm’s net presentation of purchased and sold credit derivatives reflects the manner in which this exposure is managed, and reflects, in the Firm’s view, the substantial mitigation of market and counterparty credit risk in its credit derivative activities. Market risk is substantially mitigated because market-making activities, and to a lesser extent, hedging activities, often result in selling and purchasing protection related to the same underlying reference entity. For example, for each of the five named countries, as of March 31, 2013, the protection sold by the Firm was more than 93% offset by protection purchased on the identical reference entity.In addition, counterparty credit risk has been substantially mitigated by the master netting and collateral agreements in place for these credit derivatives. As of March 31, 2013, 99% of the purchased protection presented in the table above is purchased under contracts that require posting of cash collateral; 92% is purchased from investment-grade counterparties domiciled outside of the selected European countries; and 70% of the protection purchased offsets protection sold on the identical reference entity, with the identical counterparty subject to a master netting agreement.83PRINCIPAL RISK MANAGEMENTPrincipal investments are predominantly privately-held assets and instruments typically representing an ownership or junior capital position, that have unique risks due to their illiquidity and junior capital status, as well as lack of observable valuation data. Such investing activities, including mezzanine financing, tax-oriented investments and private equity positions, are typically intended to be held over extended investment periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term gain with respect to these investments. All investments are approved by investment committees that include executives who are not part of the investing businesses. An independent valuation function is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying values of principal investments, including private equity, in accordance with relevant accounting, valuation and risk policies. The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm’s general risk governance structure. Targeted levels for total and annual investments are established in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. Industry and geographic concentration limits are in place and intended to ensure diversification of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves.The Firm’s merchant banking business is managed in Corporate/Private Equity (for detailed information, see Private Equity portfolio on page 34 of this Form 10-Q); other lines of business may also conduct some principal investing activities, including investing in private equity positions, which are captured within their respective financial results.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Operational Risk Management, see pages 175–176 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.CybersecurityThe Firm devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.  The Firm and several other U.S. financial institutions continue to experience significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which are intended to disrupt consumer online banking services. The Firm has also experienced other attempts to breach the security of its systems and data. These cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of the Firm’s operations or material harm to the Firm’s customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on the Firm’s results of operations.LEGAL, FIDUCIARY AND REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of the Firm’s Legal, Fiduciary and Reputation Risk Management, see page 177 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.

DividendsAt March 31, 2013, JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, $23.5 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators.84CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRMJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant valuation judgments.Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. For further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 159–162 and Note 15 on pages 276–279 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report; for amounts recorded as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 74–76 and Note 14 on page 150 of this Form 10-Q.As noted in the discussion on pages 178–180 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions could affect the Firm’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. For example, deterioration in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled loss estimates as of March 31, 2013, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses:•For PCI loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 1% increase in unemployment from current levels could imply an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1 billion. •For the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 1% increase in unemployment from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual loss estimates of approximately $200 million.•A 50 basis point deterioration in forecasted credit card loss rates could imply an increase to modeled annualized credit card loan loss estimates of approximately $600 million.•A one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled loss estimates of approximately $2.3 billion.The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors.In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then current circumstances and conditions.It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions would affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows in evaluating the risk factors related to its loans, including risk ratings, home price assumptions, and credit card loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit loss is appropriate.85Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventoryJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.Assets measured at fair valueThe following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of thisForm 10-Q.March 31, 2013(in billions, except ratio data)Total assets at fair valueTotal level 3 assetsTrading debt and equity instruments$360.4 $22.7 Derivative receivables70.6 21.9 Trading assets431.0 44.6 AFS securities365.7 2.0(a) Loans2.2 2.1 MSRs7.9 7.9 Private equity investments7.4 6.8 Other39.8 4.0 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis854.0 67.4 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis1.0 0.8 Total assets measured at fair value $855.0 $68.2 Total Firm assets$2,389.3   Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets  2.9%(a) Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value  8.0%(a) (a)Reflects $27.3 billion of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) transferred from level 3 to level 2 during the three months ended March 31, 2013. For further discussion of the transfers, see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q.ValuationFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value, for further details see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally based on models that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs — including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Finally, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s credit-worthiness, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q.86Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, see Goodwill impairment on page 181 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuation of its mortgage lending business in CCB, which continues to have an elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The assumptions used in the valuation of this business include: (a) estimates of future cash flows for the business (which are dependent on outstanding loan balances, net interest margin, operating expense, credit losses and the amount of capital necessary given the risk of business activities to meet regulatory capital requirements), and (b) the cost of equity used to discount those cash flows to a present value. Each of these factors requires significant judgment and the assumptions used are based on management’s current best estimate and most current projections, including the anticipated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, derived from the Firm’s business forecasting process reviewed with senior management. These projections are consistent with the short-term assumptions discussed in the Business outlook on pages 8–9 of this Form 10-Q, and, in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term growth and returns of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.As of March 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of the Firm’s mortgage lending business within CCB did not exceed its carrying value; however, the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to the mortgage lending business exceeded its carrying value. For its other businesses, the Firm reviewed current conditions (including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes and current estimated market cost of equity) and prior projections of business performance. Based upon the updated valuation of its mortgage lending business and reviews of its other businesses, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to all of its reporting units was not impaired at March 31, 2013.Deterioration in economic market conditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, or additional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected business performance beyond management’s current expectations. For example, in the Firm’s mortgage lending business, such declines could result from increases in costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters or from deterioration in economic conditions that result in increased credit losses or lower mortgage origination volume. In addition, the earnings or estimated cost of equity of the Firm’s capital markets businesses could also be affected by regulatory or  legislative changes. Declines in business performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.For additional information on goodwill, see Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q.Income taxesFor a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes, see Income taxes on page 182 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Litigation reservesFor a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, see Note 23 on pages 170–179 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 31 on pages 316–325 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.87ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTSPresentation of other comprehensive incomeIn February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures of any reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance was effective in the first quarter of 2013. The application of this guidance had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. For further information, see Note 19 on page 163 of this Form 10-Q. Balance sheet nettingIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial assets and liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting agreements or similar agreements, or that have otherwise been offset on the balance sheet under certain specific conditions that permit net presentation. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance is limited to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. The Firm adopted the new guidance, effective January 1, 2013. The application of this guidance had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. For further information, see Notes 1, 5, and 12 on pages 95, 109–119, and 127–128, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.88FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSFrom time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forward-looking statements.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, see Note 24 on pages 180–181 of this Form 10-Q.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.The unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2012 Annual Report”).Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the balance sheet when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivatives transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrow and loan agreements. A master netting agreement is a single  contract with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that contract to be terminated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due after expiration of any grace period). Upon the exercise of termination rights by the non-defaulting party, (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive value or “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative value or “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of repurchase agreement and securities loan default rights (i) all securities loan transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in or title transfer of securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.For further discussion on the Firm’s derivative instruments, see Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q. For further discussion on the Firm’s repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, see Note 12 on pages 127–128 of this Form 10-Q. 95Note 2 – Business changes and developments Other business events and Subsequent events Issuance of preferred stockOn February 5, 2013 the Firm issued $900 million of noncumulative preferred stock. On April 23, 2013 the Firm issued $1.5 billion of noncumulative preferred stock. For additional information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 300 of the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report.Redemption of outstanding trust preferred securitiesOn May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0 billion, or 100% of the liquidation amount, of the following eight series of trust preferred securities: JPMorgan Chase Capital X, JPMorgan Chase Capital XI, JPMorgan Chase Capital XII, JPMorgan Chase Capital XIV, JPMorgan Chase Capital XVI, JPMorgan Chase Capital XIX, JPMorgan Chase Capital XXIV, and BANK ONE Capital VI. For a further discussion of trust preferred securities, see Note 21 on pages 297–299 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.

enterprise obligations of $118.0 billion and $119.4 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, included within trading loans were $22.7 billion and $26.4 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $15.0 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, market 98approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, see Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions) when the long and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”).(e)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Therefore, the balances reported in the fair value hierarchy table are gross of any counterparty netting adjustments. However, if the Firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivables and payables balances would be $6.8 billion and $8.4 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.(f)Private equity instruments represent investments within the Corporate/Private Equity line of business. The cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $8.6 billion and $8.4 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.(g)Includes investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds that do not have readily determinable fair values. The Firm uses net asset value per share when measuring the fair value of these investments. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the fair values of these investments were $3.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of which $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively were classified in level 2, and $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, in level 3.(h)Prior period amounts have been revised.Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basisFor the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 and from level 2 into level 3.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, certain highly rated CLOs, including $27.3 billion held in the AFS securities portfolio and $1.3 billion held in the trading portfolio, were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency.For the three months ended March 31, 2012, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $1.2 billion of derivative payables based on increased observability of certain structured equity derivatives. All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period.Level 3 valuationsThe Firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 196–214 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs — including, but not limited to, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of  comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Finally, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters, where relevant. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input range does not reflect the level of input uncertainty, instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of 99the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period to period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3, the equity and interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were  concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range presented. In addition the equity and interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while commodities volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range.Level 3 inputs(a) March 31, 2013 (in millions, except for ratios and basis points)     Product/InstrumentFair valuePrincipal valuation techniqueUnobservable inputsRange of input valuesWeighted averageResidential mortgage-backed securities and loans$9,370Discounted cash flowsYield3 %-15%7%  Prepayment speed0 %-42%7%   Conditional default rate0 %-100%11%   Loss severity0 %-82%11%Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(b)1,958Discounted cash flowsYield2 %-25%6%  Conditional default rate0 %-8%0%   Loss severity0 %-40%4%Corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, and other13,942Discounted cash flowsCredit spread130 bps-225 bps149 bps  Yield2 %-31%10%3,825Market comparablesPrice20-13593Net interest rate derivatives2,791Option pricingInterest rate correlation(75)%-94%    Interest rate spread volatility0 %-60% Net credit derivatives(b)1,317Discounted cash flowsCredit correlation31 %-90% Net foreign exchange derivatives(1,516)Option pricingForeign exchange correlation35 %-75% Net equity derivatives(1,000)Option pricingEquity volatility5 %-45% Net commodity derivatives182Option pricingCommodity volatility17 %-36% Collateralized loan obligations1,000Discounted cash flowsCredit spread160 bps-550 bps205 bps   Prepayment speed15 %-20%19%   Conditional default rate2%2%   Loss severity40%40% 624Market comparablesPrice0-12584Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)7,949Discounted cash flowsRefer to Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q.

The estimation of the fair value of structured notes is predominantly based on the derivative features embedded within the instruments. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(e)The range has not been disclosed due to the wide range of possible values given the diverse nature of the underlying investments.100Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions see Note 3 on pages 196-214 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheet amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.101 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  Three months endedMarch 31, 2013(in millions)Fair value at January 1, 2013Total realized/unrealized

The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2012, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 105 of this Form 10-Q.Three months ended March 31, 2013Level 3 assets were $67.4 billion at March 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of $31.8 billion from December 31, 2012 due to the following:•$26.9 billion decrease in asset-backed AFS securities and a $2.1 billion decrease in asset-backed trading securities predominantly driven by transfers of highly rated CLOs from level 3 into level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency;•$1.4 billion decrease in derivative receivables driven by a $1.2 billion decrease from the impact of tightening reference entity credit spreads and risk reductions in credit derivatives and decreases of $1.4 billion across interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives due to market movements. These were partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in equity derivatives due to market movements. Gains and lossesThe following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 97–99 of this Form 10-Q.Three months ended March 31, 2013•$851 million and $537 million of net gains on assets and liabilities, respectively, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, none of which were individually significant.Three months ended March 31, 2012•$1.6 billion of net losses on derivatives, related to tightening of credit spreads, partially offset by gains in interest rate derivatives.104Credit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record adjustments to the Firm’s estimates of fair value in order to reflect the counterparty credit quality and Firm’s own creditworthiness:•Credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) are taken to reflect the credit quality of a counterparty in the valuation of derivatives. CVA adjustments are necessary when the market price (or parameter) is not indicative of the credit quality of the counterparty. As few classes of derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, derivative positions are predominantly valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. An adjustment is necessary to reflect the credit quality of each derivative counterparty to arrive at fair value. The adjustment also takes into account contractual factors designed to reduce the Firm’s credit exposure to each counterparty, such as collateral and legal rights of offset.•Debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) are taken to reflect the credit quality of the Firm in the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology to determine the adjustment is generally consistent with CVA and incorporates JPMorgan Chase’s credit spread as observed through the credit default swap (“CDS”) market.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity, reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.(in millions)Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012Derivative receivables balance (net of derivatives CVA)$70,609 $74,983Derivatives CVA(a)(3,906) (4,238)Derivative payables balance (net of derivatives DVA)61,989 70,656Derivatives DVA(825) (830)Structured notes balance (net of structured notes DVA)(b)(c)50,502 48,112Structured notes DVA(1,843) (1,712)(a)Derivatives CVA, gross of hedges, includes results managed by the credit portfolio and other lines of business within the Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”).(b)Structured notes are recorded within long-term debt, other borrowed funds or deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending upon the tenor and legal form of the note.(c)Structured notes are measured at fair value based on the Firm’s election under the fair value option. For further information on these elections, see Note 4 on pages 107–108 of this Form 10-Q. The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.

For further information on these elections, see Note 4 on pages 107–108 of this Form 10-Q.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisAt March 31, 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $1.0 billion and predominantly consisted of loans that had fair value adjustments in the first three months of 2013. At December 31, 2012, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $5.1 billion, comprised predominantly of loans that had fair value adjustments in the twelve months of 2012. At March 31, 2013, $176 million and $811 million of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At December 31, 2012, $667 million and $4.4 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $1.0 billion of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $733 million related to residential real estate loans measured at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3, as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 18% to 59%, with a weighted average of 29%.The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $299 million and $534 million, respectively; these reductions in recorded value were predominantly associated with loans.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 on pages 250–275 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.105Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair valueThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 on pages 196–214 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see pages 196–214 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report and pages 96–107 of this Note.The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm’s wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

These totals include adjustments for structured notes classified within deposits and other borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt.(b)Structured notes are debt instruments with embedded derivatives that are tailored to meet a client’s need. The embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of such risk management instruments.(c)Reported in mortgage fees and related income.(d)Reported in other income.107Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note.(c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflected as the remaining contractual principal is the final principal payment at maturity.At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(72) million and $(75) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 on pages 308–315 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report, and Note 21 on pages 166–170 of this Form 10-Q.108Note 5 – Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 on pages 218-227 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge  accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.Type of DerivativeUse of DerivativeDesignation and disclosureAffected segment or unit10-Q page referenceManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:   ◦ Interest rateHedge fixed rate assets and liabilitiesFair value hedgeCorporate/PE116◦ Interest rateHedge floating rate assets and liabilitiesCash flow hedgeCorporate/PE117◦ Foreign exchange Hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilitiesFair value hedgeCorporate/PE116◦ Foreign exchange Hedge forecasted revenue and expenseCash flow hedgeCorporate/PE117◦ Foreign exchange Hedge the value of the Firm’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiariesNet investment hedgeCorporate/PE118◦ Commodity Hedge commodity inventoryFair value hedgeCIB116Manage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:   ◦ Interest rateManage the risk of the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRsSpecified risk managementCCB118◦ CreditManage the credit risk of wholesale lending exposuresSpecified risk managementCIB118◦ Credit(a)Manage the credit risk of certain AFS securitiesSpecified risk managementCorporate/PE118◦ CommodityManage the risk of certain commodities-related contracts and investmentsSpecified risk managementCIB118◦ Interest rate and foreign exchangeManage the risk of certain other specified assets and liabilitiesSpecified risk managementCorporate/PE118Market-making derivatives and other activities:   ◦ VariousMarket-making and related risk managementMarket-making and otherCIB118◦ Various(b)Other derivatives, including the synthetic credit portfolioMarket-making and otherCIB, Corporate/PE118(a)Includes a limited number of single-name credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk arising from specified AFS securities.(b)The synthetic credit portfolio is a portfolio of index credit derivatives, including short and long positions, that was held by CIO. On July 2, 2012, CIO transferred the synthetic credit portfolio, other than a portion that aggregated to a notional amount of approximately $12 billion, to CIB. The positions making up the portion of the synthetic credit portfolio retained by CIO on July 2, 2012, were effectively closed out during the third quarter of 2012. The results of the synthetic credit portfolio, including the portion transferred to CIB, have been included in the gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives category on page 118 of this Note.109Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.

These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is non-cash  financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables not nettable under U.S. GAAP. The following tables present information regarding certain non-cash financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012 that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the U.S. GAAP nettable derivative instruments and excludes additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and excludes all collateral related to derivative instruments not nettable under U.S. GAAP.

Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating provided by major rating agencies.Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives      March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions)Single-notch downgradeTwo-notch downgrade Single-notch downgradeTwo-notch downgradeAmount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a)$1,114$3,702 $1,234$4,090Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b)7971,162 8571,270(a)Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. The current presentation excludes accrued interest. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to changes in foreign currency rates, were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(c)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(d)Included $4.0 billion and $(2.8) billion for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of revenue related to certain foreign exchange trading derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments.(e)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.(f)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time values.116Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily net interest income, noninterest revenue and compensation expense.(c)The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.(d)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $98 million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) at March 31, 2013, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 8 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.117Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) 2013 2012Three months ended March 31,(in millions)Excluded components recorded directly in income(a)Effective portion recorded in OCI Excluded components recorded directly in income(a)Effective portion recorded in OCIForeign exchange derivatives $(77) $420  $(55) $(267)(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, AFS securities, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities related contracts and investments.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and single-name credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk arising from certain AFS securities. These derivatives do not include the synthetic credit portfolio or credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, both of which are included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(c)Primarily relates to hedges of the foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(d)Primarily relates to commodity derivatives used to mitigate energy price risk associated with energy-related contracts and investments. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-makingactivities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm’s market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives (including the synthetic credit portfolio) that are not included in the hedge  accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 on page 120 of this Form 10-Q for information on principal transactions revenue. Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 on pages 218–227 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain AFS securities and from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. For more information on the synthetic credit portfolio, see footnote (b) to the table on page 109 of this Note.The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes.118The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation,  or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes Maximum payout/Notional amountMarch 31, 2013 (in millions)Protection soldProtection purchased with identical underlyings(b)Net protection (sold)/purchased(c)Other protection purchased(d)Credit derivatives     Credit default swaps$(3,191,033) $3,158,710$(32,323)$12,971Other credit derivatives(a)(78,120) 18,681(59,439)29,595Total credit derivatives(3,269,153) 3,177,391(91,762)42,566Credit-related notes(194) —(194)3,575Total$(3,269,347) $3,177,391$(91,956)$46,141       Maximum payout/Notional amountDecember 31, 2012 (in millions)Protection soldProtection purchased with identical underlyings(b)Net protection (sold)/purchased(c)Other protection purchased(d)Credit derivatives     Credit default swaps$(2,954,705) $2,879,105$(75,600)$42,460Other credit derivatives(a)(66,244) 5,649(60,595)33,174Total credit derivatives(3,020,949) 2,884,754(136,195)75,634Credit-related notes(233) —(233)3,255Total$(3,021,182) $2,884,754$(136,428)$78,889(a)Primarily consists of total return swaps and CDS options.(b)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.(c)Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.(d)Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.The following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.Protection sold – credit derivatives and credit-related notes ratings(a)/maturity profile   March 31, 2013 (in millions)<1 year1–5 years>5 yearsTotal notional amountFair value of receivables(b)Fair value of payables(b)Net fair valueRisk rating of reference entity       Investment-grade$(439,302)$(1,596,456)$(297,138)$(2,332,896)$20,988$(22,255)$(1,267)Noninvestment-grade(231,664)(621,285)(83,502)(936,451)22,922(32,756)(9,834)Total$(670,966)$(2,217,741)$(380,640)$(3,269,347)$43,910$(55,011)$(11,101)December 31, 2012 (in millions)<1 year1–5 years>5 yearsTotal notional amountFair value of receivables(b)Fair value of payables(b)Net fair valueRisk rating of reference entity       Investment-grade$(409,748)$(1,383,644)$(224,001)$(2,017,393)$16,690$(22,393)$(5,703)Noninvestment-grade(214,949)(722,115)(66,725)(1,003,789)22,355(36,815)(14,460)Total$(624,697)$(2,105,759)$(290,726)$(3,021,182)$39,045$(59,208)$(20,163)(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.(b)Amounts are shown on a gross basis, before the benefit of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received by the Firm. 119Note 6 – Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm’s noninterest revenue, see Note 7 on pages 228–229 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.

The Firm, through its Global Commodities Group within CIB (“Commodities Group”) generally provides risk management, investment and financing solutions to clients globally both through financial derivatives transactions, as well as through physical commodities transactions. On the financial side, the Commodities Group engages in OTC derivatives transactions (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and exchange-traded derivatives referencing various types of commodities (see below and Note 5 - Derivative instruments for further information). On the physical side, the Commodities Group engages in the purchase, sale, transport, and storage of power, gas, liquefied natural gas, coal, crude oil, refined products, precious and base metals among others. Realized gains and losses and unrealized losses arising from market-making and client-driven activities involving physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value), subject to any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Fees relating to storage and transportation are recorded in Other Income. These fees are generally recognized over the arrangement period. Expenses relating to such activities are recorded in other expense (see Note 10- Noninterest expense for further information).In addition, principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities disclosed separately in Note 5, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives, including the synthetic credit portfolio. See Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q  for information on the income statement classification of gains and losses on derivatives.The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue by major underlying type of risk exposures.

Except for certain securities that the Firm intends to sell for which the unrealized losses have been recognized in income, as of March 31, 2013, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2013.125Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March 31, 2013, of JPMorgan Chase’s AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.By remaining maturityMarch 31, 2013(in millions)Due in one year or lessDue after one year through five yearsDue after five years through 10 yearsDue after 10 years(c)TotalAvailable-for-sale debt securities     Mortgage-backed securities(a)     Amortized cost$142$13,090$11,304$153,911$178,447Fair value14213,54211,798159,355184,837Average yield(b)2.40%1.98%3.19%3.24%3.15%U.S. Treasury and government agencies(a)     Amortized cost$6,133$1,804$2,832$1,035$11,804Fair value6,1521,8542,8531,07111,930Average yield(b)0.57%1.91%0.75%0.72%0.83%Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities     Amortized cost$23$435$1,088$17,855$19,401Fair value234701,16119,32420,978Average yield(b)3.35%5.43%3.69%5.85%5.72%Certificates of deposit     Amortized cost$2,322$51$—$—$2,373Fair value2,32554——2,379Average yield(b)6.23%3.28%—%—%6.17%Non-U.S. government debt securities     Amortized cost$18,728$21,971$26,319$2,427$69,445Fair value18,77122,20926,8442,54370,367Average yield(b)1.09%2.13%1.46%1.77%1.58%Corporate debt securities     Amortized cost$3,927$20,617$7,936$136$32,616Fair value3,94221,0168,14713433,239Average yield(b)2.73%2.30%2.54%2.87%2.41%Asset-backed securities     Amortized cost$—$2,975$12,411$23,579$38,965Fair value—3,00812,62123,90439,533Average yield(b)—%1.92%1.85%1.95%1.92%Total available-for-sale debt securities     Amortized cost$31,275$60,943$61,890$198,943$353,051Fair value31,35562,15363,424206,331363,263Average yield(b)1.58%2.16%2.00%3.29%2.72%Available-for-sale equity securities     Amortized cost$—$—$—$2,458$2,458Fair value———2,4742,474Average yield(b)—%—%—%0.18%0.18%Total available-for-sale securities     Amortized cost$31,275$60,943$61,890$201,401$355,509Fair value31,35562,15363,424208,805365,737Average yield(b)1.58%2.16%2.00%3.26%2.70%Total held-to-maturity securities     Amortized cost$—$6$1$—$7Fair value—61—7Average yield(b)—%6.85%6.64%—%6.84%(a)U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were the only issuers whose securities exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2013.(b)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)Includes securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately three years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, two years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and three years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 126Note 12 – Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 on page 249 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions.  The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, accounts payable and other liabilities, and long-term debt, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.128Note 13 – LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans•Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair value•PCI loans held-for-investment For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 250–275 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 107–108 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(c)Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Home equity – senior lien• Home equity – junior lien• Prime mortgage, including  option ARMs• Subprime mortgageOther consumer loans• Auto(b)• Business banking(b)• Student and otherResidential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other(a)Includes loans reported in CCB and residential real estate loans reported in the AM and Corporate/Private Equity business segments.(b)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.(c)Includes loans reported in CIB, CB and AM business segments and in Corporate/Private Equity.129The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.March 31, 2013Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit card(a)WholesaleTotal (in millions) Retained$290,082$121,865$310,582$722,529(b) Held-for-sale——4,1964,196 At fair value——2,1612,161 Total$290,082$121,865$316,939$728,886       December 31, 2012Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit card(a)WholesaleTotal (in millions) Retained$292,620$127,993$306,222$726,835(b) Held-for-sale——4,4064,406 At fair value——2,5552,555 Total$292,620$127,993$313,183$733,796 (a)Includes billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.(b)Loans (other than PCI loans and those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and premiums, and net deferred loan costs of $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.The following table provides information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value. On an ongoing basis, the Firm manages its exposure to credit risk. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.  2013 2012Three months endedMarch 31,(in millions) Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotal  Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit cardWholesaleTotal Purchases $2,625$—$95$2,720  $1,759$—$321$2,080 Sales 1,429—1,1532,582  357—8631,220 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale ——344344  —92362985 The following table provides information about gains/(losses) on loan sales by portfolio segment.

The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens and mortgage loans with interest-only payment options to predominantly prime borrowers, as well as certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.(in millions)Mar 31, 2013Dec 31, 2012Residential real estate – excluding PCI  Home equity:  Senior lien$18,743$19,385Junior lien46,05548,000Mortgages:  Prime, including option ARMs77,62676,256Subprime8,0038,255Other consumer loans  Auto50,55249,913Business banking18,73918,883Student and other11,92712,191Residential real estate – PCI  Home equity20,52520,971Prime mortgage13,36613,674Subprime mortgage4,5614,626Option ARMs19,98520,466Total retained loans$290,082$292,620 Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans, excluding credit card. Other indicators that are taken into consideration for consumer loans, excluding credit card, include:•For residential real estate loans, including both non-PCI and PCI portfolios, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans; the geographic distribution of the loan collateral; and the borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score.•For scored auto, scored business banking and student loans, the geographic distribution of the loans.•For risk-rated business banking and auto loans, the risk rating of the loan; the geographic considerations relevant to the loan; and whether the loan is considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual.•For all business banking loans, the industry specific conditions relevant to the loans.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 250–275 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Residential real estate – excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate – excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm’s residential real estate – excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.131Residential real estate – excluding PCI loans  Home equity (in millions, except ratios)Senior lien  Junior lien Mar 31, 2013  Dec 31, 2012  Mar 31, 2013  Dec 31, 2012 Loan delinquency(a)           Current$18,096  $18,688  $45,019  $46,805 30–149 days past due289  330  788  960 150 or more days past due358  367  248  235 Total retained loans$18,743  $19,385  $46,055  $48,000 % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans3.45%  3.60%  2.25%  2.49% 90 or more days past due and still accruing$—  $—  $—  $— 90 or more days past due and government guaranteed(b)—  —  —  — Nonaccrual loans943  931  2,161  2,277 Current estimated LTV ratios(c)(d)(e)           Greater than 125% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 660$134  $197  $3,523  $4,561 Less than 66067  93  1,086  1,338 101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 660416  491  6,684  7,089 Less than 660172  191  1,918  1,971 80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 6601,348  1,502  9,233  9,604 Less than 660446  485  2,291  2,279 Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 66013,725  13,988  18,321  18,252 Less than 6602,435  2,438  2,999  2,906 U.S. government-guaranteed—  —  —  — Total retained loans$18,743  $19,385  $46,055  $48,000 Geographic region           California$2,695  $2,786  $10,513  $10,969 New York2,780  2,847  9,407  9,753 Illinois1,322  1,358  3,145  3,265 Florida871  892  2,475  2,572 Texas2,386  2,508  1,423  1,503 New Jersey640  652  2,736  2,838 Arizona1,141  1,183  2,061  2,151 Washington627  651  1,564  1,629 Ohio1,458  1,514  1,037  1,091 Michigan880  910  1,117  1,169 All other(f)3,943  4,084  10,577  11,060 Total retained loans$18,743  $19,385  $46,055  $48,000 (a)Individual delinquency classifications included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion; 30–149 days past due included $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion; and 150 or more days past due included $9.8 billion and $9.5 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.(b)These balances, which are 90 days or more past due but insured by U.S. government agencies, are excluded from nonaccrual loans. In predominately all cases, 100% of the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. These amounts are excluded from nonaccrual loans because reimbursement of insured and guaranteed amounts is proceeding normally. At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, these balances included $6.9 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest because interest has been curtailed by the U.S. government agencies although, in predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal is still insured. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate.(c)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates.(d)Junior lien represents combined LTV, which considers all available lien positions related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(e)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(f)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $15.5 billion and $15.6 billion, respectively.(g)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $11.9 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively. These amounts were excluded as reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally.132(table continued from previous page)Mortgages     Prime, including option ARMs  Subprime  Total residential real estate – excluding PCI  Mar 31, 2013  Dec 31, 2012  Mar 31, 2013  Dec 31, 2012  Mar 31, 2013  Dec 31, 2012                    $62,906  $61,439  $6,571  $6,673  $132,592  $133,605  2,991  3,237  631  727  4,699  5,254  11,729  11,580  801  855  13,136  13,037  $77,626  $76,256  $8,003  $8,255  $150,427  $151,896  3.59%(g)  3.97%(g)  17.89%  19.16%  3.92%(g)  4.28%(g)  $—  $—  $—  $—  $—  $—  10,871  10,625  —  —  10,871  10,625  3,479  3,445  1,792  1,807  8,375  8,460                                      $2,164  $2,573  $175  $236  $5,996  $7,567  813  991  529  653  2,495  3,075                    3,214  3,697  429  457  10,743  11,734  1,280  1,376  941  985  4,311  4,523                    6,530  7,070  708  726  17,819  18,902  2,058  2,117  1,322  1,346  6,117  6,227                    41,286  38,281  1,794  1,793  75,126  72,314  4,758  4,549  2,105  2,059  12,297  11,952  15,523  15,602  —  —  15,523  15,602  $77,626  $76,256  $8,003  $8,255  $150,427  $151,896                    $18,046  $17,539  $1,202  $1,240  $32,456  $32,534  11,638  11,190  1,054  1,081  24,879  24,871  4,221  3,999  312  323  9,000  8,945  4,398  4,372  1,002  1,031  8,746  8,867  2,979  2,927  250  257  7,038  7,195  2,204  2,131  393  399  5,973  6,020  1,167  1,162  161  165  4,530  4,661  1,730  1,741  171  177  4,092  4,198  403  405  184  191  3,082  3,201  873  866  197  203  3,067  3,148  29,967  29,924  3,077  3,188  47,564  48,256  $77,626  $76,256  $8,003  $8,255  $150,427  $151,896  133The following tables represent the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.

That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options  available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm’s delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.134Impaired loansThe Firm reported, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status.The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on page 150 of this Form 10-Q.

For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 14 on pages 250–253 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.135The following table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Three months ended March 31,Average impaired loans Interest income onimpaired loans(a) Interest income on impaired loans on a cash basis(a)(in millions)20132012 20132012 20132012Home equity        Senior lien$1,139$336 $15$3 $10$1Junior lien1,272686 206 131Mortgages        Prime, including option ARMs7,1874,949 6949 145Subprime3,8273,216 5042 154Total residential real estate – excluding PCI$13,425$9,187 $154$100 $52$11(a)Generally, interest income on loans modified in TDRs is recognized on a cash basis until such time as the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms.Loan modificationsThe global settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required the Firm to, among other things, provide $3.7 billion of additional relief to certain borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program, including reductions of principal on first and second liens. The Firm continues to modify first and second lien loans under the Consumer Relief Program. These loan modifications are primarily being executed under the terms of either the U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable (“MHA”) programs (e.g., the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”), the Second Lien Modification Program (“2MP”)) or one of the Firm’s proprietary modification programs. For further information on the global settlement, see Mortgage Foreclosure-Related Investigations and Litigation in Note 23 on page 177 of this Form 10-Q. Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. For further information, see Note 14 on page 252 and pages 260–262 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.136TDR activity rollforwardThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, modified in TDRs for the periods presented.Three months endedMarch 31,(in millions)Home equity Mortgages Total residentialreal estate – excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012Beginning balance of TDRs$1,092$335 $1,223$657 $7,118$4,877 $3,812$3,219 $13,245$9,088New TDRs10112 13596 310281 128122 674511Charge-offs post-modification(a)(10)(5) (33)(17) (19)(34) (38)(51) (100)(107)Foreclosures and other liquidations (e.g., short sales)(4)— (4)(3) (35)(29) (19)(37) (62)(69)Principal payments and other(24)(4) (35)(27) (151)(77) (40)(27) (250)(135)Ending balance of TDRs(b)$1,155$338 $1,286$706 $7,223$5,018 $3,843$3,226 $13,507$9,288Permanent modifications(b)$1,116$296 $1,281$695 $6,958$4,768 $3,686$3,067 $13,041$8,826Trial modifications$39$42 $5$11 $265$250 $157$159 $466$462(a)Includes charge-offs on unsuccessful trial modifications.(b)At March 31, 2013, included $1.7 billion of Chapter 7 loans consisting of $482 million of senior lien home equity loans, $501 million of junior lien home equity loans, $441 million of prime, including option ARMs, and $236 million of subprime mortgages. Certain of these individual loans were previously reported as nonaccrual loans (e.g., based upon the delinquency status of the loan).Nature and extent of modificationsMHA, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and  deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At March 31, 2013, there were approximately 39,400 of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 9,600 senior lien home equity loans, 22,500 junior lien home equity loans, 3,600 prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 3,700 subprime mortgages.Three months endedMarch 31,Home equity Mortgages Total residentialreal estate - excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012Number of loans approved for a trial modification(a)500371 196248 976972 1,4891,192 3,1612,783Number of loans permanently modified545230 1,3161,816 1,476950 1,6891,190 5,0264,186Concession granted:(a)(b)              Interest rate reduction73%67% 90%95% 75%76% 69%84% 77%86%Term or payment extension7396 7867 6976 5057 6568Principal and/or interest deferred1011 2320 2738 1113 1922Principal forgiveness3927 408 4120 5630 4618Other(c)—— —— 244 163 122(a)Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.(b)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified.

Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.Three months ended March 31,(in millions, except weighted-average data and number of loans)Home equity Mortgages Total residential real estate – excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012Weighted-average interest rate of loans with interest rate reductions – before TDR6.37%7.01% 5.19%5.68% 5.64%5.90% 7.69%8.28% 6.20%6.60%Weighted-average interest rate of loans with interest rate reductions – after TDR3.513.21 2.161.71 2.872.59 3.583.83 3.032.81Weighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) of loans with term or payment extensions – before TDR1920 1922 2427 2326 2325Weighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) of loans with term or payment extensions – after TDR3127 3333 3636 3432 3534Charge-offs recognized upon permanent modification$2$1 $19$6 $5$14 $3$5 $29$26Principal deferred21 76 3535 1010 5452Principal forgiven102 164 7320 8431 18357Number of loans that redefaulted within one year of permanent modification(a)14768 380411 234248 368374 1,1291,101Balance of loans that redefaulted within one year of permanent modification(a)$11$5 $7$16 $54$67 $37$41 $109$129(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the period presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.Approximately 85% of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the HAMP program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At March 31, 2013, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months are 19% for senior lien home equity, 17% for junior lien home equity, 14% for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 24% for subprime mortgages. Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge. Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10% and 40% in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At March 31, 2013, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 21% of senior lien home equity, 14% of junior lien home equity, 41% of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 30% of subprime mortgages that were 30 days or more past due.At March 31, 2013, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6 years for senior lien home equity, 7 years for junior lien home equity, 10 years for prime mortgage, including option ARMs and 8 years for subprime mortgage. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).138Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.(in millions, except ratios)Auto Business banking Student and other Total other consumer Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012 Mar 31, 2013Dec 31, 2012 Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012 Mar 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2012 Loan delinquency(a)               Current$50,086 $49,290 $18,341$18,482 $10,801 $11,038 $79,228 $78,810 30–119 days past due459 616 262263 690 709 1,411 1,588 120 or more days past due7 7 136138 436 444 579 589 Total retained loans$50,552 $49,913 $18,739$18,883 $11,927 $12,191 $81,218 $80,987 % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans0.92% 1.25% 2.12%2.12% 2.05%(d) 2.12%(d) 1.37%(d) 1.58%(d) 90 or more days past due and still accruing (b)$— $— $—$— $523 $525 $523 $525 Nonaccrual loans135 163 458481 80 70 673 714 Geographic region               California$5,099 $4,962 $2,026$1,983 $1,098 $1,108 $8,223 $8,053 New York3,836 3,742 2,9552,981 1,209 1,202 8,000 7,925 Illinois2,826 2,738 1,3761,404 740 748 4,942 4,890 Florida1,911 1,922 546527 547 556 3,004 3,005 Texas4,739 4,739 2,7182,749 864 891 8,321 8,379 New Jersey2,000 1,921 367379 403 409 2,770 2,709 Arizona1,705 1,719 1,1111,139 263 265 3,079 3,123 Washington870 824 210202 221 287 1,301 1,313 Ohio2,400 2,462 1,4161,443 755 770 4,571 4,675 Michigan2,112 2,091 1,3611,368 537 548 4,010 4,007 All other23,054 22,793 4,6534,708 5,290 5,407 32,997 32,908 Total retained loans$50,552 $49,913 $18,739$18,883 $11,927 $12,191 $81,218 $80,987 Loans by risk ratings(c)               Noncriticized$9,009 $8,882 $13,323$13,336 NA NA $22,332 $22,218 Criticized performing82 130 705713 NA NA 787 843 Criticized nonaccrual4 4 371386 NA NA 375 390 (a)Individual delinquency classifications included loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) as follows: current included $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion; 30-119 days past due included $462 million and $466 million; and 120 or more days past due included $420 million and $428 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.(b)These amounts represent student loans, which are insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP.

Certain of these loans were previously reported as nonaccrual loans (e.g., based upon the delinquency status of the loan). Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsFor auto loans, TDRs typically occur in connection with the bankruptcy of the borrower. In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness. Beginning September 30, 2012, Chapter 7 auto loans are also considered TDRs.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions.The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the  payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $12 million and $11 million, during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The balance of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $13 million and $7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans for the periods presented.

As a result, an allowance for loan losses for impairment of these pools has been recognized.(c)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions related to the property.(d)Refreshed FICO scores, which the Firm obtains at least quarterly, represent each borrower’s most recent credit score.142Approximately 21% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.

The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.(in millions, except ratios)Total PCIThree months ended March 31,20132012Beginning balance$18,457$19,072Accretion into interest income(573)(658)Changes in interest rates on variable-rate loans(159)(140)Other changes in expected cash flows(a)1,7391,443Balance at March 31$19,464$19,717Accretable yield percentage4.35%4.48%(a)Other changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the Firm continues to refine its cash flow model and periodically updates model assumptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, other changes in expected cash flows were due to refining the expected interest cash flows on HELOCs with balloon payments; these incremental interest cash flows will not have a significant impact on the accretable yield percentage. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, other changes in expected cash flows were principally driven by the impact of modifications, but also related to changes in prepayment assumptions. Changes to prepayment assumptions change the expected remaining life of the portfolio, which drives changes in expected future interest cash collections. Such changes do not have a significant impact on the accretable yield percentage.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Since the date of acquisition, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended or shortened loan liquidation periods, affect the  timing of expected cash flows and the accretable yield percentage, but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). While extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage (because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time), shortened loan liquidation periods would have the opposite effect.143Credit card loan portfolioThe Credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due), as well as information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due). In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality. However, the distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio. Refreshed FICO score information for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the table below; FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. For more information on credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 250–275 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology.

At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, $283 million and $341 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $206 million and $232 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Three monthsendedMarch 31,(in millions)20132012Average impaired credit card loans$4,521$6,845Interest income on impaired credit card loans5889Loan modificationsJPMorgan Chase may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications under long-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. The Firm may also offer short-term programs for borrowers who may be in need of temporary relief. Modifications under all short- and long-term programs typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Certain borrowers enrolled in a short-term modification program may be given the option to re-enroll in a long-term program. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. Assuming that the cardholder does not begin to perform in accordance with those payment terms, the loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In addition, if a borrower successfully completes a short-term modification program, then the loan reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. However, in most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.The following table provides information regarding the nature and extent of modifications of credit card loans for the periods presented.

The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 36.49% for credit card loans modified as of March 31, 2013 and 38.23% for credit card loans modified as of December 31, 2012.145Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating  assigned each loan.

For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 2.4 years and 0.9 years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all wholesale loans modified during these periods was 1.7 years and 4.1 years, respectively. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification were zero and $47 million during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.149Note 14 – Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 on pages 276–279 JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. 2013 2012Three months ended March 31, (in millions)Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card WholesaleTotal Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card WholesaleTotalAllowance for loan losses             Beginning balance at January 1,$12,292 $5,501 $4,143$21,936 $16,294 $6,999 $4,316$27,609Gross charge-offs720 1,248 662,034 1,134 1,627 922,853Gross recoveries(112) (166) (31)(309) (138) (241) (87)(466)Net charge-offs/(recoveries)608 1,082 351,725 996 1,386 52,387Provision for loan losses(37) 582 24569 2 636 8646Other(2) (3) 5— (3) 2 43Ending balance at March 31,$11,645 $4,998 $4,137$20,780 $15,297 $6,251 $4,323$25,871              Allowance for loan losses by impairment methodology             Asset-specific(a)$771 $1,434(b) $228$2,433 $760 $2,402(b) $448$3,610Formula-based5,163 3,564 3,90912,636 8,826 3,849 3,87516,550PCI5,711 — —5,711 5,711 — —5,711Total allowance for loan losses$11,645 $4,998 $4,137$20,780 $15,297 $6,251 $4,323$25,871              Loans by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$14,189 $4,287 $1,302$19,778 $10,059 $6,524 $2,058$18,641Formula-based217,456 117,578 309,271644,305 230,650 117,951 281,573630,174PCI58,437 — 958,446 64,061 — 2264,083Total retained loans$290,082 $121,865 $310,582$722,529 $304,770 $124,475 $283,653$712,898              Impaired collateral-dependent loans             Net charge-offs$78 $— $6$84 $29 $— $24$53Loans measured at fair value of collateral less cost to sell3,153 — 4323,585 849 — 7901,639              Allowance for lending-related commitments             Beginning balance at January 1,$7 $— $661$668 $7 $— $666$673Provision for lending-related commitments— — 4848 (1) — 8180Other— — —— 1 — (4)(3)Ending balance at March 31,$7 $— $709$716 $7 $— $743$750              Allowance for lending-related commitments by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$— $— $82$82 $— $— $187$187Formula-based7 — 627634 7 — 556563Total allowance for lending-related commitments$7 $— $709$716 $7 $— $743$750              Lending-related commitments by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$— $— $244$244 $— $— $756$756Formula-based60,874 537,455 435,0371,033,366 63,121 533,318 400,308996,747Total lending-related commitments$60,874 $537,455 $435,281$1,033,610 $63,121 $533,318 $401,064$997,503(a)Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR.(b)The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses is related to loans that have been modified in a TDR; such allowance is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.150Note 15 – Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”), see Note 1 on pages 193–194 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.

This includes the Firm’s primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 155 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CIB and CCB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 on pages 281–284 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.151The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 156 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 156–157 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

The Firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.(c)The table above excludes the following: retained servicing (see Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of MSRs); securities retained from loans sales to U.S. government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities (See Note 5 on pages 109–119 of this Form 10-Q for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $319 million and $94 million, respectively, at March 31, 2013, and $131 million and $45 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.(d)Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.(e)As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, 75% and 74%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $177 million and $170 million of investment-grade and $233 million and $171 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion of investment-grade and $139 million and $164 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.152Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 on page 283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 155 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 on page 283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. See the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 on pages 283–284 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Firm transferred $4.2 billion and $2.9 billion , respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and zero and $241 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm consolidated $83 million and $76 million, respectively, of assets, and $2 million and $5 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 155 of this Note for more information on the consolidated re-securitization transactions. As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $3.9 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm held approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $21 million and $61 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 152 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 284-285 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $3.8 billion and $8.3 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments were not driven by market liquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm provides lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded portion of these commitments was $10.9 billion and $10.8 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, which are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21 on pages 166–170 of this Form 10-Q.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 285–286 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.153The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows.(in billions)Fair value of assets held by VIEsLiquidity facilitiesExcess/(deficit)(a)Maximum exposureNonconsolidated municipal bond vehicles    March 31, 2013$14.3$8.1$6.2$8.1December 31, 201214.28.06.28.0 Ratings profile of VIE assets(b)Fair value of assets held by VIEsWt. avg. expected life of assets (years) Investment-grade Noninvestment- grade(in billions, except where otherwise noted)AAA to AAA-AA+ to AA-A+ to A-BBB+ to BBB- BB+ and belowMarch 31, 2013$3.1$11.0$0.2$— $—$14.35.8December 31, 20123.111.00.1— —14.25.9(a)Represents the excess/(deficit) of the fair values of municipal bond assets available to repay the liquidity facilities, if drawn.(b)The ratings scale is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.

The Firm relies on the collateral held by the VIEs to pay any amounts due under the derivatives; the vehicles are structured at inception so that the par value of the collateral is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts due under the derivative contracts. The Firm consolidated credit-related note vehicles with collateral fair values of $435 million and $483 million, at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. These consolidated VIEs included some that were structured by the Firm where the Firm provides the credit derivative, and some that have been structured by third parties where the Firm is not the credit derivative provider. The Firm consolidated these vehicles, because it held positions in these entities that provided the Firm with control. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 288 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.154Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.

The Firm consolidated $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion of student loan securitization entities as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.(d)Includes assets classified as cash, derivative receivables, AFS securities, and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.(e)The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The difference between total assets and total liabilities recognized for consolidated VIEs represents the Firm’s interest in the consolidated VIEs for each program type.(f)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $32.6 billion and $35.0 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The maturities of the long-term beneficial interests as of March 31, 2013, were as follows: $9.1 billion under one year, $16.6 billion between one and five years, and $6.9 billion over five years, all respectively.(g)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Supplemental information on loan securitizationsThe Firm securitizes and sells a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.155Securitization activityThe following table provide information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.

For the three months March 31, 2013, $2.1 billion of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and $207 million of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as cash. (c)Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from off–balance sheet, nonconsolidated entities – for example, loan repurchases due to representation and warranties and servicer clean-up calls.(d)Includes prime, Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes sales for which the Firm did not securitize the loan (including loans sold to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).(e)There were no residential mortgage securitizations during the three months ended March 31, 2012.(f)Includes commercial and student loan securitizations. There were no commercial and other securitizations during the three months ended March 31, 2012.Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “Agencies”). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans and excess mortgage servicing rights through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 on pages 308–315 of the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and third-party-sponsored securitization entities.

Gains on loans sales include the value of MSRs. (d)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.156Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21 on pages 166–170 of this Form 10-Q, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm may elect to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $15.6 billion of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominately all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and reimbursement is proceeding normally. For additional information, refer to Note 13 on pages 129–149 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 on pages 250–275 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase’s interest in securitized assets held at fair valueThe following table outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value, as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, of certain of the Firm’s retained interests in nonconsolidated VIEs (other than MSRs), that are valued using modeling techniques. The table also outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in assumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 158–161 of this Form 10-Q. Commercial and other(in millions, except rates and where otherwise noted)(a)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012JPMorgan Chase interests in securitized assets$1,290 $1,488Weighted-average life (in years)6.3 6.1Weighted-average discount rate(b)4.6% 4.1%Impact of 10% adverse change$(31) $(34)Impact of 20% adverse change(62) (65)(a)The Firm’s interests in prime mortgage securitizations were $410 million and $341 million, as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. These include retained interests in Alt-A loans and re-securitization transactions. The Firm’s interests in subprime mortgage securitizations were $54 million and $68 million, as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.(b)Incorporates the Firm’s weighted-average loss assumption.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivities also do not reflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks.157Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated equity plus goodwill capital as a proxy for the carrying amounts of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a basis similar to that used for the allocation of equity to the Firm’s lines of business, which primarily considers stand-alone peer comparisons and regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III), although economic risk capital is also considered. Proposed line of business equity levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated equity is further reviewed on a periodic basis and updated as needed. For a discussion of the primary method used to 158estimate the fair values of the reporting units, see Impairment testing on pages 291–292 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.While no impairment of goodwill was recognized, the Firm’s mortgage lending business in CCB remains at an elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of this business is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities), and the amount of equity capital required. In addition, the earnings or estimated cost of equity of the Firm’s capital markets businesses could also be affected by regulatory or legislative changes. Declines in business performance, increases in allocated equity capital, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their  associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.Mortgage servicing rightsMortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 291–295 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report and Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2013, the decrease was driven by changes in the inputs and assumptions used to derive prepayment speeds, primarily increases in home prices. (b)Included changes related to commercial real estate of $(2) million and $(2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(c)Included $21 million and $29 million related to commercial real estate at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(d)Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest to a trust, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.(e)Includes excess mortgage servicing rights transferred to an agency-sponsored trust in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). A portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired and has retained the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.159The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2013, the decrease was driven by changes in the inputs and assumptions used to derive prepayment speeds, primarily increases in home prices.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly inter-related and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsThe $153 million decrease in other intangible assets during the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due to amortization.160The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows.

The aggregate number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such options and warrants was 13 million and 169 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(b)Participating securities were included in the calculation of diluted EPS using the two-class method, as this computation was more dilutive than the calculation using the treasury stock method.162Note 19 – Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, and net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.As of or for the three months endedMarch 31, 2013Unrealized gains/(losses) on AFS securities(a) Translation adjustments, net of hedges Cash flow hedges Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (in millions)Balance at January 1, 2013 $6,868(b)   $(95)   $120   $(2,791)   $4,102  Net change (640)(c)   (13)   (62)   104   (611)  Balance at March 31, 2013 $6,228(b)   $(108)   $58   $(2,687)   $3,491                       As of or for the three months endedMarch 31, 2012Unrealized gains/(losses) on AFS securities(a) Translation adjustments, net of hedges Cash flow hedges Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (in millions)Balance at January 1, 2012 $3,565(b)   $(26)   $51   $(2,646)   $944  Net change 1,574(d)   127   (35)   35   1,701  Balance at March 31, 2012 $5,139(b)   $101   $16   $(2,611)   $2,645  (a)Represents the after-tax difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities accounted for as AFS.(b)Included after-tax unrealized losses not related to credit on debt securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income of $(56) million at January 1, 2012 and $(48) million at March 31, 2012. There were no such losses at January 1, 2013 and March 31, 2013.(c)The net change for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was due primarily to net unrealized market value decreases on AFS securities, predominantly U.S. government agency-issued MBS and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities as well as net realized gains.(d)The net change for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was due primarily to market value increases driven by tightening of spreads.The following table presents the pretax and after-tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss). 2013 2012Three months ended March 31, (in millions)Pretax Tax effect After-tax Pretax Tax effect After-taxUnrealized gains/(losses) on AFS securities:           Net unrealized gains/(losses) arising during the period$(515) $185 $(330) $3,118 $(1,217) $1,901Reclassification adjustment for realized (gains)/losses included in net income(a)(509) 199 (310) (536) 209 (327)Net change(1,024) 384 (640) 2,582 (1,008) 1,574Translation adjustments:           Translation(b)(427) 158 (269) 460 (169) 291Hedges(b)420 (164) 256 (267) 103 (164)Net change(7) (6) (13) 193 (66) 127Cash flow hedges:           Net unrealized gains/(losses) arising during the period(130) 51 (79) (41) 17 (24)Reclassification adjustment for realized (gains)/losses included in net income(c)29 (12) 17 (20) 9 (11)Net change(101) 39 (62) (61) 26 (35)Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans:           Net gains/(losses) arising during the period48 (10) 38 2 — 2Reclassification adjustments included in net income(d):           Amortization of net loss81 (31) 50 83 (32) 51Prior service costs/(credits)(11) 4 (7) (11) 4 (7)Foreign exchange and other37 (14) 23 (18) 7 (11)Net change155 (51) 104 56 (21) 35Total other comprehensive income/(loss)$(977) $366 $(611) $2,770 $(1,069) $1,701(a)The pretax amount is reported in securities gains in the Consolidated Statements of Income.(b)Reclassifications of pretax realized gains/(losses) on translation adjustments and related hedges are reported in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A.There are two categories of risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders’ equity, perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, subordinated long-term debt and other instruments qualifying as Tier 2 capital, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”). Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. RWA consist of on– and off–balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On–balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off–balance sheet assets, such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, and derivatives, are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on–balance sheet credit-equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on–balance sheet assets. RWA also incorporate a measure for the market risk related to applicable trading assets–debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total RWA.Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total capital to RWA, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. Banking subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.164The following table presents the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking subsidiaries at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. These amounts are determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and/or OCC. The table reflects the Firm’s and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s implementation, in the first quarter of 2013, of rules that provide for additional capital requirements for trading positions and securitizations (“Basel 2.5”). Implementation of Basel 2.5 resulted in an increase to the Firm’s RWA of approximately $150 billion, resulting in a decrease to the Firm’s Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 140 basis points and 160 basis points, respectively and an increase to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s RWA of approximately $140 billion, resulting in a decrease to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 130 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. Implementation of Basel 2.5 in the first quarter of 2013 did not impact Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s RWA or Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios.

There is no Tier 1 leverage component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company.(g)The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio for bank holding companies and banks is 3% or 4%, depending on factors specified in regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and OCC.Note:Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both nontaxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from nontaxable business combinations totaling $267 million and $291 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.165A reconciliation of the Firm’s Total stockholders’ equity to Tier 1 capital and Total qualifying capital is presented in the table below.(in millions) March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 capital    Total stockholders’ equity $207,086 $204,069Effect of certain items in AOCI excluded from Tier 1 capital (3,600) (4,198)Qualifying hybrid securities and noncontrolling interests(a) 10,607 10,608Less: Goodwill(b) 45,482 45,663Other intangible assets(b) 2,233 2,311Fair value DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities related to the Firm’s credit quality 1,653 1,577Investments in certain subsidiaries 918 926Total Tier 1 capital 163,807 160,002Tier 2 capital    Long-term debt and other instruments qualifying as Tier 2 17,433 18,061Qualifying allowance for credit losses 17,698 15,995Other (12) (22)Total Tier 2 capital 35,119 34,034Total qualifying capital $198,926 $194,036(a)Primarily includes trust preferred capital debt securities of certain business trusts.(b)Goodwill and other intangible assets are net of any associated deferred tax liabilities. Note 21 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 308–315 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.To provide for the risk of loss inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale contracts, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on page 150 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. The amounts in the table below for lending-related commitments represent the total available credit, inclusive of certain non-legally binding lines of credit. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these non-legally binding lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. Also, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due.166Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments  Contractual amount Carrying value(g) Mar 31, 2013Dec 31, 2012 Mar 31, 2013Dec 31, 2012By remaining maturity (in millions)Expires in 1 year or lessExpires after 1 year through 3 yearsExpires after 3 years through 5 yearsExpires after 5 yearsTotalTotal   Lending-related         Consumer, excluding credit card:         Home equity – senior lien$2,240$4,911$4,820$2,804$14,775$15,180 $—$—Home equity – junior lien3,8767,9336,1102,97320,89221,796 ——Prime mortgage5,760———5,7604,107 ——Subprime mortgage—————— ——Auto7,317137154457,6537,185 11Business banking10,00958310035611,04811,092 66Student and other1081587473746796 ——Total consumer, excluding credit card29,31013,72211,1916,65160,87460,156 77Credit card537,455———537,455533,018 ——Total consumer566,76513,72211,1916,651598,329593,174 77Wholesale:         Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(a)(b)57,17379,70496,7246,087239,688243,225 431377Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(a)(b)(c)27,22931,51337,7981,65998,199100,929 638647Unused advised lines of credit78,93211,30479242191,44985,087 ——Other letters of credit(a)4,1761,407309535,9455,573 22Total wholesale167,510123,928135,6238,220435,281434,814 1,0711,026Total lending-related$734,275$137,650$146,814$14,871$1,033,610$1,027,988 $1,078$1,033Other guarantees and commitments         Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(d)$182,526$—$—$—$182,526$166,493 NANADerivatives qualifying as guarantees2,2171,41918,45237,17159,25961,738 $64$42Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements(e)52,209———52,20934,871 ——Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:         Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NANANA 2,6742,811Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA9,0229,305 139141Other guarantees and commitments(f)5483451,4314,3226,6466,780 (73)(75)(a)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, reflects the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $428 million and $473 million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $16.6 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $1.1 billion and $690 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.(b)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, included credit enhancements and bond and commercial paper liquidity commitments to U.S. states and municipalities, hospitals and other non profit entities of $43.2 billion and $44.5 billion, respectively. These commitments also include liquidity facilities to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs; for further information, see Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q.(c)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, included unissued standby letters of credit commitments of $42.2 billion and $44.4 billion, respectively.(d)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $183.2 billion and $165.1 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral comprises primarily cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies.(e)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the amount of commitments related to forward-starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements were $10.5 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements with regular-way settlement periods were $41.7 billion and $21.7 billion, at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.(f)At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, included unfunded commitments of $323 million and $370 million, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, to other equity investments. These commitments included $236 million and $333 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3 on pages 96–107 of this Form 10-Q. In addition, at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.(g)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value.167Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged and acquisition finance activities, which were $7.3 billion and $8.8 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 96–107 and 107–108 respectively, of this Form 10-Q.In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as clearing and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, the tri-party repurchase daily balances averaged $362 billion.GuaranteesThe Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP:  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 308–315 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $640 million and $649 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $278 million and $284 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $362 million and $365 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions)Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesOther letters of credit Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesOther letters of creditInvestment-grade(a) $74,534 $4,181  $77,081 $3,998Noninvestment-grade(a) 23,665 1,764  23,848 1,575Total contractual amount $98,199 $5,945  $100,929 $5,573Allowance for lending-related commitments $276 $2  $282 $2Commitments with collateral 41,757 887  42,654 1,145(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 on pages 308–315 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $59.3 billion and $61.7 billion at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value  contracts was $26.6 billion and $26.5 billion and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.8 billion at both March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $138 million and $122 million and derivative receivables of $74 million and $80 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser 168and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5 on pages 118–119 of this Form 10-Q.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsMortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm’s loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs and other loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, as described in Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 on pages 280–291 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense.There have been generalized allegations, as well as specific demands, that the Firm repurchase loans sold or deposited into private-label securitizations (including claims from insurers that have guaranteed certain obligations of the securitization trusts). Although the Firm encourages parties to use the contractual repurchase process established in the governing agreements, these private-label repurchase claims have generally manifested themselves through threatened or pending litigation. Accordingly, the liability related to repurchase demands associated with all of the private-label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 on pages 170–179 of this Form 10-Q and Note 31 on pages 316–325 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.The Firm has recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, as March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, which is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities net of probable recoveries from third-party originators of $412 million and $441 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. The Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability is intended to cover losses associated with all loans previously sold in connection with loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs, regardless of when those losses occur or how they are ultimately resolved (e.g., repurchase, make-whole payment). The liability related to all repurchase demands associated with private-label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firm’s established methodology for computing its recorded mortgage repurchase liability — including factors such as the amount of probable future demands from the GSEs (based on both historical  experience and the Firm’s expectations about the GSEs future behavior), the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, and recoveries from third parties — require application of a significant level of management judgment.While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its mortgage repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued as of March 31, 2013, are reasonably possible. The Firm believes the estimate of the range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of its established repurchase liability, is from $0 to approximately $0.9 billion at March 31, 2013. This estimated range of reasonably possible loss considers the Firm’s GSE-related exposure based on an assumed peak to trough decline in home prices of 37%, which is an additional 8 percentage point decline in home prices beyond the Firm’s current assumptions derived from a nationally recognized home price index. Although the Firm does not consider a further decline in home prices of this magnitude likely to occur, such a decline could increase the levels of loan delinquencies, which may, in turn, increase the level of repurchase demands from the GSEs and potentially result in additional repurchases of loans at greater loss severities and thereby the Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability.The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability(a) Three months ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Repurchase liability at beginning of period$2,811 $3,557Net realized losses(b)(212) (364)Provision for repurchase losses(c)75 323Repurchase liability at end of period$2,674 $3,516(a)All mortgage repurchase demands associated with private-label securitizations are separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.(b)Realized repurchase losses are presented net of third-party recoveries and include principal losses and accrued interest on repurchased loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expense. Make-whole settlements were $121 million and $186 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(c)Included $8 million and $27 million of provision related to new loan sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Loans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when 169foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $9.0 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $139 million and $141 million at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively.Note 22 – Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, see Note 30 on pages 315–316 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Pledged assetsAt March 31, 2013, assets were pledged to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, at March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had pledged $299.0 billion and $291.7 billion, respectively, of financial instruments it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 on pages 151–158 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 on pages 280–291 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report, for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs.CollateralAt March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had accepted assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $695.9 billion and $757.1 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $552.8 billion and $545.0 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. The total amount of collateral received and collateral sold or repledged at December 31, 2012, has been revised. This revision had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets or its results of operations. Note 23 – LitigationContingenciesAs of March 31, 2013, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $6.0 billion at March 31, 2013. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm’s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.Auction-Rate Securities Investigations and Litigation. Beginning in March 2008, several regulatory authorities initiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerning possible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities (“ARS”). The market for many such securities had frozen and a significant number of auctions for those securities began to fail in February 2008.The Firm, on behalf of itself and affiliates, agreed to a settlement in principle with the New York Attorney General’s Office which provided, among other things, that the Firm would offer to purchase at par certain ARS purchased from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Chase Investment Services Corp. and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. by individual investors, charities and small- to medium-sized businesses. The Firm also agreed to a substantively similar 170settlement in principle with the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida and the North American Securities Administrators Association (“NASAA”) Task Force, which agreed to recommend approval of the settlement to all remaining states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Firm has finalized the settlement agreements with the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida. The settlement agreements provide for the payment of penalties totaling $25 million to all states and territories. To date, final consent agreements have been reached with all but three of NASAA’s members.The Firm also was named in two putative antitrust class actions. The actions alleged that the Firm, along with numerous other financial institution defendants, colluded to maintain and stabilize the ARS market and then to withdraw their support for the ARS market. In January 2010, the District Court dismissed both actions. In March 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the cases with prejudice.Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering. In January 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co. entered into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. entered into a Consent Order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) relating principally to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s and such banks’ policies, procedures and controls relating to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering requirements. The Firm neither admitted nor denied the regulatory agencies’ findings in the orders.Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters. The Bear Stearns Companies LLC (formerly The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.)(“Bear Stearns”), certain current or former subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, including Bear Stearns Asset Management, Inc. (“BSAM”) and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., and certain individuals formerly employed by Bear Stearns are named defendants (collectively the “Bear Stearns defendants”) in multiple civil actions and arbitrations relating to alleged losses resulting from the failure of the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the “High Grade Fund”) and the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the “Enhanced Leverage Fund”) (collectively the “Funds”). BSAM served as investment manager for both of the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands “feeder funds” that invested substantially all their assets, directly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are in liquidation.There are currently three civil actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Funds. One of these actions involves a derivative lawsuit brought on behalf of purchasers of partnership interests in the U.S. feeder fund to the Enhanced Leverage Fund, alleging that the Bear Stearns defendants mismanaged the Funds. This action seeks,  among other things, unspecified compensatory damages based on alleged investor losses. The parties have reached an agreement to settle this derivative action, pursuant to which BSAM would pay a maximum of approximately $18 million. In April 2012, the District Court granted final approval of this settlement. In May 2012, objectors representing certain interests in the U.S. feeder fund filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the District Court’s final approval of the settlement. The parties have agreed to settle that appeal.The second pending action, brought by the Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feeder funds, makes allegations similar to those asserted in the derivative lawsuits related to the U.S. feeder funds. This action alleges net losses of approximately $700 million and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to resolve the litigation contingent on the execution of a written settlement agreement. The third action was brought by Bank of America and Banc of America Securities LLC (together “BofA”) alleging breach of contract, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with a $4 billion securitization in May 2007 known as a “CDO-squared,” for which BSAM served as collateral manager. This securitization was composed of certain collateralized debt obligation holdings that were purchased by BofA from the Funds. BofA currently seeks damages up to approximately $540 million. Motions for summary judgment are pending.Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters. Various shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Bear Stearns between December 14, 2006, and March 14, 2008 (the “Class Period”). The actions alleged that the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding Bear Stearns’ business and financial results and that, as a result of those false statements, Bear Stearns’ common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. In November 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval of a $275 million settlement. Certain investors have elected not to participate in the class settlement, and therefore may proceed separately with individual actions or arbitrations.Bear Stearns, former members of Bear Stearns’ Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns’ former executive officers have also been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative and class action suit which is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securities laws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, and indemnification and contribution in connection with the losses sustained by Bear Stearns as a result of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common stock. Certain 171individual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of Bear Stearns common stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount. The District Court dismissed the action in January 2011, and plaintiffs have appealed.CIO Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to a consolidated shareholder class action, a consolidated class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), shareholder derivative actions, shareholder demands and government investigations relating to losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). The Firm has received requests for documents and information in connection with governmental inquiries and investigations by Congress, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the UK Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), the State of Massachusetts and other government agencies. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations.Four putative class actions alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Firm’s common stock. The cases were consolidated and lead plaintiffs were appointed pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The consolidated second amended complaint defines the putative class as purchasers of the Firm’s common stock between February 24, 2010 and May 21, 2012, and alleges that the Firm and certain current and former officers made false or misleading statements concerning CIO’s role, the Firm’s risk management practices and the Firm’s financial results, as well as in connection with the disclosure of losses in the synthetic credit portfolio in 2012. Separately, two putative class actions were filed on behalf of participants who held the Firm’s common stock in the Firm’s retirement plans. These actions have been consolidated, and the consolidated third amended complaint alleges a class period of December 20, 2011 to July 12, 2012, and asserts claims under ERISA solely on behalf of participants in the Firm’s 401(k) Savings Plan for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the Firm, certain affiliates and certain current and former directors and officers. The complaint generally alleges that defendants breached the duty of prudence by allowing investment in the Firm's common stock when they knew or should have known that such stock was unsuitable for the plan and that the Firm and certain current and former officers made false or misleading statements concerning the Firm's financial condition. Nine shareholder derivative actions have also been filed, purportedly on behalf of the Firm, against certain of the Firm’s current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. These actions generally allege that defendants failed to exercise adequate oversight  over CIO and to manage the risk of CIO’s activities, which allegedly led to CIO’s losses. Two of these actions have been consolidated. The consolidated securities action, the consolidated ERISA action, the consolidated shareholder derivative action and one of the derivative actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the other six derivative actions are pending in New York State court. In April 2013, a New York State court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss one of the shareholder derivative actions on the ground that plaintiff failed to make a demand on the Firm’s Board of Directors or adequately allege demand futility, as required by applicable Delaware law. Defendants have not yet responded to the complaints in any of the other actions.In January 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co. entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Consent Order with the OCC arising out of the Federal Reserve’s and the OCC’s reviews of the CIO, including the synthetic credit portfolio previously held by the CIO. The Consent Orders relate to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm. Many of the actions required by the Consent Orders have already been, or are in the process of being, implemented by the Firm.City of Milan Litigation and Criminal Investigation. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the “City”) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (together, “JPMorgan Chase”) in the District Court of Milan. The proceedings relate to (a) a bond issue by the City in June 2005 (the “Bond”), and (b) an associated swap transaction, which was subsequently restructured on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2007 (the “Swap”). The City seeks damages and/or other remedies against JPMorgan Chase (among others) on the grounds of alleged “fraudulent and deceitful acts” and alleged breach of advisory obligations in connection with the Swap and the Bond, together with related swap transactions with other counterparties. The Firm has entered into a settlement agreement with the City to resolve the City’s civil proceedings.In March 2010, a criminal judge directed four current and former JPMorgan Chase personnel and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) to go forward to a full trial that started in May 2010. As it relates to JPMorgan Chase individuals, two were acquitted and two were found guilty of aggravated fraud with sanctions of prison sentences, fines and a ban from dealing with Italian public bodies for one year. JPMorgan Chase (along with other banks involved) was found liable for breaches of Italian administrative law, fined €1 million and ordered to forfeit profit from the transaction (for JPMorgan Chase, totaling €24.7 million). JPMorgan Chase and the individuals have appealed the verdict, and none of the sanctions will take effect until all appeal avenues have been exhausted.172Enron Litigation. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in two lawsuits seeking damages arising out of the Firm’s banking relationships with Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (“Enron”). Motions to dismiss are pending in both of these lawsuits: an individual action by Enron investors and an action by an Enron counterparty. A number of actions and other proceedings against the Firm previously were resolved, including a class action lawsuit captioned Newby v. Enron Corp. and adversary proceedings brought by Enron’s bankruptcy estate.FERC Matters. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) is investigating the Firm’s bidding practices in certain organized power markets. In March 2013, the Firm received a Wells-type notice that the FERC staff intends to recommend that the Commission bring a possible enforcement action against J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. (“JPMVEC”), JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain Firm personnel relating to alleged violations of FERC rules and the rules of certain independent system operators. Additionally, in November 2012, the FERC issued an Order suspending JPMVEC’s market-based rate authority for six months commencing on April 1, 2013, based on its finding that statements concerning discovery obligations made in submissions related to the FERC investigation violated FERC rules regarding misleading information.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of putative class action complaints relating to interchange in several federal courts. The complaints allege, among other claims, that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain other banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. All cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings.In October 2012, Visa, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated and various United States financial institution defendants, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Chase Bank USA, N.A., Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC and certain predecessor institutions, entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) to resolve the claims of the U.S. merchant and retail association plaintiffs (the “Class Plaintiffs”) in the multi-district litigation. In November 2012, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement Agreement, which provides for, among other things, a cash payment of $6.05 billion to the Class Plaintiffs (of which the Firm’s share is approximately 20%), and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. The Settlement Agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network’s rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. The rule modifications became effective in January 2013. In April 2013, Class Plaintiffs moved for  final approval of the settlement. The hearing on final approval is scheduled for September 2013.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending three pending cases that allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs claim that JPMorgan Investment Management is liable for losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. In the case filed by Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and the case filed by Ambac Assurance UK Limited in New York state court, discovery is proceeding on claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence. The third case, filed by CMMF LLP in New York state court, asserts claims under New York law for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Trial of the CMMF action was completed in February 2013, and the Court’s decision is pending.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Committee”) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $8.6 billion in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI’s bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s collateral requests hastened LBHI’s bankruptcy. The Firm moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint in its entirety, and also moved to transfer the litigation from the Bankruptcy Court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In April 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued a decision granting in part and denying in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint seeking avoidance of the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008. The Court denied the Firm’s motion to dismiss as to the other claims, including claims that allege intentional misconduct. In September 2012, the District Court denied the transfer motion without prejudice to its renewal in the future, but stated that any trial would likely have to be conducted before the District Court.The Firm also filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion in claims (the “Clearing Claims”) against the estate of Lehman Brothers Inc. (“LBI”), LBHI’s broker-dealer subsidiary. These claims have been paid in full, subject to the outcome of the litigation. Discovery is ongoing.173LBHI and the Committee have filed an objection to the deficiency claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to the Clearing Claims, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for such claims in a commercially reasonable manner. The Firm responded to LBHI’s objection in November 2011. Discovery is ongoing.LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors have filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm responded to this separate complaint and objection in February 2013. Discovery is ongoing.LIBOR Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, CFTC, SEC and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission, UK Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world. The documents and information sought relate primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class actions filed in various federal and state courts in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are impacted by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, or Euroyen TIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages.In 2011, a number of class actions were filed against LIBOR panel banks, including the Firm, asserting various federal and state law claims relating to the alleged manipulation of U.S. dollar LIBOR. These purported class actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where the Court has appointed interim lead counsel for three  proposed classes: (i) direct purchasers of U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments in the over-the-counter market; (ii) purchasers of U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments on an exchange; and (iii) purchasers of debt securities that pay an interest rate linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR. In March 2013, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims asserted in the three putative class actions, as well as in three related individual actions brought by various Charles Schwab entities. The Court dismissed with prejudice all plaintiffs' federal and state antitrust law, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act and New York unjust enrichment claims, as well as certain claims under the Commodities Exchange Act (the "CEA"). The Court declined to dismiss certain other CEA claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over certain state and common law claims. All of the actions pending before this Court that were not the subject of the defendants’ motion to dismiss have been stayed.Since April 2012, a number of additional U.S. dollar LIBOR putative class actions and individual actions have been filed in various courts. Defendants have moved to transfer each of these cases to the consolidated action pending in the Southern District of New York. To date, all but two of these actions have been transferred. The first is an individual action asserting federal and New York State antitrust law claims and RICO claims, based upon the defendant banks’ alleged upward manipulation of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The defendants’ response to the complaint is due in June 2013. The second case is an individual action brought by Freddie Mac in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking damages for antitrust violations and fraud for alleged U.S. dollar LIBOR manipulation.In August 2012, a shareholder derivative action was filed in New York state court, purportedly on behalf of the Firm, against certain of the Firm’s current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties in connection with the alleged manipulation of LIBOR. In April 2013, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the action.The Firm also has been named as a defendant in a purported class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which seeks to bring claims on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased or sold exchange-traded Euroyen futures and options contracts. In April 2013, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. Defendants’ response to that pleading is due in June 2013.Madoff Litigation. JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by the trustee (the “Trustee”) for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“Madoff”). The Trustee has served an amended complaint in which he has asserted 28 causes of action against JPMorgan Chase, 20 of which seek to avoid certain transfers (direct or indirect) made to JPMorgan Chase that are alleged to have been preferential or fraudulent under the federal 174Bankruptcy Code and the New York Debtor and Creditor Law. The remaining causes of action involve claims for, among other things, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, contribution and unjust enrichment in connection with Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. The complaint asserts common law claims that purport to seek approximately $19 billion in damages, together with bankruptcy law claims to recover approximately $425 million in transfers that JPMorgan Chase allegedly received directly or indirectly from Bernard Madoff’s brokerage firm. In October 2011, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted JPMorgan Chase’s motion to dismiss the common law claims asserted by the Trustee, and returned the remaining claims to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings. The Trustee appealed this decision and oral argument on the appeal was held in November 2012. The Firm is awaiting the Court’s decision.Separately, J.P. Morgan Trust Company (Cayman) Limited, JPMorgan (Suisse) SA, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Bear Stearns Alternative Assets International Ltd., J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp., J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA, and J.P. Morgan Markets Limited (formerly Bear Stearns International Limited) were named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, “Fairfield”), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions are based on theories of mistake and restitution, among other theories, and seek to recover payments made to defendants by the funds totaling approximately $155 million. Pursuant to an agreement with the Trustee, the liquidators of Fairfield have voluntarily dismissed their action against J.P. Morgan Securities plc without prejudice to refiling. The other actions remain outstanding. In addition, a purported class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc to an already pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The Court dismissed these complaints and plaintiffs have appealed. Oral argument on the appeal was held in April 2013 and the Firm is awaiting the Court’s decision.The Firm is a defendant in five other Madoff-related actions pending in New York state court and one purported class action in federal District Court in New York. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The Firm has moved to dismiss both the state and federal actions. The Firm is also responding to various governmental investigations relating to Madoff, including by the Department of Justice and other regulators.MF Global. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was named as one of several defendants in a number of putative class action lawsuits brought by former customers of MF Global in federal District Courts in New York, Illinois and Montana. The lawsuits were consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The actions alleged, among other things, that the Firm aided and abetted MF Global’s alleged misuse of customer money and breaches of fiduciary duty and was unjustly enriched by the transfer of certain customer segregated funds by MF Global.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one of several defendants in a number of purported class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global’s publicly traded securities, including the securities issued pursuant to MF Global’s June 2010 secondary offering of common stock and February 2011 and August 2011 convertible note offerings. The actions have been consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In August 2012, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which asserts violations of the Securities Act of 1933 against the underwriter defendants and alleges that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global’s financial position, internal controls and risk management, as such topics relate to its exposure to European sovereign debt. Defendants moved to dismiss in October 2012. Those motions remain pending.In June 2012, the Securities Investor Protection Act (“SIPA”) Trustee issued a Report of the Trustee’s Investigation and Recommendations, and stated that he was considering potential claims against the Firm with respect to certain transfers identified in the Report.In March 2013, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement with the customer class plaintiffs and the SIPA Trustee, pursuant to which the Firm has agreed to pay a total of $107.5 million to resolve all claims that have been or could be asserted by the customer class and the SIPA Trustee against the Firm and any of its affiliates or employees. In addition, under the proposed settlement, the Firm has agreed to release certain liens and set-off rights it had retained in certain MF Global proprietary funds that were previously remitted to the SIPA Trustee, and to remit certain additional MF Global proprietary funds that the Firm held to secure potential obligations under certain agreements with MF Global and its U.K. affiliate. The settlement remains subject to approval by both the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court. A joint hearing to consider approval of the settlement by those Courts has been set for July 2013.The Firm is also continuing to respond to inquiries from the CFTC, SEC and Bankruptcy Trustee concerning MF Global.175Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Mortgage-Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates, Bear Stearns and affiliates and Washington Mutual affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles as issuer, originator or underwriter in MBS offerings. These cases include purported class action suits, actions by individual purchasers of securities or by trustees for the benefit of purchasers of securities, an action by the New York State Attorney General and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of securities offerings. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the offering documents for securities issued by numerous securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including with regard to the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination. There are currently pending and tolled investor claims involving approximately $170 billion of such securities. In addition, and as described below, there are pending and threatened claims by monoline insurers and by and on behalf of trustees that involve some of these and other securitizations.In the actions against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter of its own MBS offerings), three purported class actions are pending against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, and/or certain of their affiliates and current and former employees, in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Motions to dismiss have been largely denied in these cases, although in certain cases defendants have sought to appeal aspects of the decision, and they are in various stages of litigation.In addition to class actions, the Firm is also a defendant in individual actions brought against certain affiliates of JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as issuers (and, in some cases, as underwriters) of MBS. These actions involve claims by or to benefit various institutional investors and governmental agencies. These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the United States and are in various stages of litigation.In actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now defunct, such as in a pending case where the Firm has been named involving affiliates of IndyMac Bancorp. A settlement of a purported class action involving Thornburg Mortgage MBS offerings that was pending against the Firm has received final court approval. The Firm may also be contractually obligated to indemnify underwriters in certain deals it issued. EMC Mortgage LLC (formerly EMC Mortgage Corporation) (“EMC”), an indirect subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and certain other JPMorgan Chase entities currently are defendants in nine pending actions commenced by bond insurers that guaranteed payments of principal and interest on certain classes of 19 different MBS offerings. These actions are pending in federal and state courts in New York and are in various stages of litigation. Certain JPMorgan Chase entities, in their capacities as alleged successors in interest to Bear Stearns and EMC, have been named as defendants in a civil suit filed by the New York State Attorney General in New York state court in connection with Bear Stearns’ due diligence and quality control practices relating to MBS.The Firm or its affiliates are defendants in actions brought by trustees or master servicers of various MBS trusts and others on behalf of the purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. The first action was commenced by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, against the Firm and the FDIC based on MBS issued by Washington Mutual Bank and its affiliates; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. The other actions are at various initial stages of litigation in the New York and Delaware state courts, including actions brought by MBS trustees, each specific to one or more MBS transactions, against EMC and/or JPMorgan Chase. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans, as well as indemnification of attorneys’ fees and costs and other remedies.There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation, and the Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased such securities that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims. In addition, the Firm has received several demands by securitization trustees that threaten litigation, as well as demands by investors directing or threatening to direct trustees to investigate claims or bring litigation, based on purported obligations to repurchase loans out of securitization trusts and alleged servicing deficiencies. These include but are not limited to a demand from a law firm, as counsel to a group of purchasers of MBS that purport to have 25% or more of the voting rights in as many as 191 different trusts sponsored by the Firm or its affiliates with an original principal balance of more than $174 billion (excluding 52 trusts sponsored by Washington Mutual, with an original principal balance of more than $58 billion), made to various trustees to investigate potential repurchase and servicing claims. Further, there have been repurchase and servicing claims made in litigation against trustees not affiliated with the Firm, but involving trusts that the Firm sponsored.176In April 2012, the New York state court granted the Firm’s motion to dismiss a shareholder complaint against the Firm and two affiliates, members of the boards of directors thereof and certain employees, asserting claims based on alleged wrongful actions and inactions relating to residential mortgage originations and securitizations. In February 2013, the court’s order was affirmed on appeal, and plaintiff thereafter filed a motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. A second shareholder complaint has been filed in New York state court against current and former members of the Firm’s Board of Directors and the Firm, as nominal defendant, alleging that the Board allowed the Firm to engage in wrongful conduct regarding the sale of residential MBS and failed to implement adequate internal controls to prevent such wrongdoing.In addition to the above-described litigation, the Firm has also received, and responded to, a number of subpoenas and informal requests for information from federal and state authorities concerning mortgage-related matters, including inquiries concerning a number of transactions involving the Firm and its affiliates’ origination and purchase of whole loans, underwriting, issuance and trading of MBS, treatment of early payment defaults, potential breaches of securitization representations and warranties, reserves and due diligence in connection with securitizations. The Firm continues to respond to other MBS-related regulatory inquiries.Mortgage Foreclosure-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorneys General of Massachusetts and New York have separately filed lawsuits against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry’s electronic mortgage registry. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the Massachusetts action and the Firm has moved to dismiss the New York action.The Firm is named as a defendant in three purported class action lawsuits relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. Two of the actions are in the discovery phase and in the remaining action, the court granted in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss, and denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.Two shareholder derivative actions have been filed in New York Supreme Court against the Firm’s Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. These actions seek declaratory relief and damages. In July 2012, the Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the first-filed action and gave plaintiff 45 days in which to file an amended complaint. In October 2012, the Court entered a stipulated order consolidating the actions and staying all proceedings pending the plaintiffs’ decision whether to file a consolidated complaint after the Firm completes its response to a demand submitted by one of the plaintiffs under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm’s compliance with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration’s Direct Endorsement Program. The Firm is cooperating in that investigation.On January 7, 2013, the Firm announced that it and a number of other financial institutions entered into a settlement agreement with the OCC and the Federal Reserve providing for the termination of the Independent Foreclosure Review programs that had been required under the Consent Orders with such banking regulators relating to each bank’s residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. Under this settlement, the Firm will make a cash payment of approximately $750 million into a settlement fund for distribution to qualified borrowers. The Firm has also committed an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure prevention actions under the settlement, which will be fulfilled through credits given to the Firm for modifications, short sales and other types of borrower relief.Municipal Derivatives Investigations and Litigation. Purported class action lawsuits and individual actions were filed against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, as well as numerous other providers and brokers, alleging antitrust violations in the market for financial instruments related to municipal bond offerings referred to collectively as “municipal derivatives.” In July 2011, the Firm settled with federal and state governmental agencies to resolve their investigations into similar alleged conduct. The municipal derivatives actions were consolidated and/or coordinated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In December 2012, the District Court granted final approval of a settlement with the Firm calling for payment by the Firm of approximately $43 million. Certain class members opted out of the settlement, including 27 plaintiffs named in individual actions already pending against JPMorgan.In addition, civil actions have been commenced against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. In November 2009, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC settled with the SEC to resolve its investigation into those transactions. Following that settlement, the County filed an action against the Firm and several other defendants in Alabama state court. An action on behalf of a purported class of sewer rate payers has also been filed in Alabama state court. The suits allege that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The complaints also allege that the Firm concealed these third-party payments and that, but for this concealment, the County would not have entered into the transactions. The Court denied the Firm’s motions to dismiss the complaints in both proceedings. In November and December 2011, the County filed notices of bankruptcy with the trial court in each of the cases and with the Alabama Supreme Court stating that it was a Chapter 9 177Debtor in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Subsequently, the portion of the sewer rate payer action involving claims against the Firm was removed by certain defendants to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In its order finding that removal of this action was proper, the District Court referred the action to the District’s Bankruptcy Court, where the action remains pending. Limited discovery has taken place in the County’s action and additional discovery may take place in 2013.In September 2012, another group of sewer ratepayers from the County initiated an adversary proceeding and filed a purported class action complaint alleging that certain warrants were issued unlawfully and were thus null and void and seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the Firm and other defendants involved in the Jefferson County financing transactions. The Firm, along with a number of other defendants, moved to dismiss the complaint in November 2012. Plaintiffs subsequently agreed to dismiss their tort claims seeking damages and are solely pursuing their claims relating to the validity of the warrants. At a hearing on the motions to dismiss, the Bankruptcy Court gave the plaintiffs leave to replead their claims. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in April 2013, which names only Jefferson County and the indenture trustee as defendants and does not name the Firm as a defendant, and thus no longer seeks affirmative damages from the Firm. Plaintiffs do still seek a declaration that certain warrants are null and void. Motions to dismiss the second amended complaint were filed in April 2013, and remain pending.Two insurance companies that guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on warrants issued by the County have filed separate actions against the Firm in New York state court. Their complaints assert that the Firm fraudulently misled them into issuing insurance based upon substantially the same alleged conduct described above and other alleged non-disclosures. One insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of nearly $1.2 billion and seeks unspecified damages in excess of $400 million as well as unspecified punitive damages. The other insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of more than $378 million and seeks recovery of $4 million allegedly paid under the policies to date as well as any future payments and unspecified punitive damages. In December 2010, the court denied the Firm’s motions to dismiss each of the complaints. The Firm filed a cross-claim and a third party claim against the County for indemnity and contribution. The County moved to dismiss, which the court denied in August 2011. In consequence of its November 2011 bankruptcy filing, the County has asserted that these actions are stayed. In February 2012, one of the insurers filed a motion for a declaration that its action is not stayed as against the Firm or, in the alternative, for an order lifting the stay as against the Firm. In April 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied the insurer’s motion and ruled that the insurer’s action is stayed against the Firm and that cause does not exist to lift the stay. Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage Litigation. The Firm is defending one purported and three certified class actions, all pending in federal courts in California, which assert that several JPMorgan Chase entities violated the federal Truth in Lending Act and state unfair business practice statutes in failing to provide adequate disclosures in Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage (“ARM”) loans regarding the resetting of introductory interest rates and that negative amortization was certain to occur if a borrower made the minimum monthly payment. With respect to the former Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns defendants who purchased Option ARM loans from third-party originators, plaintiffs allege that those entities aided and abetted the original lenders’ alleged violations. Classes have been certified in three of the actions. In two of the certified class actions, the Firm has moved for decertification of the class and for summary judgment.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid, on fraudulent transfer and preference grounds, certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees and the parties have agreed to stay the action brought by the Receiver until after the Bankruptcy Court rules on the pending motions.Securities Lending Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in a putative class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought by participants in the Firm’s securities lending business. The action relates to investments of approximately $500 million in Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Court granted the Firm’s motion to dismiss all claims in April 2012. The plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which the Firm also moved to dismiss. In March 2013, the Court denied the motion to dismiss and scheduled a trial to begin January 2014.178Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual, Inc. (“WMI”) subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities for alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. The District Court denied as premature motions by the Firm and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank’s claims. Discovery is underway.In addition, JPMorgan Chase was sued in an action originally filed in state court in Texas (the “Texas Action”) by certain holders of WMI common stock and debt of WMI and Washington Mutual Bank who seek unspecified damages alleging that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at a price that was allegedly too low. The Texas Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which ultimately granted JPMorgan Chase’s and the FDIC’s motions to dismiss the complaint, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court’s dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. Plaintiffs, who sue now only as holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt following their voluntary dismissal of claims brought as holders of WMI common stock and debt, have filed an amended complaint alleging that JPMorgan Chase caused the closure of Washington Mutual Bank and damaged them by causing their bonds issued by Washington Mutual Bank, which had a total face value of $38 million, to lose substantially all of their value. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs’ claim that the Firm tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs’ bond contracts with Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closure.* * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. During the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Firm incurred $0.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, of litigation expense. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.179Note 24 – Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. The business segment financial results presented reflect the current organization of JPMorgan Chase. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business Segment Results on page 15 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 78–79 and Note 33 on pages 326–329 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. Segment resultsThe following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).Effective January 1, 2013, the Firm further refined the capital allocation framework to align it with the revised line of business structure that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses is largely driven by the most current regulatory guidance on Basel III requirements (including the NPR), principally for CIB and CIO, and by anticipated business growth. 180Segment results and reconciliation(a)As of or for the three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios)Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset Management20132012 20132012 20132012 20132012Noninterest revenue$4,406$4,975 $7,357$6,488 $535$557 $2,094$1,887Net interest income7,2097,388 2,7832,850 1,1381,100 559483Total net revenue11,61512,363 10,1409,338 1,6731,657 2,6532,370Provision for credit losses549642 11(3) 3977 2119Noninterest expense6,7907,038 6,1116,211 644598 1,8761,729Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)4,2764,683 4,0183,130 990982 756622Income tax expense/(benefit)1,6901,747 1,4081,097 394391 269236Net income/(loss)$2,586$2,936 $2,610$2,033 $596$591 $487$386Average common equity$46,000$43,000 $56,500$47,500 $13,500$9,500 $9,000$7,000Total assets (period-end)458,902469,084 872,259879,691 184,689161,741 109,73496,385Return on common equity23%27% 19%17% 18%25% 22%22%Overhead ratio5857 6067 3836 7173As of or for the three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios)Corporate/Private Equity Reconciling Items(b) Total20132012 20132012 20132012Noninterest revenue$361$1,013 $(564)$(534) $14,189$14,386Net interest income(594)16 (162)(171) 10,93311,666Total net revenue(233)1,029 (726)(705) 25,12226,052Provision for credit losses(3)(9) —— 617726Noninterest expense22,769 —— 15,42318,345Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)(232)(1,731) (726)(705) 9,0826,981Income tax expense/(benefit)(482)(709) (726)(705) 2,5532,057Net income/(loss)$250$(1,022) $—$— $6,529$4,924Average common equity$69,733$70,711 $—$— $194,733$177,711Total assets763,765713,263 NANA 2,389,3492,320,164Return on average common equityNMNM NMNM 13%11%Overhead ratioNMNM NMNM 6170(a)Managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications as discussed below that do not have any impact on net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole.(b)Segment managed results reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 28, 2013, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2012, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.May 8, 2013PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017182JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates(Taxable-equivalent interest and rates; in millions, except rates) Three months ended March 31, 2013 Three months ended March 31, 2012 AveragebalanceInterest(d) Rate(annualized) AveragebalanceInterest(d) Rate(annualized)Assets           Deposits with banks$156,988$163 0.42%  $110,817$152 0.55% Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements231,421514 0.90  230,444651 1.14 Securities borrowed(a)120,337(6) (0.02)  133,08037 0.11 Trading assets – debt instruments250,5022,297 3.72  228,3972,441 4.30 Securities368,6731,987 2.19(e)  369,2732,382 2.60(e) Loans725,1248,554 4.78  715,5539,139 5.14 Other assets(b)43,03980 0.75  33,94970 0.83 Total interest-earning assets1,896,08413,589 2.91  1,821,51314,872 3.28 Allowance for loan losses(21,860)     (27,574)    Cash and due from banks46,830     45,483    Trading assets – equity instruments120,192     126,938    Trading assets – derivative receivables74,918     90,446    Goodwill48,168     48,218    Other intangible assets:           Mortgage servicing rights8,146     7,231    Purchased credit card relationships268     568    Other intangibles1,894     2,569    Other assets147,390     143,484    Total assets$2,322,030     $2,258,876    Liabilities           Interest-bearing deposits$787,870$545 0.28%  $759,084$722 0.38% Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements250,827167 0.27  233,41588 0.15 Commercial paper53,08426 0.20  48,35919 0.15 Trading liabilities – debt, short-term and other liabilities(c)184,824327 0.72  199,588302 0.61 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs60,341134 0.90  65,360182 1.12 Long-term debt254,3261,295 2.06  255,2461,722 2.71 Total interest-bearing liabilities1,591,2722,494 0.64  1,561,0523,035 0.78 Noninterest-bearing deposits355,913     339,398    Trading liabilities – equity instruments13,203     14,060    Trading liabilities – derivative payables68,683     76,069    All other liabilities, including the allowance for lending-related commitments88,618     82,786    Total liabilities2,117,689     2,073,365    Stockholders’ equity           Preferred stock9,608     7,800    Common stockholders’ equity194,733     177,711    Total stockholders’ equity204,341     185,511    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$2,322,030     $2,258,876    Interest rate spread   2.27%     2.50% Net interest income and net yield on interest-earning assets $11,095 2.37%   $11,837 2.61% (a)Negative interest income and yield for the three months ended March 31, 2013, is a result of increased client-driven demand for certain securities combined with the impact of low interest rates; the offset of this matched book activity is reflected as lower net interest expense reported within trading liabilities - debt, short-term and other liabilities.(b)Includes margin loans.(c)Includes brokerage customer payables.(d)Interest includes the effect of related hedging derivatives.

Upon the occurrence of a credit event, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay by, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.Credit cycle: A period of time over which credit quality improves, deteriorates and then improves again (or vice versa). The duration of a credit cycle can vary from a couple of years to several years.CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e., Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security and is assigned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s. This system facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities. A similar system is used to identify non- U.S. securities (CUSIP International Numbering System).Exchange traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk provided by credit bureaus, typically produced from statistical models by Fair Isaac Corporation utilizing data collected by the credit bureaus. Forward points: Represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., “spot rate”) to determine the forward exchange rate.Group of Seven (“G7”) nations: Countries in the G7 are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.G7 government bonds: Bonds issued by the government of one of countries in the G7 nations.Headcount-related expense: Includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.Home equity - senior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JP Morgan Chase holds the first security interest on the property.Home equity - junior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JP Morgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens.Interchange income: A fee paid to a credit card issuer in the clearing and settlement of a sales or cash advance transaction.Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment system. “Investment grade” generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a “BBB-”/“Baa3” or better, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.LLC: Limited Liability Company.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Origination date LTV ratioThe LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all lien positions related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.184Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.Mortgage product types:Alt-AAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. SubprimeSubprime loans are loans to customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.NA: Data is not applicable or available for the periodpresented.Net charge-off rate: Represents net charge-offs (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningful.Over the counter derivatives (“OTC”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.Over the counter cleared derivatives (“OTC cleared”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.Portfolio activity: Describes changes to the risk profile of existing lending-related exposures and their impact on the allowance for credit losses from changes in customer profiles and inputs used to estimate the allowances.Pre-provision profit: Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instruments, private 185equity investments, and physical commodities used in market making and client-driven activities. In addition, Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specified risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives, including the synthetic credit portfolio.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.Real assets: Real assets include investments in productive assets such as agriculture, energy rights, mining and timber properties and exclude raw land to be developed for real estate purposes.Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the wholesale lines of business.Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”): Risk-weighted assets consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the estimated credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk-weighted assets. Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the related mortgage and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds.Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.Trade-date and settlement-date: For financial instruments, the date that an order to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire an instrument is executed in the market. The trade-date may differ from the settlement-date, which is the date on which the actual transfer of a financial instrument between two parties is executed. The amount of time that passes between the trade-date and the settlement-date differs depending on the financial instrument. For repurchases under the common equity repurchase program, except where the trade-date is specified, the amounts disclosed are presented on a settlement-date basis. In the Capital Management section on pages 42–47, of this Form 10-Q, and where otherwise specified, repurchases under the common equity repurchase program are presented on a trade-date basis because the trade-date is used to calculate the Firm’s regulatory capital.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America.U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations:Obligations of agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury.Value-at-risk (“VaR”): A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.Washington Mutual transaction: On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain of the assets of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual”) from the FDIC.186LINE OF BUSINESS METRICSCONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (“CCB”)Active mobile customers - Users of all mobile platforms, which include: SMS, mobile smartphone and tablet, who have been active in the past 90 days.Consumer & Business Banking (“CBB”)Description of selected business metrics within CBB:Client investment managed accounts - Assets actively managed by Chase Wealth Management on behalf of clients.

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis on pages 77–80 of this Form 10-Q and pages 163–169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report.Item 4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 186 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2013, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.189Part II Other InformationItem 1 Legal ProceedingsFor information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in the Firm’s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, see the discussion of the Firm’s material litigation in Note 23 on pages 170–179 of this Form 10-Q.Item 1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of certain risk factors affecting the Firm,see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 8–21 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012; and Forward-Looking Statements on page 89 of this Form 10-Q.Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
