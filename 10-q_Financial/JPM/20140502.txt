(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, see Note 24 on page 166 of this Form 10-Q.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.The unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “2013 Annual Report”).Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the balance sheet when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, see Note 1 on pages 189–191 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Consolidated statements of cash flowsDuring the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. For additional information regarding this transaction, see Note 11 on pages 113–116 of this 10-Q.85Note 2 – Business changes and developmentsBusiness events Regulatory UpdateComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2014 capital plan.Basel IIIEffective January 1, 2014, the Firm became subject to Basel III. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Firm and its banking subsidiaries were subject to the capital requirements of Basel I and Basel 2.5. For further information on CCAR and the implementation of Basel III, refer to Note 20 on page 154 of this Form 10-Q.Preferred stock issuancesOn January 22, 2014, the Firm issued $2.0 billion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock with an optional redemption date on or after February 1, 2024; dividends are payable semiannually at a fixed rate of 6.75% through February 2024, and thereafter at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.78%. On January 30, and February 6, 2014, the Firm issued a combined total of $925 million of Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred stock with an optional redemption date on or after March 1, 2019; dividends are payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 6.70%. Lastly, on March 10, 2014, the Firm issued $1.0 billion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock with an optional redemption date on or after April 30, 2024; dividends are payable semiannually at a fixed rate of 6.125% through April 2024, and thereafter at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.33%. For further information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 309 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Physical commodities businessesThe Firm continues to execute a business simplification agenda that will allow it to focus on core activities for its core clients and better manage its operational, regulatory, and litigation risks. On March 19, 2014, the Firm announced that it had agreed to sell certain of its physical commodities operations, including its physical oil, gas, power, warehousing facilities and energy transportation operations, to Mercuria Energy Group Limited for approximately $3.5 billion. The after-tax impact of this transaction is not expected to be material. The sale is subject to normal regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2014. The Firm remains fully committed to its traditional banking activities in the commodities markets, including financial derivatives and the trading of precious metals, which are not part of the physical commodities operations sale. Common stock dividend increase and common equity repurchasesOn March 26, 2014, the Firm announced, following the Federal Reserve Board’s release of the 2014 CCAR results, its Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share, effective the second quarter of 2014. The Firm’s dividends will be subject to the Board of Directors’ approval at the customary times those dividends are declared. The Board has also authorized a common equity repurchase program to repurchase $6.5 billion of common equity between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity-based compensation plans.

included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $77.1 billion and $91.5 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related.(b)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included within trading loans were $14.7 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $6.1 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $3.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.(c)Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, market 88approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, see Note 5 on pages 100–109 of this Form 10-Q. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.(d)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions) when the long and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”).(e)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Therefore, the balances reported in the fair value hierarchy table are gross of any counterparty netting adjustments. However, if the Firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivables and payables balances would be $6.5 billion and $7.6 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash collateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances.(f)Private equity instruments represent investments within the Corporate/Private Equity line of business. The cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(g)Includes investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds that do not have readily determinable fair values. The Firm uses net asset value per share when measuring the fair value of these investments. At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the fair values of these investments were $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.2 billion and $899 million, respectively, were classified in level 2, and $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in level 3.Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basisFor the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2, or from level 2 into level 3. Transfers from level 3 into level 2 were not significant during the three months ended March 31, 2014.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, certain highly rated collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), including $27.3 billion held in the Firm’s available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities portfolio and $1.3 billion held in the trading portfolio, were transferred from level 3 to level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency.All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.Level 3 valuationsFor further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 195–215 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input range does not reflect the level of input uncertainty, instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at March 31, 2014, the equity and interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range presented. In addition, the interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while equity volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range. The forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated within the lower end of the range presented.89Level 3 inputs(a) March 31, 2014 (in millions, except for ratios and basis points)     Product/InstrumentFair value Principal valuation techniqueUnobservable inputsRange of input valuesWeighted averageResidential mortgage-backed securities and loans$11,022 Discounted cash flowsYield2 %-22%7%   Prepayment speed0 %-15%7%    Conditional default rate0 %-100%26%    Loss severity0 %-100%21%Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(b)1,333 Discounted cash flowsYield4 %-30%10%   Conditional default rate0 %-100%11%    Loss severity0 %-40%30%Corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, and other(c)13,119 Discounted cash flowsCredit spread53 bps-350 bps163 bps   Yield1 %-46%10%5,131 Market comparablesPrice3-12294Net interest rate derivatives2,090 Option pricingInterest rate correlation(75)%-95%     Interest rate spread volatility0 %-60% Net credit derivatives(b)(c)244 Discounted cash flowsCredit correlation42 %-79% Net foreign exchange derivatives(1,282) Option pricingForeign exchange correlation48 %-75% Net equity derivatives(1,060) Option pricingEquity volatility15 %-60% Net commodity derivatives(58) Discounted cash flowsForward commodity price$20-$160per megawatt hourCollateralized loan obligations797 Discounted cash flowsCredit spread225 bps-525 bps237 bps    Prepayment speed20%20%    Conditional default rate2%2%    Loss severity40%40% 493 Market comparablesPrice0-11385Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)8,552 Discounted cash flowsRefer to Note 16 on pages 148–151 of this Form 10-Q.

The estimation of the fair value of structured notes is predominantly based on the derivative features embedded within the instruments. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.(f)The range has not been disclosed due to the wide range of possible values given the diverse nature of the underlying investments.90Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions see Note 3 on pages 195–215 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.91 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  Three months ended March 31, 2014(in millions)Fair value at January 1, 2014Total realized/unrealized

The revision had no impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheet or its results of operations.Level 3 analysis Consolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 2.7% of total Firm assets at March 31, 2014. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2013, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 95 of this Form 10-Q.Three months ended March 31, 2014 Level 3 assets were $63.2 billion at March 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of $6.1 billion from December 31, 2013, mainly due to the following:•$2.9 billion decrease in trading assets - debt and equity instruments, largely driven by net sales and maturities of corporate debt securities and maturities of trading loans;•$1.1 billion decrease in derivative receivables largely driven by a decrease in equity derivative receivables due to maturities;•$1.1 billion decrease in MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 16 on pages 148–151 of this Form 10-Q;•$1.1 billion decrease in private equity investments, driven by sales of investments.Gains and lossesThe following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated.

At March 31, 2014, $333 million and $3.5 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At March 31, 2013, $176 million and $811 million of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at March 31, 2014 and 2013. For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $3.8 billion of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $3.0 billion related to trade finance loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale during the first quarter of 2014 and subject to a lower of cost or fair value adjustment. These loans were classified as level 3, as they are valued based on the indicative pricing received from external investors, which ranged from a spread of 30 bps to 78 bps, with a weighted average of 60 bps. At March 31, 2014, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis also included $363 million related to residential real estate loans measured at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 18% to 64%, with a weighted average of 29%.The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $226 million and $299 million, respectively.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 on pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.95Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair valueThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 on pages 195–215 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see Valuation hierarchy on pages 197–215 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and pages 86–97 of this Note.(c)Carrying value includes unamortized original issue discount and other valuation adjustments.96The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm’s wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflected as the remaining contractual principal is the final principal payment at maturity.At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(89) million and $(99) million, respectively.

For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 on pages 220–233 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge  accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.Type of DerivativeUse of DerivativeDesignation and disclosureAffected segment or unit10-Q page referenceManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:   ◦ Interest rateHedge fixed rate assets and liabilitiesFair value hedgeCorporate/PE106◦ Interest rateHedge floating rate assets and liabilitiesCash flow hedgeCorporate/PE107◦ Foreign exchange Hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilitiesFair value hedgeCorporate/PE106◦ Foreign exchange Hedge forecasted revenue and expenseCash flow hedgeCorporate/PE107◦ Foreign exchange Hedge the value of the Firm’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiariesNet investment hedgeCorporate/PE107◦ Commodity Hedge commodity inventoryFair value hedgeCIB106Manage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:   ◦ Interest rateManage the risk of the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRsSpecified risk managementCCB108◦ CreditManage the credit risk of wholesale lending exposuresSpecified risk managementCIB108◦ CommodityManage the risk of certain commodities-related contracts and investmentsSpecified risk managementCIB108◦ Interest rate and foreign exchangeManage the risk of certain other specified assets and liabilitiesSpecified risk managementCorporate/PE108Market-making derivatives and other activities:   ◦ VariousMarket-making and related risk managementMarket-making and otherCIB108◦ VariousOther derivativesMarket-making and otherCIB, Corporate/PE108100Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

Derivative receivables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative payables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the receivables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting against related derivative payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.

These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is comprised of  non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained. The following tables present information regarding certain financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the derivative instruments for which appropriate legal opinions have been obtained; excluded are (i) additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and (ii) all collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.

OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers(in millions)March 31, 2014December 31, 2013Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables$23,242$24,631Collateral posted18,94720,346105The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives      March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013(in millions)Single-notch downgradeTwo-notch downgrade Single-notch downgradeTwo-notch downgradeAmount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a)$1,017$3,018 $952$3,244Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b)522867 540876(a)Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.(b)Amounts represent fair value of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of IncomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. The current presentation excludes accrued interest.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to changes in foreign currency rates, were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.(c)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(d)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time values.        106Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.(c)The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.(d)Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $39 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) at March 31, 2014, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2014, and 2013. Gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) 2014 2013Three months ended March 31,(in millions)Excluded components recorded directly in income(a)Effective portion recorded in OCI Excluded components recorded directly in income(a)Effective portion recorded in OCIForeign exchange derivatives $(105) $(154)  $(77) $420(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three months ended March 31, 2014, and 2013.                      107Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.(b)Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.(c)Primarily relates to commodity derivatives used to mitigate energy price risk associated with energy-related contracts and investments. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm’s market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 on page 110 of this Form 10-Q for information on principal transactions revenue. 108Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 on pages 220–233 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes Maximum payout/Notional amountMarch 31, 2014 (in millions)Protection soldProtection purchased with identical underlyings(b)Net protection (sold)/purchased(c)Other protection purchased(d)Credit derivatives     Credit default swaps$(2,578,437) $2,579,206$769$13,583Other credit derivatives(a)(104,117) 45,157(58,960)22,631Total credit derivatives(2,682,554) 2,624,363(58,191)36,214Credit-related notes(127) —(127)2,814Total$(2,682,681) $2,624,363$(58,318)$39,028       Maximum payout/Notional amountDecember 31, 2013 (in millions)Protection soldProtection purchased with identical underlyings(b)Net protection (sold)/purchased(c)Other protection purchased(d)Credit derivatives     Credit default swaps$(2,601,581) $2,610,198$8,617$8,722Other credit derivatives(a)(95,094) 45,921(49,173)24,192Total credit derivatives(2,696,675) 2,656,119(40,556)32,914Credit-related notes(130) —(130)2,720Total$(2,696,805) $2,656,119$(40,686)$35,634(a)Other credit derivatives predominantly consists of put options on fixed income portfolios.(b)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.(c)Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.(d)Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.The following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.Protection sold – credit derivatives and credit-related notes ratings(a)/maturity profile   March 31, 2014 (in millions)<1 year1–5 years>5 yearsTotal notional amountFair value of receivables(b)Fair value of payables(b)Net fair valueRisk rating of reference entity       Investment-grade$(336,033)$(1,480,441)$(159,267)$(1,975,741)$31,405$(5,176)$26,229Noninvestment-grade(139,458)(532,686)(34,796)(706,940)27,735(15,521)12,214Total$(475,491)$(2,013,127)$(194,063)$(2,682,681)$59,140$(20,697)$38,443December 31, 2013 (in millions)<1 year1–5 years>5 yearsTotal notional amountFair value of receivables(b)Fair value of payables(b)Net fair valueRisk rating of reference entity       Investment-grade$(365,660)$(1,486,394)$(130,597)$(1,982,651)$31,727$(5,629)$26,098Noninvestment-grade(140,540)(544,671)(28,943)(714,154)27,426(16,674)10,752Total$(506,200)$(2,031,065)$(159,540)$(2,696,805)$59,153$(22,303)$36,850(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.(b)Amounts are shown on a gross basis, before the benefit of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received by the Firm. 109Note 6 – Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm’s noninterest revenue, see Note 7 on pages 234–235 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.

See Note 19 on page 153 of this Form 10-Q for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three months periods ended March 31, 2014, and 2013.The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2014 at this time. For 2014 , the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm’s U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $37 million. The 2014 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $49 million and $2 million, respectively.Note 9 – Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note 10 on pages 247–248 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.

(b)Included FDIC-related expense of $293 million and $379 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.112Note 11 – SecuritiesSecurities are classified as AFS, held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or trading. Securities classified as trading are discussed in Note 3 on pages 86–97 of this Form 10-Q. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM investment securities (the “investment securities portfolio”) are held by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (“CIO”) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At both March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 on pages 249–254 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax unrealized  losses of $9 million on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect the Firm’s intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures under Basel III.Realized gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (“OTTI”) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.

The Firm did not recognize any OTTI losses for the three months ended March 31, 2013.Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2013, the credit loss component of credit-impaired securities was reduced by $3 million due to the sales of the securities. The Firm did not experience any changes to the credit loss component of credit-impaired securities during the three months ended March 31, 2014.Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally decreased since December 31, 2013. Though losses on securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have increased, the increase is not material. The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of March 31, 2014, the Firm does not intend to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities noted above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities in an unrealized loss position are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2014.      115Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March 31, 2014, of JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.By remaining maturityMarch 31, 2014(in millions)Due in one year or lessDue after one year through five yearsDue after five years through 10 yearsDue after 10 years(c)TotalAvailable-for-sale debt securities     Mortgage-backed securities(a)     Amortized cost$700$14,103$5,971$114,139$134,913Fair value70714,6396,055116,932138,333Average yield(b)2.31%2.09%2.87%2.93%2.83%U.S. Treasury and government agencies(a)     Amortized cost$9,759$7,495$1,443$929$19,626Fair value9,7747,5031,44998519,711Average yield(b)0.39%0.38%0.38%0.77%0.40%Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities     Amortized cost$51$426$1,311$23,497$25,285Fair value524491,35424,36426,219Average yield(b)3.28%5.16%4.44%6.82%6.66%Certificates of deposit     Amortized cost$1,458$51$—$—$1,509Fair value1,45952——1,511Average yield(b)6.44%3.28%—%—%6.33%Non-U.S. government debt securities     Amortized cost$11,575$14,056$25,796$3,052$54,479Fair value11,61714,23826,3613,18555,401Average yield(b)3.10%2.49%1.37%1.46%2.03%Corporate debt securities     Amortized cost$4,229$10,231$5,827$—$20,287Fair value4,24510,5456,024—20,814Average yield(b)1.85%2.49%2.55%—%2.38%Asset-backed securities     Amortized cost$31$2,409$16,038$20,755$39,233Fair value312,43316,14920,92339,536Average yield(b)2.15%2.05%1.83%1.80%1.82%Total available-for-sale debt securities     Amortized cost$27,803$48,771$56,386$162,372$295,332Fair value27,88549,85957,392166,389301,525Average yield(b)2.12%2.05%1.83%3.30%2.70%Available-for-sale equity securities     Amortized cost$—$—$—$3,040$3,040Fair value———3,0543,054Average yield(b)—%—%—%0.17%0.17%Total available-for-sale securities     Amortized cost$27,803$48,771$56,386$165,412$298,372Fair value27,88549,85957,392169,443304,579Average yield(b)2.12%2.05%1.83%3.25%2.68%Total held-to-maturity securities     Amortized cost$—$57$325$46,889$47,271Fair value—5733147,17147,559Average yield(b)—%4.13%4.70%3.91%3.92%(a)U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were the only issuers whose securities exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2014.(b)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.(c)Includes securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately six years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, two years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and four years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 116Note 12 – Securities financing activities For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 on pages 255–257 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

As a result a net exposure amount is reported even though the Firm, on an aggregate basis for its securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, has received securities collateral with a total fair value that is greater than the funds provided to counterparties.(b)Includes financial instrument collateral received, repurchase liabilities and securities loaned liabilities with an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement; these amounts are not presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because other U.S. GAAP netting criteria are not met.117The following table presents as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned.

These transfers have been  recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets, other assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, and accounts payable and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.118Note 13 – LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:•Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans•Loans held-for-sale•Loans at fair value•PCI loans held-for-investment For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 98–99 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 on pages 86–97 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(c)Residential real estate – excluding PCI• Home equity – senior lien• Home equity – junior lien• Prime mortgage, including  option ARMs• Subprime mortgageOther consumer loans• Auto(b)• Business banking(b)• Student and otherResidential real estate – PCI• Home equity• Prime mortgage• Subprime mortgage• Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial• Real estate• Financial institutions• Government agencies• Other(d)(a)Includes loans held in CCB, and prime mortgage loans held in the AM business segment and in Corporate/Private Equity.(b)Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB and AM business segments and in Corporate/Private Equity. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.(d)Other primarily includes loans to SPEs and loans to private banking clients. See Note 1 on pages 189–191 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information on SPEs.119The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.March 31, 2014Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit card(a)WholesaleTotal (in millions) Retained$287,930$121,512$311,718$721,160(b) Held-for-sale2383046,9207,462 At fair value——2,3492,349 Total$288,168$121,816$320,987$730,971       December 31, 2013Consumer, excluding credit cardCredit card(a)WholesaleTotal (in millions) Retained$288,449$127,465$308,263$724,177(b) Held-for-sale61432611,29012,230 At fair value——2,0112,011 Total$289,063$127,791$321,564$738,418 (a)Includes billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.(b)Loans (other than PCI loans and those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and premiums, and net deferred loan costs of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.The following table provides information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis.

The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.(in millions)March 31, 2014December 31, 2013Residential real estate –  excluding PCI  Home equity:  Senior lien$16,635$17,113Junior lien39,49640,750Mortgages:  Prime, including option ARMs89,93887,162Subprime6,8697,104Other consumer loans  Auto52,95252,757Business banking18,99218,951Student and other11,44211,557Residential real estate – PCI  Home equity18,52518,927Prime mortgage11,65812,038Subprime mortgage4,0624,175Option ARMs17,36117,915Total retained loans$287,930$288,449 For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Residential real estate – excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate – excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm’s residential real estate – excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.121Residential real estate – excluding PCI loans  Home equity (in millions, except ratios)Senior lien  Junior lien March 31, 2014  December 31, 2013  March 31, 2014  December 31, 2013 Loan delinquency(a)           Current$16,039  $16,470  $38,704  $39,864 30–149 days past due250  298  566  662 150 or more days past due346  345  226  224 Total retained loans$16,635  $17,113  $39,496  $40,750 % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans3.58%  3.76%  2.01%  2.17% 90 or more days past due and still accruing$—  $—  $—  $— 90 or more days past due and government guaranteed(b)—  —  —  — Nonaccrual loans920  932  1,806  1,876 Current estimated LTV ratios(c)(d)(e)           Greater than 125% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 660$26  $40  $798  $1,101 Less than 66016  22  256  346 101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 660167  212  4,045  4,645 Less than 66088  107  1,230  1,407 80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 660747  858  7,649  7,995 Less than 660299  326  2,116  2,128 Less than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:           Equal to or greater than 66012,934  13,186  19,899  19,732 Less than 6602,358  2,362  3,503  3,396 U.S. government-guaranteed—  —  —  — Total retained loans$16,635  $17,113  $39,496  $40,750 Geographic region           California$2,339  $2,397  $8,976  $9,240 New York2,671  2,732  8,187  8,429 Illinois1,218  1,248  2,737  2,815 Florida828  847  2,096  2,167 Texas1,961  2,044  1,151  1,199 New Jersey618  630  2,375  2,442 Arizona985  1,019  1,764  1,827 Washington543  555  1,338  1,378 Michigan776  799  942  976 Ohio1,258  1,298  869  907 All other(f)3,438  3,544  9,061  9,370 Total retained loans$16,635  $17,113  $39,496  $40,750 (a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $5.1 billion and $4.7 billion; 30–149 days past due included $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion; and 150 or more days past due included $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(b)These balances, which are 90 days or more past due but insured by U.S. government agencies, are excluded from nonaccrual loans. In predominately all cases, 100% of the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, these balances included $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest because interest has been curtailed by the U.S. government agencies although, in predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal is still insured. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate.(c)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates.(d)Junior lien represents combined LTV, which considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property.(e)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.(f)At both March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $13.7 billion.(g)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.6 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.122(table continued from previous page)Mortgages     Prime, including option ARMs  Subprime  Total residential real estate – excluding PCI  March 31, 2014  December 31, 2013  March 31, 2014  December 31, 2013  March 31, 2014  December 31, 2013                    $79,492  $76,108  $5,837  $5,956  $140,072  $138,398  2,787  3,155  571  646  4,174  4,761  7,659  7,899  461  502  8,692  8,970  $89,938  $87,162  $6,869  $7,104  $152,938  $152,129  2.04%(g)  2.32%(g)  15.02%  16.16%  2.78%(g)  3.09%(g)  $—  $—  $—  $—  $—  $—  7,533  7,823  —  —  7,533  7,823  2,650  2,666  1,397  1,390  6,773  6,864                                      $1,102  $1,084  $30  $52  $1,956  $2,277  246  303  146  197  664  868                    1,149  1,433  212  249  5,573  6,539  538  687  510  597  2,366  2,798                    4,189  4,528  589  614  13,174  13,995  1,379  1,579  1,065  1,141  4,859  5,174                    62,297  58,477  1,998  1,961  97,128  93,356  5,307  5,359  2,319  2,293  13,487  13,410  13,731  13,712  —  —  13,731  13,712  $89,938  $87,162  $6,869  $7,104  $152,938  $152,129                    $22,861  $21,876  $1,041  $1,069  $35,217  $34,582  14,522  14,085  908  942  26,288  26,188  5,427  5,216  270  280  9,652  9,559  4,673  4,598  855  885  8,452  8,497  3,763  3,565  212  220  7,087  7,028  2,758  2,679  323  339  6,074  6,090  1,449  1,385  141  144  4,339  4,375  2,010  1,951  146  150  4,037  4,034  1,029  998  172  178  2,919  2,951  483  466  156  161  2,766  2,832  30,963  30,343  2,645  2,736  46,107  45,993  $89,938  $87,162  $6,869  $7,104  $152,938  $152,129  123The following tables represent the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options  available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm’s delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.124Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”).

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status.(b)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, $7.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.(c)Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 14 on pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.125The following table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Three months ended March 31,Average impaired loans Interest income onimpaired loans(a) Interest income on impaired loans on a cash basis(a)(in millions)20142013 20142013 20142013Home equity        Senior lien$1,143$1,139 $14$15 $9$10Junior lien1,3211,272 2120 1413Mortgages        Prime, including option ARMs6,9567,187 6869 1314Subprime3,6673,827 4950 1315Total residential real estate – excluding PCI$13,087$13,425 $152$154 $49$52(a)Generally, interest income on loans modified in TDRs is recognized on a cash basis until such time as the borrower has made a minimum of six payments under the new terms.Loan modificationsThe Firm is required to provide “borrower relief” under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This “borrower relief” includes reductions of principal and forbearance. For further information on these Consent Orders and settlements, see Business changes and developments in Note 2 on pages 192–194 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There are no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.126TDR activity rollforwardThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, modified in TDRs for the periods presented.Three months endedMarch 31,(in millions)Home equity Mortgages Total residentialreal estate – excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Beginning balance of TDRs$1,146$1,092 $1,319$1,223 $7,004$7,118 $3,698$3,812 $13,167$13,245New TDRs27101 58135 67310 28128 180674Charge-offs post-modification(a)(6)(10) (19)(33) (7)(19) (22)(38) (54)(100)Foreclosures and other liquidations (e.g., short sales)(6)(4) (2)(4) (28)(35) (12)(19) (48)(62)Principal payments and other(25)(24) (37)(35) (142)(151) (67)(40) (271)(250)Ending balance of TDRs$1,136$1,155 $1,319$1,286 $6,894$7,223 $3,625$3,843 $12,974$13,507Permanent modifications$1,100$1,116 $1,315$1,281 $6,773$6,958 $3,540$3,686 $12,728$13,041Trial modifications$36$39 $4$5 $121$265 $85$157 $246$466(a)Includes charge-offs on unsuccessful trial modifications.Nature and extent of modificationsMaking Home Affordable (“MHA”), as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term  or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At March 31, 2014, there were approximately 36,100 of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 8,600 senior lien home equity loans, 21,600 junior lien home equity loans, 3,000 prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 2,900 subprime mortgages.Three months ended March 31,Home equity Mortgages Total residentialreal estate - excluding PCISenior lien Junior lien Prime, including option ARMs Subprime 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Number of loans approved for a trial modification281500 343196 395976 6851,489 1,7043,161Number of loans permanently modified295545 9581,316 5311,476 7671,689 2,5515,026Concession granted:(a)              Interest rate reduction65%73% 84%90% 60%75% 60%69% 70%77%Term or payment extension8073 8378 8869 7250 8065Principal and/or interest deferred1510 2123 3327 2011 2219Principal forgiveness3039 2840 3141 4156 3246Other(b)1— —— 1724 1316 712(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified.

Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.Approximately 85% of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the HAMP program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At March 31, 2014, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months, are 17% for senior lien home equity, 20% for junior lien home equity, 15% for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 25% for subprime mortgages. Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge. Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10% and 40% in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At March 31, 2014, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 19% of senior lien home equity, 11% of junior lien home equity, 30% of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 20% of subprime mortgages that were 30 days or more past due.At March 31, 2014, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6 years for senior lien home equity, 7 years for junior lien home equity, 9 years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8 years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).128Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.(in millions, except ratios)Auto Business banking Student and other Total other consumer Mar 31, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Mar 31, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Mar 31, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Mar 31, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Loan delinquency(a)               Current$52,467 $52,152 $18,605$18,511 $10,458 $10,529 $81,530 $81,192 30–119 days past due447 599 226280 653 660 1,326 1,539 120 or more days past due38 6 161160 331 368 530 534 Total retained loans$52,952 $52,757 $18,992$18,951 $11,442 $11,557 $83,386 $83,265 % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans0.92% 1.15% 2.04%2.32% 2.60%(d) 2.52%(d) 1.40%(d) 1.60%(d) 90 or more days past due and still accruing (b)$— $— $—$— $387 $428 $387 $428 Nonaccrual loans137 161 356385 104 86 597 632 Geographic region               California$5,763 $5,615 $2,494$2,374 $1,112 $1,112 $9,369 $9,101 New York3,849 3,898 3,0713,084 1,227 1,218 8,147 8,200 Illinois3,003 2,917 1,3451,341 744 740 5,092 4,998 Florida2,051 2,012 679646 537 539 3,267 3,197 Texas5,250 5,310 2,5782,646 870 878 8,698 8,834 New Jersey1,954 2,014 395392 396 397 2,745 2,803 Arizona1,885 1,855 1,0301,046 254 252 3,169 3,153 Washington984 950 235234 223 227 1,442 1,411 Michigan1,855 1,902 1,3831,383 502 513 3,740 3,798 Ohio2,193 2,229 1,3031,316 692 708 4,188 4,253 All other24,165 24,055 4,4794,489 4,885 4,973 33,529 33,517 Total retained loans$52,952 $52,757 $18,992$18,951 $11,442 $11,557 $83,386 $83,265 Loans by risk ratings(c)               Noncriticized$9,680 $9,968 $13,693$13,622 NA NA $23,373 $23,590 Criticized performing80 54 725711 NA NA 805 765 Criticized nonaccrual32 38 295316 NA NA 327 354 (a)Individual delinquency classifications included loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) as follows: current included $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion; 30-119 days past due included $375 million and $387 million; and 120 or more days past due included $312 million and $350 million at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(b)These amounts represent student loans, which are insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP.

In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness. Beginning September 30, 2012, Chapter 7 auto loans are also considered TDRs.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions. The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $7 million and $12 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The balance of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $11 million and $13 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans for the periods presented.

As a result, an allowance for loan losses for impairment of these pools has been recognized.(c)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.(d)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.132Approximately 20% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth  delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.(in millions, except ratios)Total PCIThree months ended March 31,20142013Beginning balance$16,167$18,457Accretion into interest income(514)(573)Changes in interest rates on variable-rate loans(21)(159)Other changes in expected cash flows(a)1501,739Balance at March 31$15,782$19,464Accretable yield percentage4.32%4.35%(a)Other changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the Firm continues to refine its cash flow model and periodically updates model assumptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, other changes in expected cash flows were driven by changes in prepayment assumptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, other changes in expected cash flows were due to refining the expected interest cash flows on HELOCs with balloon payments; these incremental interest cash flows will not have a significant impact on the accretable yield percentage.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Since the date of acquisition, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, to extended loan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended or shortened loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expected cash flows and the accretable yield percentage, but not the amount of cash expected to be  received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). While extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage (because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time), shortened loan liquidation periods would have the opposite effect.133Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about the Firm’s credit card loans.(in millions, except ratios)March 31, 2014December 31, 2013Loan delinquency  Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing$119,560$125,33530–89 days past due and still accruing9761,10890 or more days past due and still accruing9761,022Nonaccrual loans——Total retained credit card loans$121,512$127,465Loan delinquency ratios  % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans1.61%1.67%% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans0.800.80Credit card loans by  geographic region  California$16,425$17,194New York10,02410,497Texas10,07310,400Illinois7,0217,412Florida6,8967,178New Jersey5,2825,554Ohio4,5824,881Pennsylvania4,2164,462Michigan3,3983,618Virginia3,0363,239All other50,55953,030Total retained credit card loans$121,512$127,465Percentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores  Equal to or greater than 66083.7%85.1%Less than 66016.314.9 Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 on pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans.

At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, $200 million and $226 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $127 million and $143 million at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed.134The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Three monthsended March 31,(in millions)20142013Average impaired credit card loans$2,938$4,521Interest income on impaired credit card loans3658Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60 months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, were $233 million and $339 million, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 30.43% and 30.72% for credit card loans modified as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.135Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating  assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Notes 14 and 15 on pages 258–287 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.

For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 1.0 years and 2.4 years, respectively. The weighted-average  remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.6 years and 1.7 years, respectively. There were no wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.139Note 14 – Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 on pages 284–287 JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. 2014 2013Three months ended March 31, (in millions)Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card WholesaleTotal Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card WholesaleTotalAllowance for loan losses             Beginning balance at January 1,$8,456 $3,795 $4,013$16,264 $12,292 $5,501 $4,143$21,936Gross charge-offs569 995 681,632 792 1,248 662,106Gross recoveries(201) (107) (55)(363) (184) (166) (31)(381)Net charge-offs368 888 131,269 608 1,082 351,725Write-offs of PCI loans(a)61 — —61 — — ——Provision for loan losses119 688 110917 (37) 582 24569Other1 (4) (1)(4) (2) (3) 5—Ending balance at March 31,$8,147 $3,591 $4,109$15,847 $11,645 $4,998 $4,137$20,780              Allowance for loan losses by impairment methodology             Asset-specific(b)$607 $606(c) $144$1,357 $771 $1,434(c) $228$2,433Formula-based3,443 2,985 3,96510,393 5,163 3,564 3,90912,636PCI4,097 — —4,097 5,711 — —5,711Total allowance for loan losses$8,147 $3,591 $4,109$15,847 $11,645 $4,998 $4,137$20,780              Loans by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$13,546 $2,768 $763$17,077 $14,189 $4,287 $1,302$19,778Formula-based222,778 118,744 310,949652,471 217,456 117,578 309,271644,305PCI51,606 — 651,612 58,437 — 958,446Total retained loans$287,930 $121,512 $311,718$721,160 $290,082 $121,865 $310,582$722,529              Impaired collateral-dependent loans             Net charge-offs$51 $— $—$51 $78 $— $6$84Loans measured at fair value of collateral less cost to sell3,333 — 3313,664 3,153 — 4323,585              Allowance for lending-related commitments             Beginning balance at January 1,$8 $— $697$705 $7 $— $661$668Provision for lending-related commitments— — (67)(67) — — 4848Other— — —— — — ——Ending balance at March 31,$8 $— $630$638 $7 $— $709$716              Allowance for lending-related commitments by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$— $— $30$30 $— $— $82$82Formula-based8 — 600608 7 — 627634Total allowance for lending-related commitments$8 $— $630$638 $7 $— $709$716              Lending-related commitments by impairment methodology             Asset-specific$— $— $95$95 $— $— $244$244Formula-based56,541 535,614 456,4361,048,591 60,874 537,455 435,0371,033,366Total lending-related commitments$56,541 $535,614 $456,531$1,048,686 $60,874 $537,455 $435,281$1,033,610(a)Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CIB and CCB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 on pages 289–292 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.141The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 146 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities on pages 146–147 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

The Firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.(c)The table above excludes the following: retained servicing (see Note 16 on pages 148–151 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of MSRs); securities retained from loans sales to U.S. government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities (See Note 5 on pages 100–109 of this Form 10-Q for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $156 million and $77 million, respectively, at March 31, 2014, and $151 million and $30 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.(d)Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.(e)As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, 68% and 69%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $528 million and $551 million of investment-grade and $226 million and $260 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $3.9 billion and $3.9 billion of investment-grade and $86 million and $80 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.142Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 on page 291 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 145 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 on page 291 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. See the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 on pages 291–292 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.During the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Firm transferred $5.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $169 million and zero, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm consolidated $84 million and $86 million, respectively, of assets, and $22 million and $23 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 145 of this Note for more information on consolidated re-securitization transactions. As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm held approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $19 million and $6 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 142 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 288–296 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $4.9 billion and $4.1 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments were not driven by market liquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity, and credit enhancement provided by the Firm to the multi-seller conduits have been eliminated in consolidation. Unfunded lending-related commitments made to clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits were $10.3 billion and $9.1 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21 on pages 155–158 of this Form 10-Q.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 293–294 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.143The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows.(in billions)Fair value of assets held by VIEsLiquidity facilitiesExcess/(deficit)(a)Maximum exposureNonconsolidated municipal bond vehicles    March 31, 2014$11.8$6.6$5.2$6.6December 31, 201311.86.94.96.9 Ratings profile of VIE assets(b)Fair value of assets held by VIEsWt. avg. expected life of assets (years) Investment-grade Noninvestment- grade(in billions, except where otherwise noted)AAA to AAA-AA+ to AA-A+ to A-BBB+ to BBB- BB+ and belowMarch 31, 2014$2.9$8.7$0.2$— $—$11.85.1December 31, 20132.78.90.2— —11.87.2(a)Represents the excess/(deficit) of the fair values of municipal bond assets available to repay the liquidity facilities, if drawn.(b)The ratings scale is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 294–296 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Exposure to nonconsolidated credit-related note and asset swap VIEs at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was as follows.March 31, 2014 (in billions)Net derivative receivablesTotal exposurePar value of collateral held by VIEs(a)Credit-related notes   Static structure$0.1$0.1$3.8Managed structure——3.5Total credit-related notes0.10.17.3Asset swaps0.60.67.7Total$0.7$0.7$15.0    December 31, 2013(in billions)Net derivative receivablesTotal exposurePar value of collateral held by VIEs(a)Credit-related notes   Static structure$—$—$4.8Managed structure——3.9Total credit-related notes——8.7Asset swaps0.40.47.7Total$0.4$0.4$16.4(a)The Firm’s maximum exposure arises through the derivatives executed with the VIEs; the exposure varies over time with changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The Firm relies on the collateral held by the VIEs to pay any amounts due under the derivatives; the vehicles are structured at inception so that the par value of the collateral is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts due under the derivative contracts. The Firm consolidated credit-related note vehicles with collateral fair values of $324 million and $311 million, at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. These consolidated VIEs included some that were structured by the Firm where the Firm provides the credit derivative, and some that have been structured by third parties where the Firm is not the credit derivative provider. The Firm consolidated these vehicles because it held positions in these entities that provided the Firm with control. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as aderivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. Thesetransactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individualcredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specificVIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlyingassets. Where the Firm does not have the power to directthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact theVIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest thatcould potentially be significant, the Firm records andreports these positions on its Consolidated Balance Sheetssimilarly to the way it would record and report positions inrespect of any other third-party transaction.144Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.

The difference between total assets and total liabilities recognized for consolidated VIEs represents the Firm’s interest in the consolidated VIEs for each program type.(f)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $32.2 billion and $31.8 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The maturities of the long-term beneficial interests as of March 31, 2014, were as follows: $4.8 billion under one year, $20.0 billion between one and five years, and $7.4 billion over five years, all respectively.(g)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.145Loan SecuritizationsThe Firm securitizes a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans. For a further  description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note 16 on page 288 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Cash flows from securitizationsThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.

For the three months ended March 31, 2014, $2.0 billion of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, $634 million of proceeds from residential mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, $2.1 billion of commercial mortgage securitizations were received as securities classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and $207 million of proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations were received as cash.(c)Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from off–balance sheet, nonconsolidated entities – for example, loan repurchases due to representation and warranties and servicer clean-up calls.(d)Includes prime, Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes sales for which the Firm did not securitize the loan (including loans sold to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).(e)Includes commercial and student loan securitizations.Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “Agencies”). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans and excess mortgage servicing rights through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 on pages 318–324 of the JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 on pages 148–151 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. agencies and third-party-sponsored securitization entities.

Gains on loans sales include the value of MSRs.(d)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.146Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21 on pages 155–158 of this Form 10-Q, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm may elect to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $14.0 billion and $14.3  billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 13 on pages 119–139 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 on pages 258–283 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.

Goodwill was not impaired at March 31, 2014, or December 31, 2013, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.While no impairment of goodwill was recognized, the Firm’s Mortgage Banking business in CCB remains at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. economic conditions and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of this business is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities), and the amount of equity capital required. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models including the amount of capital necessary given the risk of business activities to meet regulatory capital requirements were determined using management’s best estimates. The cost of equity reflected the related risks and uncertainties, and was evaluated in comparison to relevant market peers. Deterioration in these assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.Mortgage servicing rightsMortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 299–304 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report and Note 3 on pages 86–97 of this Form 10-Q.148The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.

In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired and has retained the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. Also includes sales of MSRs for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.(b)Included changes related to commercial real estate of $(2) million and $(2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(c)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.(d)Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.(e)Included $16 million and $21 million related to commercial real estate at March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(f)Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest to a trust, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.(g)For the three months ended March 31, 2014, the decrease was primarily related to higher capital allocated to the Mortgage Servicing business, which, in turn, resulted in an increase in the option adjusted spread (“OAS”). The resulting OAS assumption continues to be consistent with capital and return requirements that the Firm believes a market participant would consider, taking into account factors such as the current operating risk environment and regulatory and economic capital requirements. (h)For the three months ended March 31, 2013, the increase was driven by the inclusion in the MSR valuation model of servicing fees receivable on certain delinquent loans.(i)For the three months ended March 31, 2013, the decrease was driven by changes in the inputs and assumptions used to derive prepayment speeds, primarily increases in home prices.149The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates)March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”)8.35% 8.07%Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change$(370) $(362)Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change(718) (705)Weighted-average option adjusted spread9.05% 7.77%Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change$(364) $(389)Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change(700) (750)CPR: Constant prepayment rate. The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsThe $129 million decrease in other intangible assets during the three months ended March 31, 2014, was due to amortization.150The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows.

The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Basel III rules under the transitional Standardized Approach (“Basel III Standardized Transitional”) became effective on January 1, 2014; all prior period data is based on Basel I rules. For 2014, the Basel III Standardized Transitional requires the Firm to calculate its capital ratios using the Basel III definition of capital divided by the Basel I definition of RWA, inclusive of Basel 2.5 for market risk.There are three categories of risk-based capital: Common equity Tier 1 capital (“Tier 1 common”) which was effective January 1, 2014, under the Basel III Transitional rules, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 common includes common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and certain other adjustments. Tier 1 capital consists of Tier 1 common plus perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred securities that have not  been phased out of Tier 1 capital under Basel III rules. Tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, trust preferred securities phased out of Tier 1 capital under Basel III rules, subordinated long-term debt and other instruments qualifying as Tier 2 capital, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. Banking subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.The following table presents the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking subsidiaries at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013. These amounts are determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and/or OCC.

Beginning January 1, 2015, Basel III Transitional Tier 1 common and the Basel III Standardized Transitional Tier 1 common ratio become relevant capital measures under the prompt corrective action requirements as defined by the regulations.(f)Represents requirements for banking subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. There is no Tier 1 leverage component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company.Note:Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both non-taxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from non-taxable business combinations totaling $167 million and $192 million at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $2.8 billion at both March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.154Note 21 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 318–324 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale lending commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on page 140 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. Also, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due.155Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments  Contractual amount Carrying value(g) Mar 31, 2014Dec 31, 2013 Mar 31, 2014Dec 31, 2013By remaining maturity (in millions)Expires in 1 year or lessExpires after 1 year through 3 yearsExpires after 3 years through 5 yearsExpires after 5 yearsTotalTotal   Lending-related         Consumer, excluding credit card:         Home equity – senior lien$2,357$4,345$3,804$2,154$12,660$13,158 $—$—Home equity – junior lien3,8296,6954,3352,18117,04017,837 ——Prime mortgage5,224———5,2244,817 ——Subprime mortgage—————— ——Auto8,81431011979,2508,309 11Business banking10,47983910832611,75211,251 77Student and other70803462615685 ——Total consumer, excluding credit card30,77312,2698,3695,13056,54156,057 88Credit card535,614———535,614529,383 ——Total consumer566,38712,2698,3695,130592,155585,440 88Wholesale:         Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(a)(b)71,54977,235101,3978,810258,991246,495 394432Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(a)(b)(c)23,57731,78432,2152,68590,26192,723 832943Unused advised lines of credit90,32611,309614390102,639101,994 ——Other letters of credit(a)3,730689206154,6405,020 12Total wholesale189,182121,017134,43211,900456,531446,232 1,2271,377Total lending-related$755,569$133,286$142,801$17,030$1,048,686$1,031,672 $1,235$1,385Other guarantees and commitments         Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(d)$219,993$—$—$—$219,993$169,709 $——Derivatives qualifying as guarantees3,16085815,69637,54957,26356,274 $106$72Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements(e)68,445———68,44538,211 ——Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:         Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NANANA 564681Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA7,3027,692 123131Other guarantees and commitments(f)7064822,4593,0976,7446,786 (89)(99)(a)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, reflects the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $365 million and $476 million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $14.5 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $842 million and $622 million, respectively, for other letters of credit.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit also include liquidity facilities to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs; for further information, see Note 15 on pages 141–147 of this Form 10-Q.(c)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included unissued standby letters of credit commitments of $43.1 billion and $42.8 billion, respectively.(d)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $228.4 billion and $176.4 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral comprises primarily cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies.(e)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the amount of commitments related to forward-starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements were $27.1 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements with regular-way settlement periods were $41.3 billion and $28.3 billion, at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.(f)At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included unfunded commitments of $160 million and $215 million, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $1.9 billion, at both March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, to other equity investments. These commitments included $119 million and $184 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3 on pages 86–97 of this Form 10-Q. In addition, at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.(g)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value.156Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, and extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged and acquisition finance activities, which were $26.9 billion and $18.3 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 86–97 and pages 98–99 respectively, of this Form 10-Q.In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as clearing and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. Tri-party repurchase daily balances averaged $182 billion and $296 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. GuaranteesThe Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 318–324 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $833 million and $945 million at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $236 million and $265 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $597 million and $680 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013(in millions)Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesOther letters of credit Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesOther letters of creditInvestment-grade(a) $67,270 $3,779  $69,109 $3,939Noninvestment-grade(a) 22,991 861  23,614 1,081Total contractual amount $90,261 $4,640  $92,723 $5,020Allowance for lending-related commitments $235 $1  $263 $2Commitments with collateral 40,160 1,543  40,410 1,473(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s.157Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 on pages 318–324 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $57.3 billion and $56.3 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $27.1 billion and $27.0 billion at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.8 billion at both March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $145 million and $109 million and derivative receivables of $39 million and $37 million at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5 on page 109 of this Form 10-Q.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsMortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs, as described in Note 15 on pages 141–147 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 on pages 288–299 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm has been, and may be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs (e.g., with “make-whole” payments to reimburse the GSEs for their realized losses on liquidated loans). To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense. On October 25, 2013, the Firm announced that it had reached a $1.1 billion agreement with the FHFA to resolve, other than certain limited types of exposures, outstanding and future mortgage repurchase demands associated with loans sold to the GSEs from 2000 to 2008. For additional information, see Note 29 on pages 318–324 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability  Three months ended March 31,(in millions) 2014 2013Repurchase liability at beginning of period $681 $2,811Net realized gains/(losses)(a) 11 (212)(Benefit)/provision for repurchase(b) (128) 75Repurchase liability at end of period $564 $2,674(a)Presented net of third-party recoveries and include principal losses and accrued interest on repurchased loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expense. Make-whole settlements were $2 million and $121 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(b)Included a provision related to new loan sales of $1 million and $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Private label securitizationsThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 on pages 159–165 of this Form 10-Q and Note 31 on pages 326–332 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Loans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $123 million and $131 million at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.158Note 22 – Pledged assets and collateral For a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, see Note 30 on page 325 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Pledged assetsAt March 31, 2014, financial assets were pledged to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial assets owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had pledged assets of $260.4 billion and $251.3 billion, respectively, at Federal Reserve Banks and FHLBs. In addition, as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had pledged $64.8 billion and $60.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 on pages 141–147 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities, see Note 12 on pages 117–118 of this Form 10-Q. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt, see Note 21 on pages 306–308 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.CollateralAt March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $768.7 billion and $726.7 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $587.0 billion and $543.5 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. Note 23 – LitigationContingenciesAs of March 31, 2014, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $4.5 billion at March 31, 2014. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm’s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm’s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.CIO Investigations and Litigation. A consolidated purported class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and two shareholder derivative actions that were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Southern District”), relating to losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”), have been dismissed in their entirety. Shareholder derivative actions filed in New York state court have also been dismissed, except for one action that is currently stayed. A consolidated shareholder purported class action filed in the Southern District has been dismissed in part, and the Firm and other defendants will answer the remaining allegations in the complaint. The Firm has also responded to shareholder demands for information and continues to cooperate with ongoing government investigations relating to CIO.159Credit Default Swaps Investigations and Litigation. In July 2013, the European Commission (the “EC”) filed a Statement of Objections against the Firm (including various subsidiaries) and other industry members in connection with its ongoing investigation into the credit default swaps (“CDS”) marketplace. The EC asserts that between 2006 and 2009, a number of investment banks acted collectively through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) and Markit Group Limited (“Markit”) to foreclose exchanges from the potential market for exchange-traded credit derivatives by instructing Markit and ISDA to license their respective data and index benchmarks only for over-the-counter (“OTC”) trading and not for exchange trading, allegedly to protect the investment banks’ revenues from the OTC market. The Firm submitted a response to the Statement of Objections in January 2014, and a hearing has been scheduled for May 2014. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) also has an ongoing investigation into the CDS marketplace, which was initiated in July 2009.Separately, the Firm is a defendant in a number of purported class actions (all consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) filed on behalf of purchasers and sellers of CDS. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in January 2014, alleging that the defendant investment banks, including the Firm, as well as Markit and/or ISDA, collectively prevented new entrants into the CDS market, in order to artificially inflate the defendant banks’ revenues in violation of federal antitrust laws. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm has received information requests, document production notices and related inquiries from various U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies regarding the Firm’s foreign exchange trading business. The Firm is cooperating with these ongoing investigations and inquiries.Since November 2013, a number of class actions have been filed in the United Stated District Court for the Southern District of New York against a number of foreign exchange dealers, including the Firm, for alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and unjust enrichment based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates reported on the WM/Reuters service. A consolidated class action complaint was filed in March 2014.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints relating to interchange in several federal courts. The complaints alleged that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. All cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings.The parties have entered into an agreement to settle those cases, for a cash payment of $6.1 billion to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm’s share is approximately 20%)  and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network’s rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. The rule modifications became effective in January 2013. In January 2014, the Court issued the Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment granting final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants have filed notices of appeal. Certain merchants that opted out of the class settlement have filed actions against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. Defendants moved to dismiss those opt-out cases in March 2014.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending cases which allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management (“JPMIM”) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited claim that JPMIM is liable for losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. Discovery is proceeding.Italian Proceedings.City of Milan. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the “City”) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the District Court of Milan alleging a breach of advisory obligations in connection with a bond issue by the City in June 2005 and an associated swap transaction. The Firm has entered into a settlement agreement with the City to resolve the City’s civil proceedings.Four current and former JPMorgan Chase employees and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) were directed by a criminal judge to participate in a trial that started in May 2010. As it relates to JPMorgan Chase individuals, two were acquitted and two were found guilty of aggravated fraud with sanctions of prison sentences, fines and a ban from dealing with Italian public bodies for one year. JPMorgan Chase (along with other banks involved) was found liable for breaches of Italian administrative law. JPMorgan Chase and the individuals appealed, and in March 2014, the court fully acquitted JPMorgan Chase and its employees. If the Italian authority decides to appeal this acquittal to the Italian Supreme Court, it must do so before the end of July 2014.Parmalat. In 2003, following the bankruptcy of the Parmalat group of companies (“Parmalat”), criminal prosecutors in Italy investigated the activities of Parmalat, its directors and the financial institutions that had dealings with them following the collapse of the company. In March 2012, the criminal prosecutor served a notice indicating an intention to pursue criminal proceedings against four former employees of the Firm (but not against the Firm) on charges of conspiracy to cause Parmalat’s insolvency by underwriting bonds and continuing derivatives trading when Parmalat’s balance sheet was false. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 2014, at which the judge will 160determine whether to recommend that the matter go to a full trial. In addition, the administrator of Parmalat commenced five civil actions against JPMorgan Chase entities including: two claw-back actions; a claim relating to bonds issued by Parmalat in which it is alleged that JPMorgan Chase kept Parmalat “artificially” afloat and delayed the declaration of insolvency; and similar allegations in two claims relating to derivatives transactions.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Committee”) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $7.9 billion in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI’s bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s collateral requests hastened LBHI’s bankruptcy. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint that sought to void the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008.The Firm has also filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion in claims (the “Clearing Claims”) against the estate of Lehman Brothers Inc., LBHI’s broker-dealer subsidiary. Discovery is ongoing.LBHI and the Committee have also filed an objection to the claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to the Clearing Claims, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for such claims in a commercially reasonable manner. LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors have also filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm responded to this separate complaint and objection in February 2013. The Clearing Claims and the derivatives claims, together with other claims of the Firm against Lehman entities, have been paid in full, subject to the outcome of the objections filed by LBHI and the Committee. Discovery in both of these cases is ongoing.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the  European Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. In December 2013, JPMorgan Chase reached a settlement with the European Commission regarding its Japanese Yen LIBOR investigation. Investigations by the European Commission with regard to other reference rates remain open. In January 2014, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced that it has discontinued its investigation related to Yen LIBOR.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class actions filed in various United States District Courts in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR and/or Euroyen TIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are impacted by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR or Euroyen TIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages.The U.S. dollar LIBOR-related purported class actions have been consolidated in a Multidistrict Litigation for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In March 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims, including dismissal with prejudice of the antitrust and unjust enrichment claims. One of the class action plaintiffs who asserted only antitrust claims appealed the dismissal of its action, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In March 2014, the plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States seeking review of the Second Circuit’s dismissal of its appeal. In September 2013, certain plaintiffs filed amended complaints and others sought leave to amend their complaints to add additional allegations. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaints and have opposed the requests to amend. Those motions remain pending. As additional complaints continue to be filed, the Firm will seek to have them transferred to the Multidistrict Litigation.161The Firm has also been named as a defendant in a separate purported class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased and sold Euroyen TIBOR futures contracts. The action alleges manipulation of Yen LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR. In March 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss, including dismissal of the antitrust claims and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants have filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s decision not to dismiss certain Commodity Exchange Act claims.The Firm was also named as a nominal defendant in a derivative action in the Supreme Court of New York in the County of New York against certain current and former members of the Firm’s board of directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm’s purported role in manipulating LIBOR. In March 2014, the Court dismissed the derivative action with prejudice.Madoff Litigation and Investigations. In January 2014, certain of the Firm’s bank subsidiaries entered into settlements with various governmental agencies in resolution of investigations relating to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“BLMIS”). The Firm and certain of its subsidiaries also settled civil litigation relating to BLMIS.JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (the “U.S. Attorney”) in which it agreed to forfeit $1.7 billion to the United States. Pursuant to the DPA, the U.S. Attorney will defer prosecution of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for a two-year period if the bank complies with its obligations under the DPA. The DPA has been approved by the court. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., consented to the assessment of a $350 million Civil Money Penalty by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. agreed to the assessment of a $461 million Civil Money Penalty by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). The FinCEN penalty was deemed satisfied by the payment to the U.S. Attorney.Additionally, the Firm and certain subsidiaries entered into settlements with the court-appointed trustee for BLMIS (the “Trustee”) and with plaintiffs representing a class of former BLMIS customers who lost all or a portion of their principal investments with BLMIS. As part of these settlements, the Firm and the bank agreed to pay the Trustee $325 million, and agreed to pay the class action plaintiffs $218 million, as well as attorneys’ fees. The settlements with the Trustee and the class action plaintiffs have been approved by the court.Also, various subsidiaries of the Firm, including J.P. Morgan Securities plc, have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, “Fairfield”), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions seek to recover payments made by the funds to defendants totaling  approximately $155 million. Pursuant to an agreement with the Trustee, the liquidators of Fairfield have voluntarily dismissed their action against J.P. Morgan Securities plc without prejudice to re-filing. The other actions remain outstanding. In addition, a purported class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against the Firm and certain subsidiaries to an already pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The Court dismissed these complaints and plaintiffs appealed. In September 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision. The plaintiffs have petitioned the entire Court for a rehearing of the appeal and the Firm has filed its answer to that petition.The Firm is a defendant in five other Madoff-related investor actions pending in New York state court. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The Firm has moved to dismiss these actions.Two actions have been filed, in the United States District Courts for the District of New Jersey and the Middle District of Florida, by investors who (with a few exceptions) did not suffer losses on their principal investments with BLMIS. The action commenced in New Jersey is a purported class action while the Florida action was brought by a group of investors. These plaintiffs generally allege violations of the federal securities law, federal and state racketeering statutes and multiple common law claims. Additionally, two shareholder derivative actions have been filed in New York federal and state court against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former Board members, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm’s relationship with Madoff due to an alleged failure to maintain effective internal controls to detect fraudulent transactions.MF Global. The Firm has responded to inquiries from the CFTC relating to the Firm’s banking and other business relationships with MF Global, including as a depository for MF Global’s customer segregated accounts.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one of several defendants in a number of purported class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global’s publicly traded securities asserting violations of federal securities laws and alleging that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global. The actions have been consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates (together, “JPMC”), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, “Bear Stearns”) and Washington Mutual affiliates 162(together, “Washington Mutual”) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). These cases include purported class action suits on behalf of MBS purchasers, actions by individual MBS purchasers and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of MBS offerings. Following the settlements referred to under “Repurchase Litigation” and “Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation” below, there are currently pending and tolled investor and monoline insurer claims involving MBS with an original principal balance of approximately $73 billion, of which $66 billion involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual as issuer and $7 billion involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual solely as underwriter. The Firm and certain of its current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities, and trustees have asserted or have threatened to assert claims that loans in securitization trusts should be repurchased.Issuer Litigation – Class Actions. The Firm is a defendant in three purported class actions brought against JPMC and Bear Stearns as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings) in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. The Firm has settled one of these purported class actions, pending in the Eastern District of New York, and the plaintiffs have moved for preliminary approval of the settlement. Motions to dismiss have largely been denied in the remaining two cases pending in the Southern District of New York, which are in various stages of litigation.Issuer Litigation – Individual Purchaser Actions. In addition to class actions, the Firm is defending individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings). These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the United States and are in various stages of litigation.Monoline Insurer Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending actions relating to a monoline insurer’s guarantees of principal and interest on certain classes of 11 different Bear Stearns MBS offerings. These actions are pending in state courts in New York and are in various stages of litigation. JPMorgan Chase has resolved three actions brought by Syncora Guarantee Inc. relating to its guarantees of principal and interest on certain classes of Bear Stearns MBS offerings.Underwriter Actions. In actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable in various situations, such as where the issuers are now defunct. Actions of this type are currently pending against the Firm in federal and state courts and are in various stages of litigation.Repurchase Litigation. The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees or master servicers of various  MBS trusts and others on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys’ fees and costs and other remedies. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, has filed such a suit against JPMC, Washington Mutual and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) in connection with a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation.In addition, the Firm has received threatened litigation demands by securitization trustees, as well as demands by investors directing trustees to investigate claims or bring litigation, which allege obligations to repurchase loans and servicing deficiencies. These include a demand from a law firm, as counsel to a group of 21 institutional MBS investors, to various trustees to investigate potential repurchase and servicing claims. These investors purported to have 25% or more of the voting rights in trusts sponsored by the Firm or its affiliates with an original principal balance of more than $174 billion (excluding 52 trusts sponsored by Washington Mutual, with an original principal balance of more than $58 billion). Pursuant to a settlement agreement, JPMC and this investor group have made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to the 330 MBS trusts. The offer, which is subject to acceptance by the trustees, and potentially a judicial approval process, does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. The trustees currently have until June 16, 2014 to accept the settlement offer.There are additional repurchase and servicing claims made against trustees not affiliated with the Firm but involving trusts that the Firm sponsored.Derivative Actions. Eight shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities have been filed to date against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors, in New York state court and California federal court. In one of the New York state actions, the Firm’s motion to dismiss was granted and the dismissal was affirmed on appeal. The Firm’s motion to dismiss was also granted in another one of these actions, filed in New York state court. In addition, the five actions filed in California federal court have been consolidated and an amended consolidated complaint has been filed. Defendants intend to file motions to dismiss the remaining actions.Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Firm resolved actual and potential civil claims by the DOJ and several State Attorneys General relating to residential mortgage-backed securities 163activities by JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, in addition to resolving litigation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration. The Firm also agreed to resolve Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s repurchase claims associated with whole loan purchases from 2000 to 2008.The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. The Firm has also received other subpoenas and informal requests for information from state authorities concerning the issuance and underwriting of MBS-related matters. The Firm continues to respond to these MBS-related regulatory inquiries.In addition, the Firm is responding to and cooperating with requests for information from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut, subpoenas and requests from the SEC Division of Enforcement, and a request from the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program to conduct a review of certain activities, all of which relate to, among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain secondary market trading in MBS. The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation.Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorney General of Massachusetts filed an action against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company, asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry’s electronic mortgage registry. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the action, which remains pending.The Firm is named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. The plaintiffs have moved for class certification.One shareholder derivative action has been filed in New York Supreme Court against current and former members of the Firm’s Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing.In February 2014, the Firm entered into a settlement with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) agreeing to pay $614 million to resolve claims relating to the Firm’s participation in federal mortgage insurance programs overseen by FHA, HUD and VA. The Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm’s compliance with the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) in connection with its mortgage lending practices. In addition, two municipalities are pursuing investigations into the impact, if any, of alleged violations of the FHA and ECOA on their respective communities. The Firm is cooperating in these investigations.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees.164Power Matters. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is investigating matters relating to the bidding activities that were the subject of the July 2013 settlement between J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Firm is cooperating with the investigation. Referral Hiring Practices Investigations. Various regulators are investigating, among other things, the Firm’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with respect to the Firm’s hiring practices related to candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials, and its engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations.Sworn Documents, Debt Sales and Collection Litigation Practices. The Firm has been responding to formal and informal inquiries from various state and federal regulators regarding practices involving credit card collections litigation (including with respect to sworn documents), the sale of consumer credit card debt and securities backed by credit card receivables. Separately, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and multiple state Attorneys General are conducting investigations into the Firm’s collection and sale of consumer credit card debt. The California and Mississippi Attorneys General have filed separate civil actions against JPMorgan Chase & Co., Chase Bank USA, N.A. and Chase BankCard Services, Inc. alleging violations of law relating to debt collection practices.Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual, Inc. subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. The District Court denied as premature motions by the Firm and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank’s claims. Discovery is underway.An action filed by certain holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt against JPMorgan Chase, which alleged that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at a price that was allegedly too low, remains pending. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs’ claim that the Firm tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs’ bond contracts with Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closure. Discovery is ongoing.JPMorgan Chase has also filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank and in its corporate capacity asserting multiple claims for  indemnification under the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement between JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC relating to JPMorgan Chase’s purchase of most of the assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank. * * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. Firmwide legal expense was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2014. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Firm incurred $347 million of legal expense. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.165Note 24 – Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business Segment Results on page 18 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 84–85 and Note 33 on pages 334–337 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report.Segment resultsThe accompanying tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results for the three months ended March 31,  2014 and 2013, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm revised the capital allocated to certain businesses and will continue to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments. Further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Segment results and reconciliation(a)As of or for the three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios)Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset Management20142013 20142013 20142013 20142013Noninterest revenue$3,434$4,406 $6,236$7,357 $558$535 $2,218$2,094Net interest income7,0267,209 2,3702,783 1,0931,138 560559Total net revenue10,46011,615 8,60610,140 1,6511,673 2,7782,653Provision for credit losses816549 4911 539 (9)21Noninterest expense6,4376,790 5,6046,111 686644 2,0751,876Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)3,2074,276 2,9534,018 960990 712756Income tax expense/(benefit)1,2711,690 9741,408 382394 271269Net income/(loss)$1,936$2,586 $1,979$2,610 $578$596 $441$487Average common equity$51,000$46,000 $61,000$56,500 $14,000$13,500 $9,000$9,000Total assets441,502458,902 879,992872,259 191,389184,689 124,478109,734Return on average common equity15%23% 13%19% 17%18% 20%22%Overhead ratio6258 6560 4238 7571As of or for the three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios)Corporate/Private Equity Reconciling Items(b) Total20142013 20142013 20142013Noninterest revenue$524$361 $(644)$(564) $12,326$14,189Net interest income(156)(594) (226)(162) 10,66710,933Total net revenue368(233) (870)(726) 22,99325,122Provision for credit losses(11)(3) —— 850617Noninterest expense(166)2 —— 14,63615,423Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)545(232) (870)(726) 7,5079,082Income tax expense/(benefit)205(482) (870)(726) 2,2332,553Net income/(loss)$340$250 $—$— $5,274$6,529Average common equity$66,797$69,733 $—$— $201,797$194,733Total assets839,625763,765 NANA 2,476,9862,389,349Return on average common equityNMNM NMNM 10%13%Overhead ratioNMNM NMNM 6461(a)Managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications as discussed below that do not have any impact on net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole.(b)Segment managed results reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 19, 2014, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.Allowance for loan losses to total loans: Represents period-end allowance for loan losses divided by retained loans.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt, equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates.Benefit obligation: Refers to the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans.Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e., Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security and is assigned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s. This system facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities. A similar system is used to identify non- U.S. securities (CUSIP International Numbering System).Exchange traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk provided by credit bureaus, typically produced from statistical models by Fair Isaac Corporation utilizing data collected by the credit bureaus.Forward points: Represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., “spot rate”) to determine the forward exchange rate.Group of Seven (“G7”) nations: Countries in the G7 are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. G7 government bonds: Bonds issued by the government of one of the G7 nations.Headcount-related expense: Includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.Home equity - senior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds the first security interest on the property.Home equity - junior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens.Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment system. “Investment grade” generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a “BBB-”/“Baa3” or better, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.LLC: Limited Liability Company.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single 169currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.Mortgage product types:Alt-AAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans to customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningful.Over-the-counter derivatives (“OTC”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.Over-the-counter cleared derivatives (“OTC cleared”): Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instruments, private equity investments, and physical commodities used in market-making and client-driven activities. In addition, Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specified risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same 170fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”): Risk-weighted assets consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk-weighted assets.Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the related mortgage and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds.Structural Interest Rate Risk: Represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm.Structured notes: Structured notes are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. Where present, the embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.Trade-date and settlement-date: For financial instruments, the trade-date is the date that an order to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire an instrument is executed in the market. The trade-date may differ from the settlement-date, which is the date on which the actual transfer of a financial instrument between two parties is executed. The amount of time that passes between the trade-date and the settlement-date differs depending on the financial instrument. For repurchases under the common equity repurchase program, except where the trade-date is specified, the amounts disclosed are presented on a settlement-date basis. In the Capital Management section on pages 63–70, of this Form 10-Q, and where otherwise specified, repurchases under the common equity repurchase program are presented on a trade-date basis because the trade-date is used to calculate the Firm’s regulatory capital.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations:Obligations of agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury.Value-at-risk (“VaR”): A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.171Wallet: Proportion of fee revenues based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e. the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Item 4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 182 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2013 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.174Part II Other InformationItem 1 Legal ProceedingsFor information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in the Firm’s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, see the discussion of the Firm’s material litigation in Note 23 on pages 159–165 of this Form 10-Q.Item 1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of certain risk factors affecting the Firm,see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9–18 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013; and Forward-Looking Statements on page 79 of this Form 10-Q.Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
