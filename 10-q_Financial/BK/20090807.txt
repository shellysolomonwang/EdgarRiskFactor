See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    72 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 1 — Basis of presentation    The accounting and financial reporting policies of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a global financial services company, conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing industry practices. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based upon assumptions about future economic and market conditions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that in the remainder of 2009, actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Amounts subject to significant estimates are items such as the allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and post-retirement obligations, the fair value of financial instruments and other-than-temporary impairments. Among other effects, such changes could result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets and establishment of allowances for loan losses and lending related commitments as well as increased pension and post-retirement expense.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been made. Certain other immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with current period presentation. We have evaluated events occurring subsequent to June 30, 2009 for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements through August 7, 2009.  Note 2 — Accounting changes and new accounting pronouncements  SFAS No. 160 (ASC 810-10) – Noncontrolling Interests and EITF 08-10 – Selected SFAS No. 160 Implementation Questions  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 (ASC 810-10) (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”. SFAS 160 (ASC 810-10) amends   ARB No. 51 (ASC 810-10) to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (i.e., minority interest) and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements. This statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is to be part of the equity of the controlling group and is to be reported on the balance sheet within the equity section separately from the Company’s equity as a distinct item. The equity section of the balance sheet is required to present equity attributable to both controlling and noncontrolling interests. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in ownership interest, and any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity attributable to the noncontrolling interest (i.e., as additional paid in capital). Any transaction that results in the loss of control of a subsidiary is considered a remeasurement event with any retained interest remeasured at fair value. The gain or loss recognized in income includes both the realized gain or loss related to the portion of the ownership interest sold and the gain or loss on the remeasurement to fair value of the retained interest.  We adopted SFAS 160 (ASC 810-10) on Jan. 1, 2009. As a result, effective Jan. 1, 2009, we reclassified $39 million of minority interest liabilities from liabilities to equity on our balance sheet. Noncontrolling interests’ share of the net loss was $2 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Non-controlling interests’ share of net income was $1 million in the first quarter of 2009, $6 million in the second quarter of 2008 and $15 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008.  SFAS No. 141 (revised) (ASC 805-10) – Business Combinations  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (ASC 805-10) (revised 2007) (“SFAS 141 (R)”), “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141 (R) (ASC 805-10) requires all acquisitions of businesses to be measured at the fair value of the net assets acquired rather than the cost allocation process specified in SFAS No. 141 (ASC 805-10). The adoption of SFAS 141(R) (ASC 805-10) did not have a    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 73    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, any business combination entered into beginning in 2009 may significantly impact our financial position and results of operations compared with how it would have been recorded under prior GAAP. Earnings volatility could result, depending on the terms of the acquisition. This statement requires deal costs, such as legal, investment banking, and due diligence costs, to be expensed as incurred and requires contingencies to be measured at fair value. The accounting requirements of SFAS 141(R) (ASC 805-10) are applied on a prospective basis for all transactions completed after the effective date.  FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) EITF 03-6-1 (ASC 260-10) – Participating Securities  In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1 (ASC 260-10), “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”. This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing EPS under the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128 (ASC 260-10). The guidance in this FSP applies to the calculation of EPS under SFAS 128 (ASC 260-10) for share-based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. This FSP was effective Jan. 1, 2009. The adoption of this FSP reduced basic EPS by approximately one cent for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008. All prior period EPS data was adjusted to conform with the provisions of this FSP.  FSP SFAS No. 141 (R)-1(ASC 805-20) – Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combinations that Arise from Contingencies   On April 1, 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 141 (R)-1 (ASC 805-20) (“SFAS 141(R)-1”), “Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies”. SFAS 141(R)-1 (ASC 805-20) amends SFAS 141(R) (ASC 805-10) to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, as   determined in accordance with SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10), if the acquisition-date fair value can be reasonably determined. If the acquisition-date fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably determined, the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized for liabilities in accordance with SFAS 5 (ASC 450-10) and FIN 14 (ASC 450-20). The disclosure requirements of SFAS 141 (R)-1 (ASC 805-20) apply to business combination transactions completed subsequent to Dec. 31, 2008.  SFAS No. 161 (ASC 815-10) – Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161 (ASC 815-10), “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS No. 161 (ASC 815-10) requires entities to disclose the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format and information about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk, and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 (ASC 815-10) and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Note 18 reflects the disclosure requirements of SFAS 161 (ASC 815-10).  FSP No. SFAS 142-3 (ASC 350-30) – Useful Life of Intangible Assets  Effective Jan. 1, 2009, FSP No. SFAS 142-3 (ASC 350-30) (“FSP 142-3”), “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”, amended the factors that should be considered in renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life and initial fair value of recognized intangible assets.  The Company estimates the fair value of intangible assets at acquisition generally on the basis of an income approach using discounted estimated cash flows. For customer relationship and customer contract intangibles, the expected renewals by customers are included in estimating the period over which cash flows will be generated to the Company.    74 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      Estimates of customer renewals are generally based upon the historical information of the acquired intangible assets, and also consider the Company’s own historical experience with similar types of customer relationships and contracts. In the absence of historical information or our own experience, we use assumptions market participants would expect to use consistent with the highest and best use of the assets.  Intangibles are amortized over the periods of and in a pattern that is consistent with the identifiable cash flows, or on a straight-line method over the benefit period if the pattern of cash flows is not estimable.  The initial application of this FSP did not impact the Company as it already considers expected customer renewals or extensions in cash flow estimates used to estimate fair values and useful lives. The Company does not capitalize any costs incurred that may contribute to the renewal or extension of any customer relationship and contract intangibles.  FSP SFAS 115-2 and SFAS 124-2 (ASC 320-10) – Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS 124-2 (ASC 320-10), “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments” (“SFAS 115-2”). This FSP replaced the “intent and ability” indication in current guidance by specifying that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held-to-maturity debt securities, the amount of OTTI recorded in OCI for the non-credit portion of a previous OTTI should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.  SFAS 115-2 (ASC 320-10) requires entities to initially apply the provisions of the standard to previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities (i.e. debt securities that   the entity does not intend to sell and that the entity is not more likely than not required to sell before recovery) existing as of the date of initial adoption by making a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The cumulative-effect adjustment reclassifies the noncredit portion of a previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt security held as of the date of initial adoption to accumulated OCI from retained earnings.  This FSP also amends the disclosure provisions of Statement 115 (ASC 320-10) for both debt and equity securities. The FSP requires disclosures in interim and annual periods for major security types identified on the basis of how an entity manages, monitors and measures its securities and the nature and risks of the security. We adopted SFAS 115-2 (ASC 320-10) effective Jan 1, 2009. As a result of adopting this guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2009 of $676 million (after-tax) to reclassify the non-credit component of the previously recognized OTTI from retained earnings to accumulated OCI (for those securities where management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery).  FSP SFAS 157-4 (ASC 820-10) – Nonactive Markets  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-4 (ASC 820-10), “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That are not Orderly” (“SFAS 157”). This FSP states that the fair value of an asset, when the market is not active, is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, the inactive market). Entities will need to conclude whether a transaction was orderly based on the weight of evidence. When estimating fair value, entities should place more weight on transactions that the company concludes are orderly and less weight on transactions for which the entity does not have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction is orderly. This FSP also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10) to require entities to disclose on interim and annual periods the inputs and valuation techniques used to    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 75    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      measure fair value. We adopted this FSP as of Jan. 1, 2009. As a result of adopting this guidance, the fair value of the Company’s debt securities portfolio, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at June 30, 2009, was measured at $98 (after-tax) higher than if it had not adopted this guidance and relied solely on pricing sources.  FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB No. 28-1 (ASC 825-10) – Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments  In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB No. 28-1 (ASC 825-10), “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“SFAS 107”). This FSP amends SFAS 107 (ASC 825-10) and APB Opinion No. 28 (ASC 270-10) to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. These disclosures were effective June 30, 2009. Note 15 reflects these disclosures requirements.  SFAS No. 165 (ASC 855-10) – Subsequent Events  In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165 (ASC 855-10), “Subsequent Events” (“SFAS 165”). This statement establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. SFAS No. 165 (ASC 855-10) renames type one and type two subsequent events as “recognized” subsequent events and “non-recognized” subsequent events. For recognized subsequent events, an entity shall recognize in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. For unrecognized subsequent events, an entity shall not recognize subsequent events about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but that arose after the balance sheet date. Adoption of SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10) had no impact on our results of operations at June 30, 2009.    Note 3 — Acquisitions and dispositions  There were no material acquisitions or dispositions in the second quarter of 2009.  In July 2009, we reached an agreement to sell MUNB, our national bank subsidiary located in Florida, to Banco Sabadell of Spain. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the first quarter of 2010.  We frequently structure our acquisitions with both an initial payment and later contingent payments tied to post-closing revenue or income growth. We record the fair value of contingent payments as an additional cost of the entity acquired in the period that the payment becomes probable. Contingent payments totaled $16 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $25 million in the first six months of 2009.  At June 30, 2009, we were potentially obligated to pay additional consideration which, using reasonable assumptions for the performance of the acquired companies and joint ventures based on contractual agreements, could range from approximately $110 million to $150 million over the next four years. None of the potential contingent additional consideration was recorded as goodwill at June 30, 2009.  Acquisitions in 2008  In January 2008, we acquired ARX Capital Management (“ARX”). ARX is a leading independent asset management business, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, specializing in Brazilian multi-strategy, long/short and long only investment strategies. The impact of this acquisition was not material to earnings per share.  On Dec. 31, 2008, we acquired the Australian (Ankura Capital) and U.K. (Blackfriars Asset Management) businesses from our Asset Management joint venture with WestLB. The impact of this acquisition is not expected to be material to earnings per share.  Dispositions in 2008  In February 2008, we sold our B-Trade and G-Trade execution businesses to BNY ConvergEx Group. These businesses were sold at book value.    76 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        On March 31, 2008, we sold a portion of the Estabrook Capital Management business which reduced our AUM by $2.4 billion. We retained approximately 30% of the AUM which are primarily managed by the Wealth Management segment.  In June 2008, we sold Mellon 1st Business Bank, based in Los Angeles, California. The sale reduced loan and deposit levels by $1.1 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. There was no gain or loss recorded on this transaction.  On Oct. 1, 2008, we sold the assets of Gannett Welsh & Kotler, an investment management subsidiary with approximately $8 billion in AUM.  Note 4 — Discontinued operations  In July 2009, the Company reached an agreement to sell Mellon United National Bank, our national bank subsidiary located in Florida. As a result, we applied discontinued operations accounting to this business and the income statements for all periods in this Form 10-Q have been restated. This business, which was previously reported in the Other segment, no longer fits our strategic focus on our asset management and securities servicing businesses. The results for discontinued operations   in the second quarter of 2009 include a pre-tax loss on sale of $85 million, primarily attributable to the elimination of $82 million of goodwill.  Summarized financial information for discontinued operations is as follows:            Discontinued operations assets and liabilities (a)   June 30,2009       (in millions)     Cash and due from banks   $ 47     Federal funds sold and securities repurchased under resale agreements     11     Securities     555     Loans     1,585     Allowance for loan losses     (89 )    Net loans     1,496     Premises and equipment     13     Other assets     15     Assets of discontinued operations   $ 2,137     Deposits:        Noninterest-bearing     531     Interest-bearing     883     Total deposits     1,414     Other liabilities     193     Liabilities of discontinued operations   $ 1,607        (a)  Prior period balance sheets, in accordance with GAAP, were not restated for discontinued operations.

Subsequently, if the security is downgraded we do not alter this decision.  EITF 99-20 (ASC 325-40) is an interpretation of SFAS 115 (ASC 320-10) for certain debt securities which are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. Specifically, EITF 99-20 (ASC 325-40) provides incremental impairment guidance for a subset of the debt securities within the scope of SFAS 115 (ASC 320-10). For securities where there is no debt rating at acquisition, and the security is a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets, the Company uses the EITF 99-20 (ASC 325-40) impairment model. For securities where there is no debt rating at acquisition and the security is not a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets the Company uses the SFAS 115 (ASC 320-10) impairment model.  We routinely conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment security to determine whether OTTI has occurred. Economic models are used to determine whether an OTTI has occurred on these securities. While all securities are considered, the securities primarily impacted by OTTI testing are non-agency RMBS and HELOCs. For each non-agency RMBS in the investment portfolio (including but not limited to those whose fair value is less than their amortized cost basis), an extensive, regular review is conducted to determine if an OTTI has occurred. Various inputs to the economic models are used to determine if an unrealized loss on non-agency RMBS is other-than-temporary. The most significant inputs are:      •    Default rate – the number of securities expected to go into default each quarter which is driven by the roll rate of loans in each performance bucket that will migrate to default; and    •    Severity – the loss expected to be realized when a loan defaults  To determine if the unrealized loss for non-agency RMBS is other-than-temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value upon sale in the marketplace (severity) in order to determine the projected collateral loss. We also evaluate the current credit   enhancement underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash flows. If we determine that a given RMBS position will be subject to a write-down or loss, we record the expected credit loss as a charge to earnings.  In the first half of 2009, the housing market indicators and the broader economy continued to deteriorate. To reflect the declining value of homes in the current environment, we adjusted our non-agency RMBS loss severity assumptions to decrease the amount we expect to receive to cover the value of the original loan.  In addition, we have estimated the expected loss by taking into account observed performance of the underlying securities, industry studies, market forecasts, as well as our view of the economic outlook affecting bond collateral.  The table below shows the projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities for recent-vintage (i.e., 2007, 2006 and late 2005) non-agency RMBS portfolios at June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.

The HELOC securities credit enhancement is provided by a combination of excess spread, over-collateralization, subordination, and a note insurance policy provided by a monoline insurer. For the HELOC holdings, the rating is highly dependent upon the rating of the monoline insurance provider.  If a monoline insurer experiences a credit rating downgrade and it is determined that the monoline insurer may not be able to meet its obligations, the HELOC holdings guaranteed by that insurer are further evaluated based on the deal collateral and structure without the insurer guarantee. Potential losses are compared to the available total coverage provided by excess spread, over-collateralization and subordination for each bond to determine OTTI.

In the second quarter and first six months of 2009, we recorded additional charges of $6 million   and $16 million, respectively associated with this workforce reduction.  As of June 30, 2009, we have eliminated approximately 1,300 positions. Severance payments related to these positions are primarily paid over the salary continuance period in accordance with the separation plan. We expect to substantially complete this reduction by the end of 2009.    The following table presents the activity in the restructuring reserve through June 30, 2009.

If these tax reserves were unnecessary, $223 million would affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $84 million. The additional tax expense related to interest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 was $23 million and $38 million, respectively.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 87    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Our federal consolidated income tax returns are closed to examination through 2002. Our New York State and New York City return examinations have been completed through 1996. Our United Kingdom income tax returns are closed through 2002.  Note 14 — Securitizations and variable interest entities  Securitizations  In 2000, we purchased Dreyfus Institutional Reserves Money Fund shares and sold the right to receive the principal value of the shares in 2021 in a securitization transaction and retained the rights to receive the ongoing dividends from the shares.  In 2003, the Company securitized quarterly variable rate municipal bonds, which are Aa3/AAA insured bonds issued by borrowers rated no lower than A2/A+ by Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poors. No gain or loss was recognized on this transaction.  Our retained interests in these securitizations at June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008, are approximately $150 million and $234 million, respectively, which represents our maximum exposure to the securitizations. The Company did not securitize any assets during the first half of 2009.  At June 30, 2009, the Company had no asset-backed commercial paper conduits.  Variable Interest Entities  FIN 46(R) (ASC 810-10), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”) (ASC 810-10) applies to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both, as a result of holding variable interests. The Company is required to consolidate entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.  The Company’s VIEs generally include retail, institutional and alternative investment funds offered to its retail and institutional customers. The Company may provide start-up capital in its   new funds and also earns fund management fees. Performance fees are also earned on certain funds. The Company is not contractually required to provide financial or any other support to its VIEs. In addition, we provide trust and custody services for a fee to entities sponsored by other corporations in which we have no other variable interest.  Primary beneficiary calculations are prepared in accordance with FIN 46(R) (ASC 810-10). This evaluation includes estimates of ranges and probabilities of losses and returns from the funds. The calculated expected gains and expected losses are allocated to the variable interests holders of the funds, which are generally the fund’s investors and may include the Company, in order to determine which entity is required to consolidate the VIE, if any.  The start up capital invested in our Asset Management VIEs as of June 30, 2009 has been included in our financial statements as shown below:                    Other VIEs at June 30, 2009   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Trading   $ 27   $ -   $ 27   Available-for-sale     96     -     96   Other     245     -     245   Total   $ 368   $  -   $ 368                    Other VIEs at Dec. 31, 2008   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Trading   $ 26   $ -   $ 26   Available-for-sale     102     -     102   Other     272     -     272   Total   $ 400   $  -   $ 400  The Company has voluntarily provided limited credit support to certain money market, collective, commingled and separate account funds (the “Funds”). Entering into such support agreements represents an event under FIN 46(R) (ASC 810-10), and its interpretations.  In analyzing the Funds for which credit support was provided, it was determined that interest rate risk and credit risk are the two main risks that the funds are designed to create and pass through to their investors. Accordingly, interest rate and credit risk were analyzed to determine if the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of the Funds.    88 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       Credit risk variability quantification includes any potential future credit risk in a Fund and is evaluated using credit ratings and default rates. The full marks on any sensitive securities on watch are also included.  Interest rate variability quantification includes the expected Fund yield. Standard deviations are used along with the Fund’s market value to quantify the interest rate risk expected in the Fund.  The Company’s analysis of the credit risk variability and interest rate risk variability associated with the supported Funds resulted in the Company not being the primary beneficiary and therefore the Funds were not consolidated.  The table below shows the financial statement items related to non-consolidated VIEs to which we have provided credit support agreements:                    Credit supported VIEs at June 30, 2009   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Other   $  -   $ 182   $ 161                    Credit supported VIEs at Dec. 31, 2008   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Other   $  -   $ 248   $ 142  Certain funds have been created solely with securities that are subject to credit support agreements where we have agreed to absorb the majority of loss. Accordingly, these funds have been consolidated into the Company and have affected the following financial statement items:                    Consolidated VIEs at June 30, 2009   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Available-for-sale   $ 38   $ -   $ 38   Other     -     139     23   Total   $ 38   $ 139   $ 61                  Consolidated VIEs at Dec. 31, 2008   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Available-for-sale   $ 26   $ -   $ 26   Other     24     353     47   Total   $ 50   $ 353   $ 73  The maximum loss exposure shown above for the credit support agreements provided to the Company’s VIEs primarily reflects a complete loss on the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities for the Company’s clients that accepted our offer of support. As of June 30, 2009, the Company recorded $283 million in liabilities related to its VIEs for which credit support agreements were provided.  Note 15 – Fair value of financial instruments  The carrying amounts of our financial instruments (i.e., monetary assets and liabilities) are determined under different accounting methods—see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following disclosure discusses these instruments on a uniform fair value basis. However, active markets do not exist for a significant portion of these instruments, principally loans and commitments. As a result, fair value determinations require significant subjective judgments regarding future cash flows. Other judgments would result in different fair values. Among the assumptions we used are discount rates ranging principally from 0.18% to 5.68% at June 30, 2009 and 0.08% to 3.25% at Dec. 31, 2008. The fair value information supplements the basic financial statements and other traditional financial data presented throughout this report.  Note 16, “Fair value measurement” presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value by the three level valuation hierarchy established by SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10), as well as a roll forward schedule of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs. Note 17, “Fair value option” presents the instruments for which fair value accounting was elected and the corresponding income statement impact of these instruments.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 89    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       A summary of the practices used for determining fair value is as follows.  Interest-bearing deposits in banks  The fair value of interest-bearing deposits in banks is based on discounted cash flows.  Securities, trading activities, and derivatives used for ALM  The fair value of securities and trading assets and liabilities is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or pricing models. Fair value amounts for derivative instruments, such as options, futures and forward rate contracts, commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange, and foreign currency swaps, are similarly determined. The fair value of over-the-counter interest rate swaps is the discounted value of projected future cash flows, adjusted for other factors including, but not limited to and if applicable, optionality and implied volatilities, as well as counterparty credit.  Loans and commitments  For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, adjusting where appropriate for prepayment estimates, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and maturities to borrowers. Discounted future cash flows are used to determine the fair value of other types of loans. The fair value of commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is based upon the cost to settle the commitment.  Other financial assets  Fair value is assumed to equal carrying value for these assets due to their short maturity.  Deposits, borrowings and long-term debt  The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits and payables to customers and broker-dealers is assumed to be their carrying amount. The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and long-term debt is based upon current rates for instruments of the same remaining maturity or quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.

SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. It establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and expands the disclosures about instruments measured at fair value. SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10) requires consideration of a company’s own creditworthiness when valuing liabilities.  Effective Jan. 1, 2009, we adopted SFAS 157-4 (ASC 820-10), “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly”. SFAS 157-4 (ASC 820-10) provides guidance on how to determine the fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price notion. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10). It also requires additional disclosures for instruments within the scope of SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10) to include inputs and valuation techniques used, change in valuation techniques and related inputs, if any, and more disaggregated information relating to debt and equity securities.  The amended standard provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of   significant judgment. The objective is to determine from weighted indicators of fair value a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.  We also adopted SFAS 159 (ASC 825-10) (“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”), effective Jan. 1, 2008. SFAS 159 (ASC 825-10) provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement basis for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments and written loan commitments which are not subject to fair value under other accounting standards.  Determination of fair value  Following is a description of our valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. We have established processes for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. For financial instruments where quotes from recent exchange transactions are not available, we determine fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis, comparison to similar instruments, and the use of financial models. Discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates. Model-based pricing uses inputs of observable prices for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, option volatilities and other factors. Models are benchmarked and validated by an independent internal risk management function. Our valuation process takes into consideration factors such as counterparty credit quality, liquidity, concentration concerns, observability of model parameters and the results of stress tests. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value.  Most derivative contracts are valued using internally developed models which are calibrated to observable market data and employ standard market pricing theory for their valuations. An initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each position assuming time-discounting based on an AA credit curve. Then, to arrive at a fair value that incorporates counterparty credit risk, a credit adjustment is made to these results by discounting each trade’s expected exposures to the counterparty using the counterparty’s credit spreads, as implied by the credit default swap market. We also adjust expected liabilities to the counterparty using the Company’s    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 91    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      own credit spreads, also implied by the credit default swap market. Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative position is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit spreads as well as those of our counterparties.  In certain cases, we may face additional costs to exit large risk positions or recent prices may not be observable for instruments that trade in inactive or less active markets. The costs to exit large risk positions are based on evaluating the negative change in the market during the time it would take for us to bring those positions to normal market levels for those instruments. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we make an adjustment to their value. The determination of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of external quotes, the time since the latest available quote and the price volatility of the instrument.  Certain parameters in some financial models are not directly observable and, therefore, are based on managements’ estimates and judgments. These financial instruments are normally traded less actively. Examples include certain credit products where parameters such as correlation and recovery rates are unobservable. We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate the possibility of error and revision in the model based estimate value.  The methods described above may produce a current fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our methods of determining fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. However, the use of different methodologies or different assumptions to value certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.  Valuation hierarchy  SFAS 157 (ASC 820-10) establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are described below.  Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and  liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative financial instruments actively traded on exchanges and U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government securities that are actively traded in highly liquid over the counter markets.  Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, for example, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable or can be corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments that are traded less frequently than exchange traded securities and derivative instruments whose model inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market observable data. Examples in this category are certain variable and fixed rate agency and non-agency securities, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts.  Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Examples in this category include interests in certain securitized financial assets, non-agency RMBS, certain private equity investments, and derivative contracts that are highly structured or long-dated.  A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments  Where quoted market prices are not available, we generally base the fair value of loans and unfunded lending-related commitments on observable market prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit derivatives and loans with similar characteristics. If observable market prices are not available, we base the fair value on estimated cash flows adjusted for credit risk which are discounted using an interest rate appropriate for the maturity of the applicable loans or the unfunded commitments.    92 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       Loans carried at fair value are included in trading assets on the balance sheet. Unrealized gains and losses on unfunded lending commitments carried at fair value are classified in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively. Loans and unfunded lending commitments carried at fair value are generally classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Securities  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, we classify the securities within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Securities are defined as both long and short positions. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds, certain mortgage products and exchange-traded equities.  If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair values using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include certain agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and European floating rate notes.  For securities where quotes from recent transactions are not available for identical securities, we determine fair value primarily based on pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency that employ financial models or obtain comparison to similar instruments to arrive at “consensus” prices.  Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., vintage, position in the securitization structure) and ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of prepayment for the types of transaction and apply such variables to similar types of bonds. We view these as observable transactions in the current market place and classify such securities as Level 2. They discontinue pricing any specific security whenever they determine there is insufficient observable data to provide a good faith opinion on price.  Securities included in this category that are affected by the lack of market liquidity include our Alt-A RMBS, prime RMBS, subprime RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities.    In addition, we have significant investments in more actively traded agency RMBS and the pricing sources derive the prices for these securities largely from quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily observed trade price and other information feeds from the interdealer brokers.  For securities with bond insurance, the financial strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that information is included in the fair value assessment for such securities.  In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, we classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Securities classified within Level 3 include certain asset-backed securities CDOs, non-agency RMBS and other retained interests in securitizations.  In the first quarter of 2009, we changed our valuation technique in determining the fair value of certain securities when there has been a significant decline in volume and market activity.  Recent transactions in non-agency RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities may not reflect an orderly transaction in the marketplace. In adopting the guidance of SFAS 157-4 (ASC 820-10), for these securities, we adjust the discount rate to reflect “an orderly transaction” in the current marketplace. We used a discount rate that was determined based on our assessment of the credit quality of the non-agency RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The discount rate was derived based on input from market participants as to the appropriate discount rate for hypothetical bond issuances that exhibit certain credit features similar to the bonds we hold.  To further reflect current market conditions, we weighted our internally modeled price with prices derived from pricing sources to calculate the fair market value in an orderly transaction. Depending on credit quality, the price weighting of the security ranged from 5% pricing source and 95% model to 85% pricing source and 15% model.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 93    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Other short-term U.S. government-backed commercial paper and borrowings from Federal Reserve related to asset-backed commercial paper  These instruments are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair value of these instruments is estimated using pricing models.  Derivatives  We classify exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples include exchanged-traded equity and foreign exchange options. Since few other classes of derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, most of our derivative positions are valued using internally developed models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters and we classify them in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic interest rate swaps and options and credit default swaps. Derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable market parameters and that are traded less actively or in markets that lack two way flow, are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples include long-dated interest rate or currency swaps, where swap rates may be unobservable for longer maturities; and certain credit products, where correlation and recovery rates are unobservable. Additional disclosures of derivative instruments are provided in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Seed capital  In our Asset Management segment we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, money market and alternative investment funds for institutions and other investors; as part of that activity we make seed capital investments in certain funds. Seed capital is included in trading assets, securities available-for-sale and other assets, depending on the nature of the investment. When applicable, we value seed capital based on the published net asset value (“NAV”) of the fund. We include funds in which ownership interests in the fund are publicly-traded in an active market and institutional funds in which investors trade in and out daily in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. We include open-end funds where investors are allowed to sell their ownership interest back to the fund less frequently than daily and where our interest in the fund contains no other rights or obligations   in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. However, we generally include investments in funds which allow investors to sell their ownership interest back to the fund less frequently than monthly in Level 3, unless actual redemption prices are observable.  For other types of investments in funds, we consider all of the rights and obligations inherent in our ownership interest, including the reported NAV as well as other factors that affect the fair value of our interest in the fund. To the extent the NAV measurements reported for the investments are based on unobservable inputs or include other rights and obligations (e.g., obligation to meet cash calls), we generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Certain interests in securitizations  For certain interests in securitizations which are classified in securities available-for-sale and other assets, we use discounted cash flow models which generally include assumptions of projected finance charges related to the securitized assets, estimated net credit losses, prepayment assumptions and estimates of payments to third-party investors. When available, we compare our fair value estimates and assumptions to market activity and to the actual results of the securitized portfolio. Changes in these assumptions may significantly impact our estimate of fair value of the interests in securitizations; accordingly, we generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Private equity investments   Our Other segment includes holdings of nonpublic private equity investment through funds managed by third party investment managers and, to a lesser extent, direct investment in private equities. Nonpublic private equity investments generally lack quoted market prices, are less liquid and may be long term; accordingly, we must apply significant judgment in determining their fair value. We value private equity investments initially based upon the transaction price which we subsequently adjust to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or through ongoing reviews by the investment managers.  The investment managers consider a number of factors in changes in valuation including current    94 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, industry valuations of comparable public companies, changes in market outlook and the financing environment. Nonpublic private equity investments are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Private equity investments also include publicly held equity investments, generally obtained through the initial public offering of privately held equity investments. Publicly held investments are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less adjustments for regulatory or contractual sales restrictions.    Discounts for restrictions are quantified by analyzing the length of the restriction period and the volatility of the equity security. Publicly held investments are primarily classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Changes in Level 3 fair value measurements  The tables below include a roll forward of the balance sheet amounts for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 (including the change in fair value), for financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Our classification of a financial instrument in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is based on the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, these instruments generally include other observable components that are actively quoted or validated to third party sources; accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due to observable parameters as well as   the unobservable parameters in our valuation methodologies. We also frequently manage the risks of Level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivatives positions that are Level 1 or 2 instruments which are not included in the table; accordingly, the gains or losses below do not reflect the effect of our risk management activities related to the Level 3 instruments.  In accordance with SFAS 157-4 (ASC 820-10), the Company adjusts the discount rate on securities to reflect what they would sell for in an orderly market (model price) and compares the model prices to prices provided by pricing sources. If the difference between the model price and the prices provided by pricing sources is outside of established thresholds, the securities are included in Level 3. In the second    96 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       quarter of 2009, the Company transferred securities from Level 3 to Level 2 because the price of the securities provided by the pricing sources began to converge with the model price of the securities determined by the Company.

An example would be the recording of an   impairment of an asset. The following table presents the financial instruments carried on the consolidated balance sheet by caption and by level in the fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.    98 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)                          Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2009 (in millions)   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Totalcarrying value      Loans (a)   $ -   $ 43   $ 214   $ 257   Other assets (b)     -     5     -     5      Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   $ -   $ 48   $ 214   $ 262                           Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at Dec. 31, 2008 (in millions)   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Totalcarrying value      Loans (a)   $ 14   $ 43   $ 161   $ 218   Other assets (b)     -     6     -     6      Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   $ 14   $ 49   $ 161   $ 224         (a)  During the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008, the fair value of these loans was reduced $55 million and $35 million, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral as allowed by SFAS 114 (ASC 310-10), Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a loan, with an offset to the allowance for credit losses.     (b)  Other assets received in satisfaction of debt. The fair value of these assets was reduced $16 million in the second quarter of 2009 and was reduced $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral with an offset in other revenue.    Note 17 – Fair value option  SFAS 159 (ASC 825-10) provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value.  At Dec. 31, 2008, $5.6 billion of other short-term U.S. government-backed commercial paper and $5.6 billion of borrowings from Federal Reserve related to asset-backed commercial paper were held at fair value. There were no balances outstanding for these instruments at June 30, 2009.  Changes in fair value under the fair value option election  The following table presents the changes in fair value included in foreign exchange and other trading activities in the consolidated income statement for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008.

The contractual amount of such commitments was $110 million at both June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.    Note 18 – Derivative instruments  We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk, to generate profits from proprietary trading and to assist customers with their risk management objectives.  The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments express the dollar volume of the transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and enter into netting agreements to minimize the credit risk of foreign    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 99    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       currency and interest rate risk management products. We enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.  Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were no counterparty default losses in the first half of 2009.  Hedging derivatives  We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For hedges of fixed-rate loans, asset-backed securities, deposits and long-term debt, the hedge documentation specifies the terms of the hedged items and the interest rate swaps and indicates that the derivative is hedging a fixed-rate item and is a fair value hedge, that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark interest rates, and that the strategy is to eliminate fair value variability by converting fixed-rate interest payments to LIBOR.  The fixed rate loans hedged generally have an original maturity of 10 to 11 years and are not callable. These loans are hedged with “pay fixed rate, receive variable rate” swaps with similar notional amounts, maturities, and fixed rate coupons. The swaps are not callable. At June 30, 2009, $2 million of loans were hedged with interest rate swaps, which had notional values of $2 million.  The securities hedged generally have a weighted average life of 10 years or less and are callable six months prior to maturity. These securities are hedged with “pay fixed rate, receive variable rate” swaps of like maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon. The swaps are callable six months prior to maturity. At June 30, 2009, $214 million of securities were hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $214 million.  The fixed rate deposits hedged generally have original maturities of 5 to 11 years and are not callable. These deposits are hedged with receive fixed rate, pay variable rate swaps of similar maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon. The swaps are not callable. At June 30, 2009, $30 million of deposits were hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $30 million.  The fixed rate long-term debt hedged generally has an original maturity of 5 to 30 years. We issue both callable and non-callable debt. The non-callable debt is hedged with simple interest rate swaps similar to those described for deposits. Callable debt is hedged with callable swaps where the call dates of the swaps exactly match the call dates of the debt. At June 30, 2009, $11.7 billion of debt was hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $11.3 billion.  In addition, we enter into foreign exchange hedges. We use forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge our Sterling, Euro and Indian Rupee foreign exchange exposure with respect to forecasted revenue transactions in non-U.S. entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of June 30, 2009, the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions and linked FX forward hedges were $61 million, with $2 million (pre-tax) of losses recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains are expected to be reclassified to income over the next nine months.  We also use forward foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of 10 months or less to hedge our Euro and Japanese Yen foreign exchange exposure with respect to forecasted foreign currency net revenue where we cannot elect hedge accounting. At June 30, 2009, these economic hedges had a U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of $34 million, with $3.0 million (pre-tax) of losses from those FX forward hedges recorded in foreign exchange and other trading activities.  Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts usually have maturities of less than two years. The derivatives employed are designated as net investments hedges of changes in value of our foreign investments due to exchange rates, such that changes in value of the forward exchange contracts offset the changes in value of the foreign investments due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The change in fair market    100 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        value of these contracts is deferred and reported within accumulated translation adjustments in shareholders’ equity, net of tax effects. At June 30, 2009, foreign exchange contracts, with notional amounts totaling $3.7 billion, were designated as hedges.  In addition to forward foreign exchange contracts, we also designate non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Those non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries were all long-term liabilities of the Company in various currencies, and, at June 30, 2009, had a combined U.S. dollar equivalent value of $899 million.

  $ -   Other revenue   $ 0.1   $ (0.1 )     Trading activities (including trading derivatives)  Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market maker for our customers. The risk from these market-making activities and from our own positions is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure as described below.  We manage trading risk through a system of position limits, a value-at-risk (“VAR”) methodology based on Monte Carlo simulations, stop loss advisory triggers, and other market sensitivity measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a separate unit on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VAR methodology is designed to   capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding period for most instruments, utilizes a 99% confidence level, and incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options. The VAR model is the basis for the economic capital calculation, which is allocated to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted performance.  As the VAR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences, the risk assessment process includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio and management’s    102 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      assessment of market conditions. Additional stress scenarios based upon historic market events are also performed. Stress tests, by their design, incorporate the impact of reduced liquidity and the breakdown of observed correlations. The results of these stress tests are reviewed weekly with senior management.  Revenue from foreign exchange and other trading activities included the following:      Foreign exchange and other trading activities                                Quarter ended     Six months ended    (in millions)   June 30,2009     March 31,2009     June 30,2008     June 30,2009     June 30,2008     Foreign exchange   $ 240     $ 219     $ 259     $ 459     $ 486     Fixed income     37       75       48       112       59     Credit derivatives     (45 )      (1 )      (20 )      (46 )      (19 )    Other     5       14       21       19       41     Total   $ 237     $ 307     $ 308     $ 544     $ 567    Foreign exchange includes income from purchasing and selling foreign exchange, futures, and options. Fixed income reflects results from futures and forward contracts, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, options and fixed income securities. Credit derivatives include revenue from credit default swaps. Other primarily includes income from equity securities and equity derivatives.  Counterparty credit risk and collateral  We assess credit risk of our counterparties through regular periodic examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information. This and other information is used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to assess credit quality.    Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality of each counterparty. Collateral is generally held in the form of cash or highly liquid government securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.  Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Disclosure of Contingent Features in Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Derivative Instruments  Certain of the Company’s OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements contain provisions that would require the Company to take certain actions if its public debt rating fell to a certain level. A “close-out” agreement could trigger an immediate closeout and payment of outstanding contracts that are in net liability positions. Certain collateral agreements would require the Company to immediately post additional collateral to cover some or all of the Company’s liabilities to a counterparty.  The following table shows the fair value of contracts falling under close-out agreements that were in net liability positions as of June 30, 2009 for three key ratings triggers           If the Company’s rating was changed to   Potential close-outexposures (fair value)   A3/A-   $373 million   Baa2/BBB   $524 million   Bal/BB+   $948 million  Additionally, if the Company’s debt rating had fallen below investment grade on June 30, 2009, existing collateral arrangements would have required the Company to have posted an additional $562 million of collateral.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 103    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       Note 19 – Commitments and contingent liabilities  In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management products, commercial lending commitments, letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications. We assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity needs, to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks, and to trade for our own account. These items involve, to varying degrees, credit, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk not recognized in the balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar to those used for on-balance-sheet risks.

A summary of our off-balance sheet credit transactions, net of participations, at June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008 follows:               Off-balance sheet credit risks (in millions)   June 30,2009   Dec. 31,2008   Lending commitments (a)   $ 34,706   $ 38,822   Standby letters of credit (b)     12,394     13,084   Commercial letters of credit     940     705   Securities lending indemnifications     289,864     325,975   Support agreements     266     244      (a)  Net of participations totaling $789 million at June 30, 2009 and $986 million at Dec. 31, 2008.    (b)  Net of participations totaling $2.7 billion at both June 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.  Included in lending commitments are facilities which provide liquidity, primarily for variable rate tax exempt securities wrapped by monoline insurers. The credit approval for these facilities is based on an assessment of the underlying tax-exempt issuer and considers factors other than the financial strength of the monoline insurer.  The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any collateral.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The allowance for lending related commitments was $92 million at June 30, 2009 and $114 million at Dec. 31, 2008. A summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows: $12 billion less than one year; $22 billion in one to five years, and $1 billion over five years.  Standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) principally support corporate obligations. As shown in the off-balance sheet credit risks table, the maximum potential exposure of SBLCs at June 30, 2009 was $12.4 billion and at Dec. 31, 2008 was $13.1 billion and includes $1.0 billion that were collateralized with cash and securities on June 30, 2009 and $1.1 billion on Dec. 31, 2008. At June 30, 2009, approximately $7.5 billion of the SBLCs will expire within one year and the remaining $4.9 billion will expire within one to five years.  The estimated liability for losses related to these commitments and SBLCs, if any, is included in the allowance for lending related commitments.    104 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings criteria. The Company’s historical experience is that SBLCs typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below investment grade are monitored closely for payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs by investment grade:              Standby letters of credit   June 30,2009     Dec. 31,2008     Investment grade   87 %    89 %    Noninvestment grade   13     11 %   A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon), to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a prearranged contract, which generally matures in less than 90 days. We generally lend securities with indemnification against broker default. We generally require the borrower to provide 102% cash collateral which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Security lending transactions are generally entered into only with highly-rated counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of $313 billion at June 30, 2009 and $335 billion at Dec. 31, 2008.  Our potential exposure to support agreements was approximately $266 million at June 30, 2009 compared with $244 million at Dec. 31, 2008. Potential support agreement exposure is determined based on the securities subject to these agreements being valued at zero and the NAV of the related funds declining below established thresholds. This exposure includes agreements covering Lehman securities, as well as other client support agreements.  Other  We have provided standard representations for underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other similar types of arrangements and customary indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to providing financial services. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of these risks.   We are a minority equity investor in, and member of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges through which foreign exchange, securities, or other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing or settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities or to provide financial support in the event other partners do not honor their obligations. It is not possible to estimate a maximum potential amount of payments that could be required with such agreements.  Legal Proceedings  In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, and regulatory matters. Claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties and/or other remedial sanctions are possible. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, the Company cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be; however, on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters, either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company, although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 8-K dated May 17, 2007, the Federal Customs Service of the Russian Federation is pursuing a claim against The Bank of New York, now The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Bank”), a subsidiary of the Company. The claim is based on allegations relating to the previously disclosed Russian funds transfer matter, and alleges that the Bank violated U.S. law by failing to supervise and monitor funds transfer activities at the Bank. This “lack of action” is alleged to have resulted in underpayment to the Russian Federation of the value added taxes that were due to be paid by    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 105    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        the customers of the bank’s clients on certain goods imported into the country. The claim seeks $22.5 billion in “direct and indirect” losses.  The Bank has been defending itself vigorously in this matter and intends to continue to do so. The Bank believes it has meritorious procedural and substantive defenses to the allegations in the Russian courts and also believes it has meritorious defenses to an attempted enforcement of a judgment outside the Russian Federation in countries in which the Bank has material assets if a judgment were to be entered in this matter by the Russian courts. The Bank has engaged in settlement discussions with representatives of the Customs Service and has indicated that the Bank is willing to accept a reasonable resolution of this matter, which reflects its lack of merit. There can be no assurance that a resolution will be reached.  As previously disclosed, the Bank filed a proof of claim on Jan. 18, 2008, in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Sentinel Management Group, Inc. (“Sentinel”), seeking to recover approximately $312 million loaned to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an account maintained by Sentinel at the Bank. Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on Dec. 8, 2008, $370 million of cash has been set aside as a reserve, to be used by the Bank if its proof of claim is allowed in the bankruptcy. On March 3, 2008, the bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary complaint against the Company seeking to disallow the Bank’s claim and seeking damages against the Bank for allegedly aiding and abetting Sentinel insiders in misappropriating customer assets and improperly using them as collateral for the loan. The Company has learned from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) that it has opened an investigation of the Bank in connection with its relationship to Sentinel.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is investigating the trading activities of Pershing Trading Company LP (“Pershing”), a floor specialist, on two regional exchanges from 1999 to 2004.  As previously disclosed, in connection with the acquired JPMorgan Chase corporate trust business, the Bank was required to file various IRS information and withholding tax returns for 2006. In preparing to do so, the Bank identified   certain inconsistencies in the supporting tax documentation and records transferred to the Bank that were needed to file accurate returns. The Company was informed in the second quarter of 2009 by JPMorgan Chase that all issues concerning 2006 had been resolved with the IRS. Accordingly, the Company has no further exposure for potential tax reporting deficiencies attributable to the 2006 JPMorgan Chase corporate trust business.  As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we also discovered that other business lines, including the legacy The Bank of New York corporate trust business, may have similar issues and initiated an extensive company-wide review to identify any inconsistencies in the supporting tax documentation. Any deficiencies that are identified will be promptly remediated. We made an initial disclosure of this matter to the IRS on a voluntary basis in the fourth quarter of 2007 and we continue to work diligently with the IRS to help resolve the matter. The Company recorded a $13 million reserve as of June 30, 2009 which represents its estimate of the potential exposure from tax reporting inconsistencies based on the remediation status and discussions with the IRS to date.  As previously disclosed, during 2001 and 2002, we entered into various structured transactions that involved, among other things, the payment of U.K. corporate income taxes that were credited against our U.S. corporate income tax liability.  On Sept. 30, 2008, as part of our closing agreement for the 1998-2002 federal audit cycle, the IRS designated one such transaction for litigation and we agreed to litigate in the U.S. Tax Court.  The transaction involved payments of U.K. corporate income taxes that generated foreign tax credits over the 2001-2006 period. The IRS has indicated it intends to seek to disallow the foreign tax credits primarily on the basis the transaction lacked economic substance. We are prepared to vigorously defend our position.  While we have not yet received a statutory notice of deficiency, during the second quarter of 2009 we deposited approximately $800 million with the IRS to mitigate interest costs that could arise with this disputed tax assessment. The Company believes the tax benefits associated with the transaction were    106 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        consistent with IRS published guidance existing at the time the transaction was entered into and with various federal appellate court decisions. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, the IRS has agreed not to assess underpayment penalties on this transaction.  Based on a probability assessment of various potential outcomes, we currently believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the tax liabilities are made when appropriate.  As previously disclosed, the Company self-disclosed to the SEC that Mellon Financial Markets LLC (“MFM”) placed orders on behalf of issuers to purchase their own Auction Rate Securities. The SEC and certain state authorities, including the Texas State Securities Board, Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the New York Attorney General are investigating these transactions. MFM is cooperating fully with the investigations.  As previously disclosed, the Company became aware of circumstances suggesting that employees of Mellon Securities LLC (“Mellon Securities”), which executes orders to purchase and sell securities on behalf of Mellon Investor Services LLC, failed to comply with certain best execution and regulatory requirements in connection with agency cross trades. The Company self-disclosed this matter to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and the SEC on a voluntary basis. In June 2009, the SEC obtained a formal order of investigation. Mellon Securities is cooperating fully with the investigation.  As previously disclosed, in April 2009, BNY MCM entered into a letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent with FINRA relating to the sale of Auction Rate Securities (“ARS”). Two institutional customers not included in the FINRA settlement have filed lawsuits and one such customer has filed an arbitration proceeding against BNY MCM, alleging misrepresentations and omissions in the sale of ARS to them.  A number of participants in the securities lending program, which is associated with the Company’s asset servicing business, have filed or threatened lawsuits against the Company or its affiliates. The participants allege that they have incurred losses, including losses related to investments in   Sigma Finance Inc., and seek damages as to those losses. Certain of these cases seek to proceed as class actions. The participants assert contractual, statutory, and common law claims, including claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.  Bernard L. Madoff has pleaded guilty to engaging in a massive investment fraud through his company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“Madoff”). As previously disclosed, the Company has no direct exposure to the Madoff fraud. Ivy Asset Management LLC (“Ivy”), a subsidiary that primarily manages funds-of-hedge-funds, has not had any funds-of-funds investments with Madoff since 2000. Several investment managers contracted with Ivy as a sub-advisor and one pension fund contracted with Ivy as investment manager; a portion of these funds were invested with Madoff and likely suffered losses as a result of the Madoff fraud.  The Company and its affiliates, including Ivy, have received subpoenas and document requests in connection with a number of regulatory inquiries regarding Madoff and have been cooperating with these inquiries.  The Company or its affiliates have been named in several civil lawsuits relating to certain investment funds that invested money with Madoff. Ivy acted as a sub-advisor to the managers of some of those funds. Plaintiffs allege that the funds suffered losses in connection with the Madoff investments. Plaintiffs assert various causes of action against the Company or its affiliates, and other parties, including securities and common-law fraud. Certain of the cases seek to proceed as class actions and/or to assert derivative claims on behalf of the funds.  Note 20 – Business segments  Business segments accounting principles  Our segment data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting principles used for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the segments will track their economic performance.  Segment results are subject to reclassification whenever improvements are made in the    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 107    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        measurement principles or when organizational changes are made.  The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that other fee revenue and net interest revenue differ from the amounts shown in the Consolidated Income Statement because amounts presented in Business segments are on an FTE basis.    In the second quarter of 2009, the financial results of MUNB were moved from the Other segment into discontinued operations. Historical results in the Other segment have been restated.  The operations of acquired businesses are integrated with the existing business segments soon after most acquisitions are completed. As a result of the integration of staff support functions, management of customer relationships, operating processes and the financial impact of funding acquisitions, we cannot precisely determine the impact of acquisitions on income before taxes and therefore do not report it.    We provide segment data for seven segments, with certain segments combined into sector groupings as shown below.          Sector/Segment   Primary types of revenue   Asset and Wealth Management sector       Asset Management segment    • Asset and wealth management fees from: Mutual funds Institutional clients Private clients  Performance fees • Distribution and servicing fees   Wealth Management segment    • Wealth management fees from high-net-worth individuals and families, family offices and business enterprises, charitable gift programs, and foundations and endowments   Institutional Services sector       Asset Servicing segment    • Asset servicing fees, including: Institutional trust and custody fees Broker-dealer services Securities lending • Foreign exchange   Issuer Services segment    • Issuer services fees, including: Corporate trust Depositary receipts Employee investment plan services Shareowner services   Clearing Services segment    • Clearing services fees, including broker-dealer and registered investment advisor services   Treasury Services segment    • Treasury services fees, including: Global payment services Working capital solutions • Financing-related fees   Other segment    • Leasing operations • Corporate treasury activities • Global markets and institutional banking services • Business exits • M&I expenses    108 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       Business segment information is reported on a continuing operations basis for all periods presented. See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of discontinued operations.  The results of our business segments are presented and analyzed on an internal management reporting basis:      •    Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue generated by each segment. Fee and other revenue transferred between segments under revenue transfer agreements is included within other revenue in each segment.    •    Revenues and expenses associated with specific client bases are included in those segments. For example, foreign exchange activity associated with clients using custody products is allocated to the Asset Servicing segment.    •    Net interest revenue is allocated to segments based on the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each segment. We employ a funds transfer pricing system that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities of each segment based on their interest sensitivity and maturity characteristics.    •    The measure of revenues and pre-tax profit or loss by a segment has been adjusted to present segment data on an FTE basis.    •    Support and other indirect expenses are allocated to segments based on internally-developed methodologies.    •    The FDIC special emergency deposit assessment is considered a corporate charge and was therefore recorded in the Other segment. Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to segments based on average deposits generated within each segment.    •    Support agreement charges are recorded in the segment in which the charges occurred.    •    Restructuring charges are a result of corporate initiatives and therefore are recorded in the Other segment.    •    Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related income or expense are specifically assigned to each segment. Segments with a net liability position have been allocated assets.    •    Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within individual business segments.  The following consolidating schedules show the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.

Controls and Procedures      Disclosure controls and procedures  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our ethics hotline can also be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.    As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  Changes in internal control over financial reporting  In the ordinary course of business, we may routinely modify, upgrade or enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the second quarter of 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 111    Table of Contents  Forward-looking Statements      Some statements in this document are forward-looking. These include all statements about the future results of the Company; areas of our business expected to be impacted by the current market environment; the impact of changes in the value of market indices; factors affecting the performance of our segments; the effect of economic conditions on goodwill and intangible assets; management’s judgment in determining the size of unallocated allowances and the effect of credit ratings on allowances, estimates and cash flow models. In addition, these forward-looking statements relate to: our strategic focus, including the planned sale of Mellon United National Bank; the expected increase in the percentage of revenue and income from outside the U.S.; targeted capital ratios; the FDIC’s extension of certain programs created to address market events and expenses incurred with respect to these programs; deposit levels; our decision to reduce cash held at central banks and invest in certain types of securities; expectations with respect to earnings per share; statements with respect to the value of our securities portfolio and our intent to hold securities until maturity; assumptions with respect to residential mortgage-backed securities; expected losses included in securities write-downs and impairments; statements on our institutional credit strategies; goals with respect to our commercial portfolio; trends in the real estate market; descriptions of our allowance for credit losses and loan losses; expectations with respect to the increase in nonperforming assets; descriptions of our exposure to support agreements; statements with respect to our liquidity targets, including the effect of reductions in securities servicing; access to capital markets; expectations with respect to capital, including anticipated repayment and call of outstanding debt and issuance of replacement securities; timing and impact of adoption of recent accounting pronouncements; the materiality of acquisitions; the timing of our reductions in workforce; amount of dividends bank subsidiaries can pay without regulatory waiver; the expected outcome and impact of judgments and settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings, including the claims raised by The Federal Customs Service of the Russian Federation.  In this report, any other report, any press release or any written or oral statement that the Company or its executives may make, words, such as “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,”   “confident,” “target,” “expect,” “intend,” “seek,” “believe,” “plan,” “goal,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “strategy,” “synergies,” “opportunities,” “trends” and words of similar meaning, signify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, as well as other uncertainties affecting future results and the value of the Company’s stock and factors which represents risk associated with the business and operations of the Company, can be found in Risk Factors in the Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and any subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Forward-looking statements, including discussions and projections of future results of operations and discussions of future plans contained in the MD&A, are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions that involve risk and uncertainties and that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company’s control), including adverse changes in market conditions, and the timing of such changes, and the actions that management could take in response to these changes. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties and the risks and uncertainties described in the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Risk Factors discussed in the Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 could cause or contribute to such differences. Investors should consider all risks mentioned elsewhere in this document and in subsequent reports filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, as well as other uncertainties affecting future results and the value of the Company’s stock.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.    112 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Part II — Other Information           Item 1. Legal Proceedings  In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, and regulatory matters. Claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties and/or other remedial sanctions are possible. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, the Company cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be; however, on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters, either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company, although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions.  See the “Legal proceedings” section in Note 19 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which portion is incorporated by reference in response to this item.  Item 2.
