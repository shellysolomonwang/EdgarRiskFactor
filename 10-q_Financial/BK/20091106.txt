(c)  Includes support agreement charges of $726 million in the third quarter of 2008 and $731 million in the first nine months of 2008.    (d)  Basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method were calculated after deducting earnings allocated to participating securities of $- million in the third quarter of 2009, $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2009, $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2008, $- million in the first nine months of 2009 and $9.9 million in the first nine months of 2008.

Adding back the dilutive shares would result in anti-dilution.    (g)  Represents stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, participating securities and warrants outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted average common shares because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    66 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 1 — Basis of presentation    The accounting and financial reporting policies of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a global financial services company, conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing industry practices. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based upon assumptions about future economic and market conditions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that in the near term, actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Amounts subject to significant estimates are items such as the allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and post-retirement obligations, the fair value of financial instruments and other-than-temporary impairments. Among other effects, such changes could result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets and establishment of allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments as well as increased pension and post-retirement expense.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been made. Certain other immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with current period presentation. We have evaluated events occurring subsequent to Sept. 30, 2009 for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements through Nov. 6, 2009.  Note 2 — Accounting changes and new accounting guidance  Noncontrolling Interests and Selected Implementation Questions  In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on noncontrolling interests included in ASC 810 – Consolidation. This amends previous guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the   noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (i.e., minority interest) and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements. This guidance clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is part of the equity of the controlling group and is reported on the balance sheet within the equity section separately from BNY Mellon’s equity as a distinct item. The equity section of the balance sheet is required to present equity attributable to both controlling and noncontrolling interests. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in ownership interest, and any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity attributable to the noncontrolling interest (i.e., as additional paid in capital). Any transaction that results in the loss of control of a subsidiary is considered a remeasurement event with any retained interest remeasured at fair value. The gain or loss recognized in income includes both the realized gain or loss related to the portion of the ownership interest sold and the gain or loss on the remeasurement to fair value of the retained interest.  We adopted this guidance on Jan. 1, 2009. As a result, effective Jan. 1, 2009, we reclassified $39 million of minority interest from liabilities to equity on our balance sheet. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1 million in the third quarter of 2009. There was no net income or loss related to noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, net loss related to the noncontrolling interests was $2 million. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $4 million in the third quarter of 2008 and $19 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008.  Business Combinations  In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on business combinations included in ASC 805 – Business Combinations. This guidance requires all acquisitions of businesses to be measured at the fair value of the net assets acquired rather than the cost allocation process specified in previous guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, any business combination entered into beginning in 2009 may significantly    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 67    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      impact our financial position and results of operations compared with how it would have been recorded under prior GAAP. Earnings volatility could result, depending on the terms of the acquisition. This statement requires transaction costs, such as legal, investment banking, and due diligence costs, to be expensed as incurred and requires earn out contingencies to be measured at fair value. The accounting requirements of this guidance are applied on a prospective basis for all transactions completed subsequent to Dec. 31, 2008.  Participating Securities  In June 2008, the FASB issued new guidance, included in ASC 260 – Earnings Per Share, on determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This new guidance addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share (“EPS”) under the two-class method. This new guidance applies to the calculation of EPS for share-based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. This new guidance was effective Jan. 1, 2009. The adoption reduced basic EPS by approximately one cent for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008 and for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008. All prior period EPS data was adjusted to conform to the provisions of this new guidance.  Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations that Arise from Contingencies  On April 1, 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on disclosures and accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies, included in ASC 805 – Business Combinations. This new guidance amends previous guidance and requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the acquisition-date fair value can be   reasonably determined. If the acquisition-date fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably determined, the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized for liabilities in accordance with ASC 450 – Contingencies. The disclosure requirements apply to business combination transactions completed subsequent to Dec. 31, 2008.  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  In March 2008, the FASB issued disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, included in ASC 815 – Derivatives and Hedging. This new guidance requires entities to disclose the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format and information about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk, and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments. Entities are required to provide additional disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815 and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Note 18 reflects these disclosure requirements.  Useful Life of Intangible Assets  In April 2008, the FASB issued new guidance on the determination of the useful life of intangible assets, included in ASC 350 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. This guidance amended the factors that should be considered in renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life and initial fair value of recognized intangible assets. The new guidance became effective Jan. 1, 2009.  BNY Mellon estimates the fair value of intangible assets at acquisition generally on the basis of an income approach using discounted estimated cash flows. For customer relationship and customer contract intangibles, the expected renewals by customers are included in estimating the period over which cash flows will be generated to BNY Mellon. Estimates of customer renewals are generally based upon the historical information of the acquired intangible assets, and also consider BNY Mellon’s own historical experience with similar types of customer relationships and contracts. In the absence    68 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      of historical information or our own experience, we use assumptions market participants would expect to use consistent with the highest and best use of the assets.  Intangibles are amortized over the periods of and in a pattern that is consistent with the identifiable cash flows, or on a straight-line method over the benefit period if the pattern of cash flows is not estimable.  The initial application of this guidance did not impact BNY Mellon as it already considers expected customer renewals or extensions in cash flow estimates used to estimate fair values and useful lives. BNY Mellon does not capitalize any costs incurred that may contribute to the renewal or extension of any customer relationship and contract intangibles.  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, included in ASC 320 – Investments – Debt and Equity Securities. This new guidance replaced the “intent and ability” indication in previous guidance by specifying that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held-to-maturity debt securities, the amount of OTTI recorded in OCI for the non-credit portion of a previous OTTI should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.  ASC 320 requires entities to initially apply the provisions of the standard to previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities (i.e. debt securities that the entity does not intend to sell and that the entity is not more likely than not required to sell before recovery) existing as of the date of initial adoption by making a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the   period of adoption. The cumulative-effect adjustment reclassifies the noncredit portion of a previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt security held as of the date of initial adoption to accumulated OCI from retained earnings.  This guidance also amends the previous disclosure provisions of ASC 320 for both debt and equity securities. It requires disclosures in interim and annual periods for major security types identified on the basis of how an entity manages, monitors and measures its securities and the nature and risks of the security. We adopted this new guidance effective Jan 1, 2009. As a result of adopting this guidance, BNY Mellon recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2009 of $676 million (after-tax) to reclassify the non-credit component of the previously recognized OTTI from retained earnings to accumulated OCI (for those securities where management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that BNY Mellon will be required to sell the securities before recovery).  Nonactive Markets  In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly, included in ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The fair value of an asset, when the market is not active, is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, the inactive market). Entities need to conclude whether a transaction was orderly based on the weight of evidence. When estimating fair value, more weight is placed on transactions that BNY Mellon concludes are orderly and less weight on transactions for which we do not have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction is orderly. This new guidance also amends the disclosure provisions of ASC 820 to require entities to disclose on interim and annual periods the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 69    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments  In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, included in ASC 825 – Financial Instruments. This new guidance amends previous guidance included in ASC 825 and ASC 270 – Interim Reporting to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. These disclosures were effective June 30, 2009. Note 15 reflects these disclosures requirements.  Subsequent Events  In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on subsequent events, included in ASC 855 – Subsequent Events. This guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855 renames type one and type two subsequent events as “recognized” subsequent events and “non-recognized” subsequent events. For recognized subsequent events, an entity shall recognize in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. For unrecognized subsequent events, an entity shall not recognize subsequent events about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but that arose after the balance sheet date. Adoption of this guidance had no impact on our results of operations at Sept. 30, 2009.  FASB Accounting Standards Codification  In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-1, “The FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This ASU is included in ASC 105 – Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and established the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under authority of federal securities laws are also   sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification became the exclusive authoritative reference at Sept. 30, 2009.  Note 3 — Acquisitions and dispositions  There were no material acquisitions or dispositions completed in the third quarter of 2009.  In July 2009, we reached an agreement to sell MUNB, our national bank subsidiary located in Florida, to Banco Sabadell of Spain. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010.  We frequently structure our acquisitions with both an initial payment and later contingent payments tied to post-closing revenue or income growth. For acquisitions completed prior to Jan. 1, 2009, we record the fair value of contingent payments as an additional cost of the entity acquired in the period that the payment becomes probable. For acquisitions completed after Jan. 1, 2009, subsequent changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability will be recorded through the income statement. Contingent payments totaled $1 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $25 million in the first nine months of 2009.  At Sept. 30, 2009, we were potentially obligated to pay additional consideration which, using reasonable assumptions for the performance of the acquired companies and joint ventures based on contractual agreements, could range from approximately $75 million to $145 million over the next four years. None of the potential contingent additional consideration was recorded as goodwill at Sept. 30, 2009.  Acquisitions in 2008  In January 2008, we acquired ARX Capital Management (“ARX”). ARX is a leading independent asset management business, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, specializing in Brazilian multi-strategy, long/short and long only investment strategies. The impact of this acquisition was not material to earnings per share.  On Dec. 31, 2008, we acquired the Australian (Ankura Capital) and U.K. (Blackfriars Asset Management) businesses from our Asset Management joint venture with WestLB. The impact of this acquisition was not material to earnings per share.    70 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Dispositions in 2008  In February 2008, we sold our B-Trade and G-Trade execution businesses to BNY ConvergEx Group. These businesses were sold at book value.  On March 31, 2008, we sold a portion of the Estabrook Capital Management business which reduced our AUM by $2.4 billion. We retained approximately 30% of the AUM which are primarily managed by the Wealth Management segment.  In June 2008, we sold Mellon 1st Business Bank, based in Los Angeles, California. The sale reduced loan and deposit levels by $1.1 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. There was no gain or loss recorded on this transaction.  On Oct. 1, 2008, we sold the assets of Gannett Welsh & Kotler, an investment management subsidiary with approximately $8 billion in AUM.  Note 4 — Discontinued operations  In July 2009, BNY Mellon reached an agreement to sell MUNB, our national bank subsidiary located in Florida. As a result, we applied discontinued operations accounting to this business and the income statements for all periods in this Form 10-Q have been restated. This business, which was previously reported in the Other segment, no longer fits our strategic focus on our asset management and securities servicing businesses.   Results for discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2009 were a loss of $19 million primarily related to additional provision for credit losses resulting from the further deterioration of the South Florida real estate market. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $85 million, primarily attributable to the elimination of $82 million of goodwill.

Subsequently, if the security is downgraded we do not alter this decision.  ASC 325 provides specific guidance for certain debt securities which are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. Specifically, ASC 325 provides incremental impairment guidance for a subset of the debt securities within the scope of ASC 320. For securities where there is no debt rating at acquisition, and the security is a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets, BNY Mellon uses the ASC 325 impairment model. For securities where there is no debt rating at acquisition and the security is not a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets BNY Mellon uses the impairment model guidance under ASC 320.  We routinely conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment security to determine whether OTTI has occurred. Economic models are used to determine whether an OTTI has occurred on these securities. While all securities are considered, the securities primarily impacted by OTTI testing are non-agency RMBS and HELOCs. For each non-agency RMBS in the investment portfolio (including but not limited to those whose fair value is less than their amortized cost basis), an extensive, regular review is conducted to determine if an OTTI has occurred. Various inputs to the economic models are used to determine if an unrealized loss on non-agency RMBS is other-than-temporary. The most significant inputs are:      •    Default rate – the number of mortgage loans expected to go into default over the life of the transaction, which is driven by the roll rate of loans in each performance bucket that will ultimately migrate to default; and    •    Severity – the loss expected to be realized when a loan defaults  To determine if the unrealized loss for non-agency RMBS is other-than-temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value upon sale in the marketplace (severity) in order to determine the projected   collateral loss. We also evaluate the current credit enhancement underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash flows. If we determine that a given RMBS position will be subject to a write-down or loss, we record the expected credit loss as a charge to earnings.  In addition, we have estimated the expected loss by taking into account observed performance of the underlying securities, industry studies, market forecasts, as well as our view of the economic outlook affecting bond collateral.  The table below shows the projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities for the recent-vintage (i.e. 2007, 2006 and late 2005) non-agency RMBS portfolios at Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.

The HELOC securities credit enhancement is provided by a combination of excess spread, over-collateralization, subordination, and a note insurance policy provided by a monoline insurer. For the HELOC holdings, the rating is highly dependent upon the rating of the monoline insurance provider.  If a monoline insurer experiences a credit rating downgrade and it is determined that the monoline insurer may not be able to meet its obligations, the HELOC holdings guaranteed by that insurer are further evaluated based on the deal collateral and structure without the insurer guarantee. Potential losses are compared to the available total coverage provided by excess spread, over-collateralization and subordination for each bond to determine OTTI.  The following table provides the detail of securities portfolio losses. Securities losses in 2008 reflect mark-to-market (both credit and non-credit) impairment securities losses.

The beginning balance represents the credit loss component for which OTTI occurred on debt securities in prior periods. The additions represent the first time a debt security was credit impaired or when subsequent credit impairments have occurred.  In conjunction with the restructuring of the investment securities portfolio, in the third quarter of 2009, we changed our intent to hold to maturity on $1.7 billion of securities included in the held-to-maturity classification and recorded mark-to-market losses, both credit and non-credit, on these securities in the income statement. These securities have experienced a decrease in the credit quality of the issuer or a significant increase in the risk-weight used for regulatory capital purposes.

Intangible assets    Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate they may be impaired. The decrease in intangible assets at Sept. 30, 2009 compared with Dec. 31, 2008 resulted from intangible amortization partially offset by foreign exchange translation on non-U.S. dollar denominated intangible assets.   Intangible amortization expense was $104 million in the third quarter of 2009, $108 million in the second quarter of 2009, $118 million in the third quarter of 2008, $319 million in the first nine months of 2009 and $360 million in the first nine months of 2008.    76 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       The table below provides a breakdown of intangible assets by business segment.

In the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, we recorded a recovery of $5 million and   additional charges of $11 million, respectively associated with this workforce reduction.  As of Sept. 30, 2009, we have eliminated approximately 1,400 positions. Severance payments related to these positions are primarily paid over the salary continuance period in accordance with the separation plan. We expect to substantially complete this reduction by the end of 2009.    The following table presents the activity in the restructuring reserve through Sept. 30, 2009.

If these tax reserves were unnecessary, $222 million would affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the balance sheet as of Sept. 30, 2009 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $87 million. The additional tax expense related to interest for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009 was $3 million and $42 million, respectively.  Our federal consolidated income tax returns are closed to examination through 2002. Our New York State and New York City return examinations have been completed through 1996. In   October 2009, BNY Mellon reached an agreement with New York State and New York City representatives to close its audits for 1997 through 2004. We do not expect this settlement to have a significant impact on our financial results. Our United Kingdom income tax returns are closed through 2002.  Note 14 — Securitizations and variable interest entities  Securitizations  In 2000, we purchased Dreyfus Institutional Reserves Money Fund shares and sold the right to receive the principal value of the shares in 2021 in a securitization transaction and retained the rights to receive the ongoing dividends from the shares.  In 2003, BNY Mellon securitized quarterly variable rate municipal bonds, which are Aa3/AAA insured bonds issued by borrowers rated no lower than A2/A+ by Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poors. No gain or loss was recognized on this transaction.  Our retained interests in these securitizations at Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008, are approximately $137 million and $234 million, respectively, which represents our maximum exposure to the securitizations. BNY Mellon did not securitize any assets during the first nine months of 2009.  At Sept. 30, 2009, BNY Mellon had no asset-backed commercial paper conduits.  Variable Interest Entities  Guidance on “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, included in ASC 810 applies to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The primary beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns or both, as a result of holding variable interests. BNY Mellon is required to    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 81    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      consolidate entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.  BNY Mellon’s VIEs generally include retail, institutional and alternative investment funds offered to its retail and institutional customers. BNY Mellon may provide start-up capital in its new funds and also earns fund management fees. Performance fees are also earned on certain funds. BNY Mellon is not contractually required to provide financial or any other support to its VIEs. In addition, we provide trust and custody services for a fee to entities sponsored by other corporations in which we have no other interest.  Primary beneficiary calculations are prepared in accordance with ASC 810. This evaluation includes estimates of ranges and probabilities of losses and returns from the funds. The calculated expected gains and expected losses are allocated to the variable interests holders of the funds, which are generally the fund’s investors and may include BNY Mellon, in order to determine which entity is required to consolidate the VIE, if any.  The start up capital invested in our Asset Management VIEs as of Sept. 30, 2009 has been included in our financial statements as shown below:                  Other VIEs at Sept. 30, 2009   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Trading   $ 30   $ -   $ 30   Available-for-sale     124     -     124   Other     254     -     254   Total   $ 408   $  -   $ 408                  Other VIEs at Dec. 31, 2008   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Trading   $ 26   $ -   $ 26   Available-for-sale     102     -     102   Other     272     -     272   Total   $ 400   $  -   $ 400  BNY Mellon has voluntarily provided limited credit support to certain money market, collective, commingled and separate account funds (the “Funds”). Entering into such support agreements represents an event under ASC 810, and is subject to its interpretations.  In analyzing the Funds for which credit support was provided, it was determined that interest rate risk and credit risk are the two   main risks that the funds are designed to create and pass through to their investors. Accordingly, interest rate and credit risk were analyzed to determine if BNY Mellon was the primary beneficiary of each of the Funds.  Credit risk variability quantification includes any potential future credit risk in a Fund and is evaluated using credit ratings and default rates. The full marks on any sensitive securities on watch are also included.  Interest rate variability quantification includes the expected Fund yield. Standard deviations are used along with the Fund’s market value to quantify the interest rate risk expected in the Fund.  BNY Mellon’s analysis of the credit risk variability and interest rate risk variability associated with the supported Funds resulted in BNY Mellon not being the primary beneficiary and therefore the Funds were not consolidated.  The table below shows the financial statement items related to non-consolidated VIEs to which we have provided credit support agreements:                  Credit supported VIEs at Sept. 30, 2009   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Other   $  -   $ 16   $ 42                  Credit supported VIEs at Dec. 31, 2008   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities    Maximum loss exposure   Other   $  -   $ 248   $ 142  Certain funds have been created solely with securities that are subject to credit support agreements where we have agreed to absorb the majority of loss. Accordingly, these funds have been consolidated into BNY Mellon and have affected the following financial statement items:                  Consolidated VIEs at Sept. 30, 2009   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Available-for-sale   $ 41   $ -   $ 41   Other     -     135     25   Total   $ 41   $ 135   $ 66    82 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)                     Consolidated VIEs at Dec. 31, 2008   (in millions)   Assets   Liabilities   Maximumloss exposure   Available-for-sale   $ 26   $ -   $ 26   Other     24     353     47   Total   $ 50   $ 353   $ 73  The maximum loss exposure shown above for the credit support agreements provided to BNY Mellon’s VIEs primarily reflects a complete loss on the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities for BNY Mellon’s clients that accepted our offer of support. As of Sept. 30, 2009, BNY Mellon recorded $110 million in liabilities related to its VIEs for which credit support agreements were provided.  Note 15 — Fair value of financial instruments  The carrying amounts of our financial instruments (i.e., monetary assets and liabilities) are determined under different accounting methods—see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in BNY Mellon’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following disclosure discusses these instruments on a uniform fair value basis. However, active markets do not exist for a significant portion of these instruments, principally loans and commitments. As a result, fair value determinations require significant subjective judgments regarding future cash flows. Other judgments would result in different fair values. Among the assumptions we used are discount rates ranging principally from 0.11% to 6.23% at Sept. 30, 2009 and 0.08% to 3.25% at Dec. 31, 2008. The fair value information supplements the basic financial statements and other traditional financial data presented throughout this report.  Note 16, “Fair value measurement” presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value by the three level valuation hierarchy established under ASC 820, as well as a roll forward schedule of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs. Note 17, “Fair value option” presents the instruments for which fair value accounting was elected and the corresponding income statement impact of these instruments.    A summary of the practices used for determining fair value is as follows.  Interest-bearing deposits with banks  The fair value of interest-bearing deposits with banks is based on discounted cash flows.  Securities, trading activities, and derivatives used for ALM  The fair value of securities and trading assets and liabilities is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes, or pricing models. Fair value amounts for derivative instruments, such as options, futures and forward rate contracts, commitments to purchase and sell foreign exchange, and foreign currency swaps, are similarly determined. The fair value of over-the-counter interest rate swaps is the discounted value of projected future cash flows, adjusted for other factors including, but not limited to and if applicable, optionality and implied volatilities, as well as counterparty credit.  Loans and commitments  For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, adjusting where appropriate for prepayment estimates, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and maturities to borrowers. Discounted future cash flows are used to determine the fair value of other types of loans. The fair value of commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit is based upon the cost to settle the commitment.  Other financial assets  Fair value is assumed to equal carrying value for these assets due to their short maturity.  Deposits, borrowings and long-term debt  The fair value of noninterest-bearing deposits and payables to customers and broker-dealers is assumed to be their carrying amount. The fair value of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and long-term debt is based upon current rates for instruments of the same remaining maturity or quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. It establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and expands the disclosures about instruments measured at fair value. ASC 820 requires consideration of a company’s own creditworthiness when valuing liabilities.  Effective Jan. 1, 2009, we adopted guidance related to “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly”, included in ASC 820. This provides guidance on how to determine the fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price notion. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with ASC 820. It also requires additional disclosures for instruments within the scope of ASC 820 to include inputs and valuation techniques used, change in valuation techniques and related inputs, if any, and more disaggregated information relating to debt and equity securities.  The amended standard provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The objective is to determine from weighted indicators    84 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      of fair value a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.  We also adopted guidance related to the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” included in ASC 825, effective Jan. 1, 2008. ASC 825 provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement basis for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments and written loan commitments which are not subject to fair value under other accounting standards.  Determination of fair value  Following is a description of our valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. We have established processes for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. For financial instruments where quotes from recent exchange transactions are not available, we determine fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis, comparison to similar instruments, and the use of financial models. Discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates. Model-based pricing uses inputs of observable prices for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, option volatilities and other factors. Models are benchmarked and validated by an independent internal risk management function. Our valuation process takes into consideration factors such as counterparty credit quality, liquidity, concentration concerns, observability of model parameters and the results of stress tests. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value.  Most derivative contracts are valued using internally developed models which are calibrated to observable market data and employ standard market pricing theory for their valuations. An initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each position assuming time-discounting based on an AA credit curve. Then, to arrive at a fair value that incorporates counterparty credit risk, a credit adjustment is made to these results by discounting each trade’s expected exposures to the counterparty using the counterparty’s credit spreads, as implied by the credit default swap market. We also adjust expected liabilities to the counterparty using BNY Mellon’s own credit spreads, also implied by the credit default swap market. Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative position is sensitive to the current   changes in our own credit spreads as well as those of our counterparties.  In certain cases, we may face additional costs to exit large risk positions or recent prices may not be observable for instruments that trade in inactive or less active markets. The costs to exit large risk positions are based on evaluating the negative change in the market during the time it would take for us to bring those positions to normal market levels for those instruments. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we make an adjustment to their value. The determination of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of external quotes, the time since the latest available quote and the price volatility of the instrument.  Certain parameters in some financial models are not directly observable and, therefore, are based on managements’ estimates and judgments. These financial instruments are normally traded less actively. Examples include certain credit products where parameters such as correlation and recovery rates are unobservable. We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate the possibility of error and revision in the model based estimate value.  The methods described above may produce a current fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our methods of determining fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. However, the use of different methodologies or different assumptions to value certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.  Valuation hierarchy  ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are described below.  Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative financial instruments actively traded on    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 85    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      exchanges and U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government securities that are actively traded in highly liquid over the counter markets.  Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, for example, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable or can be corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments that are traded less frequently than exchange traded securities and derivative instruments whose model inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market observable data. Examples in this category are certain variable and fixed rate agency and non-agency securities, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts.  Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Examples in this category include interests in certain securitized financial assets, non-agency RMBS, certain private equity investments, and derivative contracts that are highly structured or long-dated.  A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments  Where quoted market prices are not available, we generally base the fair value of loans and unfunded lending-related commitments on observable market prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit derivatives and loans with similar characteristics. If observable market prices are not available, we base the fair value on estimated cash flows adjusted for credit risk which are discounted using an interest rate appropriate for the maturity of the applicable loans or the unfunded commitments.  Unrealized gains and losses on unfunded lending   commitments carried at fair value are classified in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively. Loans and unfunded lending commitments carried at fair value are generally classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Securities  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, we classify the securities within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Securities are defined as both long and short positions. Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds, certain mortgage products and exchange-traded equities.  If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair values using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include certain agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and European floating rate notes.  For securities where quotes from recent transactions are not available for identical securities, we determine fair value primarily based on pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency that employ financial models or obtain comparison to similar instruments to arrive at “consensus” prices.  Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., vintage, position in the securitization structure) and ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of prepayment for the types of transaction and apply such variables to similar types of bonds. We view these as observable transactions in the current market place and classify such securities as Level 2. They discontinue pricing any specific security whenever they determine there is insufficient observable data to provide a good faith opinion on price.  Securities included in this category that have been affected by lack of market liquidity include our Alt-A RMBS, prime RMBS, subprime RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities.  In addition, we have significant investments in more actively traded agency RMBS and the pricing sources derive the prices for these securities largely from quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer    86 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily observed trade price and other information feeds from the interdealer brokers.  For securities with bond insurance, the financial strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that information is included in the fair value assessment for such securities.  In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, we classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Securities classified within Level 3 include certain asset-backed securities CDOs, non-agency RMBS and other retained interests in securitizations.  In the third quarter of 2009, market prices converged with our internally modeled prices. As a result, at Sept. 30, 2009, approximately 99% of our securities were valued by pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Approximately 1% of our securities were priced based on economic models and non-binding dealer quotes, and are included in Level 3 of the ASC 820 hierarchy.  Other short-term U.S. government-backed commercial paper and borrowings from Federal Reserve related to asset-backed commercial paper  These instruments are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair value of these instruments is estimated using pricing models.  Derivatives  We classify exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples include exchanged-traded equity and foreign exchange options. Since few other classes of derivative contracts are listed on an   exchange, most of our derivative positions are valued using internally developed models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters and we classify them in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic interest rate swaps and options and credit default swaps. Derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable market parameters and that are traded less actively or in markets that lack two way flow, are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples include long-dated interest rate or currency swaps, where swap rates may be unobservable for longer maturities; and certain credit products, where correlation and recovery rates are unobservable. Certain interest rate swaps with counterparties that are highly structured entities require significant judgment and analysis to adjust the value determined by standard pricing models. These interest rate swaps compose less than 1% of our derivative financial instruments. Additional disclosures of derivative instruments are provided in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Seed capital  In our Asset Management segment we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, money market and alternative investment funds for institutions and other investors; as part of that activity we make seed capital investments in certain funds. Seed capital is included in trading assets, securities available-for-sale and other assets, depending on the nature of the investment. When applicable, we value seed capital based on the published net asset value (“NAV”) of the fund. We include funds in which ownership interests in the fund are publicly-traded in an active market and institutional funds in which investors trade in and out daily in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. We include open-end funds where investors are allowed to sell their ownership interest back to the fund less frequently than daily and where our interest in the fund contains no other rights or obligations in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. However, we generally include investments in funds which allow investors to sell their ownership interest back to the fund less frequently than monthly in Level 3, unless actual redemption prices are observable.  For other types of investments in funds, we consider all of the rights and obligations inherent in our ownership interest, including the reported NAV as well as other factors that affect the fair value of our interest in the fund. To the extent the NAV    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 87    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      measurements reported for the investments are based on unobservable inputs or include other rights and obligations (e.g., obligation to meet cash calls), we generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Certain interests in securitizations  For certain interests in securitizations which are classified in securities available-for-sale and other assets, we use discounted cash flow models which generally include assumptions of projected finance charges related to the securitized assets, estimated net credit losses, prepayment assumptions and estimates of payments to third-party investors. When available, we compare our fair value estimates and assumptions to market activity and to the actual results of the securitized portfolio. Changes in these assumptions may significantly impact our estimate of fair value of the interests in securitizations; accordingly, we generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Private equity investments  Our Other segment includes holdings of nonpublic private equity investment through funds managed by third party investment managers and, to a lesser extent, direct investment in private equities. Nonpublic private equity investments generally lack quoted market prices, are less liquid and may be long term; accordingly, we must apply significant judgment in determining their fair value. We value private equity   investments initially based upon the transaction price which we subsequently adjust to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or through ongoing reviews by the investment managers.  The investment managers consider a number of factors in changes in valuation including current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, industry valuations of comparable public companies, changes in market outlook and the financing environment. Nonpublic private equity investments are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Private equity investments also include publicly held equity investments, generally obtained through the initial public offering of privately held equity investments. Publicly held investments are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less adjustments for regulatory or contractual sales restrictions.  Discounts for restrictions are quantified by analyzing the length of the restriction period and the volatility of the equity security. Publicly held investments are primarily classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Changes in Level 3 fair value measurements  The tables below include a roll forward of the balance sheet amounts for the three and nine month periods ended Sept. 30, 2009 and 2008 (including the change in fair value), for financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Our classification of a financial instrument in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is based on the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, these instruments generally include other observable components that are actively quoted or validated to third party sources; accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due to observable parameters as   well as the unobservable parameters in our valuation methodologies. We also frequently manage the risks of Level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivatives positions that are Level 1 or 2 instruments which are not included in the table; accordingly, the gains or losses below do not reflect the effect of our risk management activities related to the Level 3 instruments.  In accordance with ASC 820, BNY Mellon adjusts the discount rate on securities to reflect what they would sell for in an orderly market (model price) and compares the model prices to prices provided by pricing sources.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  Under certain circumstances we make adjustments to fair value for our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. An example would be the recording of an impairment of an asset. The following table presents the financial   instruments carried on the consolidated balance sheet by caption and by level in the fair value hierarchy at Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the quarters ended Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.    92 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)                       Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at Sept. 30, 2009 (in millions)   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Totalcarrying value   Loans (a)    $   -   $ 180   $  90   $ 270   Held-to-maturity securities (b):                   Alt-A RMBS     -     1,355     -     1,355   Subprime RMBS     -     20     -     20   Other debt securities     -     355     -     355   Total held-to-maturity securities     -     1,730     -     1,730   Other assets (c)     -     5     -     5   Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   $ -   $ 1,915   $ 90   $ 2,005                     Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at Dec. 31, 2008 (in millions)   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Totalcarrying value   Loans (a)   $ 14   $  43   $ 161   $  218   Other assets (c)     -     6     -     6   Total assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   $ 14   $ 49   $ 161   $ 224      (a)  During the quarters ended Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008, the fair value of these loans was reduced $59 million and $35 million, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral as allowed by ASC 310, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a loan, with an offset to the allowance for credit losses.    (b)  During the third quarter of 2009, we changed our intent to hold to maturity these securities, and as a result, recorded a mark-to-market adjustment of $786 million in the third quarter of 2009.    (c)  Other assets received in satisfaction of debt. The fair value of these assets was reduced $15 million in the third quarter of 2009 and was reduced $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral with an offset in other revenue.    Note 17 — Fair value option  ASC 825 provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value. Unfunded loan commitments are valued using quotes from dealers in the loan markets, and are included in Level 3 of the ASC 820 hierarchy.  At Dec. 31, 2008, $5.6 billion of other short-term U.S. government-backed commercial paper and $5.6 billion of borrowings from Federal Reserve related to asset-backed commercial paper were held at fair value. There were no balances outstanding for these instruments at Sept. 30, 2009.  Changes in fair value under the fair value option election  The following table presents the changes in fair value included in foreign exchange and other trading activities in the consolidated income statement for the three and nine month periods ended Sept. 30, 2009 and 2008.                    Foreign exchange and other trading activities      Quarter ended   Nine months ended  (in millions)   Sept. 30,2009   Sept. 30,2008   Sept. 30,2009   Sept. 30,2008   Loans   $ 1   $ -   $ 3   $ 66   Other liabilities     -     2     -     1  At Sept. 30, 2009, the fair market value of unfunded lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a liability of less than $1   million at Sept. 30, 2009 and $3 million at Dec. 31, 2008 and is included in other liabilities. The contractual amount of such commitments was $110 million at both Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008.  Note 18 — Derivative instruments  We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk, to generate profits from proprietary trading and to assist customers with their risk management objectives.  The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments express the dollar volume of the transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and enter into netting agreements to minimize the credit risk of foreign currency and interest rate risk management products. We enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.  Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative contract. We recorded $2 million of counterparty default losses in the third quarter of 2009.  Hedging derivatives  We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For hedges of fixed-rate loans, asset-backed securities, deposits and long-term debt, the hedge documentation specifies the terms of the hedged items and the    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 93    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      interest rate swaps and indicates that the derivative is hedging a fixed-rate item and is a fair value hedge, that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark interest rates, and that the strategy is to eliminate fair value variability by converting fixed-rate interest payments to LIBOR.  The fixed rate loans hedged generally have an original maturity of 10 to 11 years and are not callable. These loans are hedged with “pay fixed rate, receive variable rate” swaps with similar notional amounts, maturities, and fixed rate coupons. The swaps are not callable. At Sept. 30, 2009, $1 million of loans were hedged with interest rate swaps, which had notional values of $1 million.  The securities hedged generally have a weighted average life of 10 years or less and are callable six months prior to maturity. These securities are hedged with “pay fixed rate, receive variable rate” swaps of like maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon. The swaps are callable six months prior to maturity. At Sept. 30, 2009, $213 million of securities were hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $213 million.  The fixed rate deposits hedged generally have original maturities of 5 to 11 years and are not callable. These deposits are hedged with receive fixed rate, pay variable rate swaps of similar maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon. The swaps are not callable. At Sept. 30, 2009, $30 million of deposits were hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $30 million.  The fixed rate long-term debt hedged generally has an original maturity of 5 to 30 years. We issue both callable and non-callable debt. The non-callable debt is hedged with simple interest rate swaps similar to those described for deposits. Callable debt is hedged with callable swaps where the call dates of the swaps exactly match the call dates of the debt. At Sept. 30, 2009, $11.7 billion of debt was hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $11.3 billion.  In addition, we enter into foreign exchange hedges. We use forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge our Sterling,   Euro and Indian Rupee foreign exchange exposure with respect to forecasted revenue transactions in non-U.S. entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of Sept. 30, 2009, the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions and linked FX forward hedges were $93 million, with $3.8 million (pre-tax) of losses recorded in other comprehensive income. These gains are expected to be reclassified to income over the next nine months.  We also use forward foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of 10 months or less to hedge our Euro and Japanese Yen foreign exchange exposure with respect to forecasted foreign currency net revenue where we cannot elect hedge accounting. At Sept. 30, 2009, these economic hedges had a U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of $14 million, with $1.9 million (pre-tax) of losses from those FX forward hedges recorded in foreign exchange and other trading activities.  Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts usually have maturities of less than two years. The derivatives employed are designated as net investments hedges of changes in value of our foreign investments due to exchange rates, such that changes in value of the forward exchange contracts offset the changes in value of the foreign investments due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The change in fair market value of these contracts is deferred and reported within accumulated translation adjustments in shareholders’ equity, net of tax effects. At Sept. 30, 2009, foreign exchange contracts, with notional amounts totaling $3.7 billion, were designated as hedges.  In addition to forward foreign exchange contracts, we also designate non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Those non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries were all long-term liabilities of BNY Mellon in various currencies, and, at Sept. 30, 2009, had a combined U.S. dollar equivalent value of $888 million.    94 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Ineffectiveness related to derivatives and hedging relationships was recorded in income as follows:                Ineffectiveness   Nine months ended              (in millions)   Sept. 30,2009     Sept. 30,2008     Fair value hedge of loans   $ (0.1 )    $ 0.2     Fair value hedge of securities     0.1       (0.1 )    Fair value hedge of deposits and long-term debt     15.0       12.6     Cash flow hedges     0.0       (0.1 )    Other (a)     0.1       0.1     Total   $ 15.1     $ 12.7        (a)  Includes ineffectiveness recorded on foreign exchange hedges.

The risk from these market-making activities and from our own positions is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure as described below.  We manage trading risk through a system of position limits, a value-at-risk (“VAR”) methodology based on Monte Carlo simulations, stop loss advisory triggers, and other market sensitivity measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a separate unit on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VAR methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading   positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding period for most instruments, utilizes a 99% confidence level, and incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options. The VAR model is the basis for the economic capital calculation, which is allocated to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted performance.  As the VAR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences, the risk assessment process includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio and management’s assessment of market conditions. Additional stress scenarios based upon historic market events are also performed. Stress tests, by their design, incorporate the impact of reduced liquidity and the breakdown of observed correlations. The results of these stress tests are reviewed weekly with senior management.  Revenue from foreign exchange and other trading activities included the following:      Foreign exchange and other trading activities                             Quarter ended   Nine months ended    (in millions)   Sept. 30,2009     June 30,2009     Sept. 30,2008   Sept. 30,2009     Sept. 30,2008     Foreign exchange   $ 190     $ 240     $ 292   $ 649     $ 778     Fixed income     76       37       61     188       120     Credit derivatives     (27 )      (45 )      12     (73 )      (7 )    Other     7       5       20     26       61     Total   $ 246     $ 237     $ 385   $ 790     $ 952      Foreign exchange includes income from purchasing and selling foreign currencies and currency forwards, futures, and options. Fixed income reflects results from futures and forward contracts, interest rate swaps, futures and forward contracts, options, foreign currency swaps and fixed income securities. Credit derivatives include revenue from credit default swaps. Other primarily includes income from equity securities and equity derivatives.    Counterparty credit risk and collateral  We assess credit risk of our counterparties through regular periodic examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information. This and other information is used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to assess credit quality.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 97    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)        Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality of each counterparty. Collateral is generally held in the form of cash or highly liquid government securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.  Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Disclosure of Contingent Features in Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Derivative Instruments  Certain of the Company’s OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements contain provisions that would require the Company to take certain actions if its public debt rating fell to a certain level. A “close-out” agreement could trigger an immediate closeout and payment of outstanding contracts that are in net liability positions. Certain collateral agreements would require the Company to immediately post additional collateral to cover some or all of the Company’s liabilities to a counterparty.  The following table shows the fair value of contracts falling under close-out agreements that were in net liability positions as of Sept. 30, 2009 for three key ratings triggers.           If the Company’s rating was changed to   Potential close-outexposures (fair value)   A3/A-   $ 417 million   Baa2/BBB   $ 635 million   Bal/BB+   $ 1,445 million  Additionally, if the Company’s debt rating had fallen below investment grade on Sept. 30, 2009, existing collateral arrangements would have required the Company to have posted an additional $ 697 million of collateral.  Note 19 — Commitments and contingent liabilities  In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management products, commercial lending commitments, letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications. We assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide   customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity needs, to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks, and to trade for our own account. These items involve, to varying degrees, credit, foreign exchange, and interest rate risk not recognized in the balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar to those used for on-balance sheet risks. Significant industry concentrations related to credit exposure at Sept. 30, 2009 are disclosed in the Financial institutions portfolio exposure table and the Commercial portfolio exposure table below.

Securities lending transactions are discussed below.  A summary of our off-balance sheet credit transactions, net of participations, at Sept. 30, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2008 follows:               Off-balance sheet credit risks (in millions)   Sept. 30,2009   Dec. 31,2008   Lending commitments (a)   $ 33,310   $ 38,822   Standby letters of credit (b)     12,117     13,084   Commercial letters of credit     877     705   Securities lending indemnifications     298,785     325,975   Support agreements     138     244      (a)  Net of participations totaling $441 million at Sept. 30, 2009 and $986 million at Dec. 31, 2008.    (b)  Net of participations totaling $2.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and $2.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2008.    98 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       Included in lending commitments are facilities which provide liquidity, primarily for variable rate tax exempt securities wrapped by monoline insurers. The credit approval for these facilities is based on an assessment of the underlying tax-exempt issuer and considers factors other than the financial strength of the monoline insurer.  The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any collateral.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The allowance for lending related commitments was $140 million at Sept. 30, 2009 and $114 million at Dec. 31, 2008. A summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows: $11 billion less than one year; $22 billion in one to five years, and less than $1 billion over five years.  Standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) principally support corporate obligations. As shown in the off-balance sheet credit risks table, the maximum potential exposure of SBLCs at Sept. 30, 2009 was $12.1 billion and at Dec. 31, 2008 was $13.1 billion and includes $1.1 billion that were collateralized with cash and securities on Sept. 30, 2009 and $1.1 billion on Dec. 31, 2008. At Sept. 30, 2009, approximately $7.4 billion of the SBLCs will expire within one year and the remaining $4.7 billion will expire within one to five years.  The estimated liability for losses related to these commitments and SBLCs, if any, is included in the allowance for lending related commitments.  Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings criteria. BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below investment grade are monitored closely for payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs by investment grade:              Standby letters of credit   Sept. 30,2009     Dec. 31,2008     Investment grade   85 %    89 %    Noninvestment grade   15     11 %     A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon), to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a prearranged contract, which generally matures in less than 90 days. We generally lend securities with indemnification against broker default. We generally require the borrower to provide 102% cash collateral which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Security lending transactions are generally entered into only with highly-rated counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of $318 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and $335 billion at Dec. 31, 2008.  Our potential exposure to support agreements was approximately $138 million at Sept. 30, 2009 compared with $244 million at Dec. 31, 2008. Potential support agreement exposure is determined based on the securities subject to these agreements being valued at zero and the NAV of the related funds declining below established thresholds. This exposure includes agreements covering Lehman securities, as well as other client support agreements.  Other  We have provided standard representations for underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other similar types of arrangements and customary indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to providing financial services. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of these risks. We are a minority equity investor in, and member of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges through which foreign exchange, securities, or other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing or settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities or to provide financial support in the event other partners do not honor their obligations. It is not possible to estimate a maximum potential amount of payments that could be required with such agreements.  Legal Proceedings   In the ordinary course of business, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions,    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 99    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, and regulatory matters. Claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties and/or other remedial sanctions are possible. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, we cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be; however, on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters, either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period. BNY Mellon intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 8-K dated Oct. 23, 2009, the Federal Customs Service of the Russian Federation (the “Customs Service”) and The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Bank”), a subsidiary of BNY Mellon, have settled the litigation filed by the Customs Service seeking $22.5 billion. Pursuant to a Settlement and Release Agreement filed therewith, the Customs Service withdrew its claim, the proceedings were terminated by the Russian Arbitrazh Court, and the Customs Service and the Bank exchanged mutual releases. Without any admission of liability, the Bank agreed to pay $14 million in trial costs and expenses, which were previously accrued, to the Customs Service in consideration for the settlement.  As previously disclosed, the Bank filed a proof of claim on Jan. 18, 2008, in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Sentinel Management Group, Inc. (“Sentinel”), seeking to recover approximately $312 million loaned to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an account maintained by Sentinel at the   Bank. Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on Dec. 8, 2008, $370 million of cash has been set aside as a reserve, to be used by the Bank if its proof of claim is allowed in the bankruptcy. On March 3, 2008, the bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary complaint against BNY Mellon seeking to disallow the Bank’s claim and seeking damages against the Bank for allegedly aiding and abetting Sentinel insiders in misappropriating customer assets and improperly using them as collateral for the loan. As previously disclosed, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) has been investigating the Bank in connection with its relationship to Sentinel.  As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Bank is required to file various information and withholding tax returns with the IRS for its corporate trust business and other business lines. In 2007, we discovered certain inconsistencies in supporting documentation and records for The Bank of New York corporate trust business and other business lines. We initiated an extensive company-wide review to identify any inconsistencies in the supporting tax documentation. Any deficiencies that are identified will be promptly remediated. We made an initial disclosure of this matter to the IRS on a voluntary basis in the fourth quarter of 2007 and we continue to work diligently with the IRS to help resolve the matter. BNY Mellon recorded a $13 million reserve as of Sept. 30, 2009 which represents its estimate of the potential tax reporting inconsistencies based on the remediation status and discussions with the IRS to date.  As previously disclosed, during 2001 and 2002, we entered into various structured transactions that involved, among other things, the payment of U.K. corporate income taxes that were credited against our U.S. corporate income tax liability.  On Sept. 30, 2008, as part of our closing agreement for the 1998-2002 federal audit cycle, the IRS    100 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)      designated one such transaction for litigation and we agreed to litigate in the U.S. Tax Court.  The transaction involved payments of U.K. corporate income taxes that generated foreign tax credits over the 2001-2006 periods. The IRS has indicated it intends to seek to disallow interest deductions and the foreign tax credits primarily on the basis the transaction lacked economic substance.  The total amount of disputed tax assessments for the life of the transaction, covering the period from 2001 – 2006, is approximately $900 million including interest. Included in that amount is any exposure resulting from a Statutory Notice of Deficiency, which we received from the IRS on Aug. 17, 2009, for the 2001 and 2002 tax years, and any exposure relating to the 2003 – 2006 tax years, for which tax audits are not yet final. On April 30, 2009, we made a deposit with the IRS to mitigate interest costs that may arise from this disputed tax assessment. BNY Mellon intends to file a petition in the United States Tax Court to dispute the IRS’s claim. We are prepared to vigorously defend our position.  BNY Mellon believes the tax benefits associated with the transaction were consistent with IRS published guidance existing at the time the transaction was entered into and with various federal appellate court decisions. In the event BNY Mellon is unsuccessful in defending its position, the IRS has agreed not to assess underpayment penalties on this transaction.  Based on a probability assessment of various potential outcomes, we currently believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the tax liabilities are made when appropriate.  As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon self-disclosed to the SEC that Mellon Financial Markets LLC (“MFM”) placed orders on behalf of issuers to purchase their own Auction Rate Securities. The SEC and certain state authorities, including the Texas State Securities Board, Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the New York Attorney General are investigating these transactions. MFM is cooperating fully with the investigations.    As previously disclosed, BNY MCM entered into a letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent with FINRA relating to the sale of Auction Rate Securities (“ARS”). Two institutional customers not included in the FINRA settlement have filed lawsuits and one such customer has filed an arbitration proceeding against BNY MCM, alleging misrepresentations and omissions in the sale of ARS to them.  As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon became aware of circumstances suggesting that employees of Mellon Securities LLC (“Mellon Securities”), which executes orders to purchase and sell securities on behalf of Mellon Investor Services LLC, failed to comply with certain best execution and regulatory requirements in connection with agency cross trades. BNY Mellon self-disclosed this matter to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and the SEC on a voluntary basis. In June 2009, the SEC obtained a formal order of investigation. Mellon Securities is cooperating fully with the investigation.  As previously disclosed, a number of participants in the securities lending program, which is associated with BNY Mellon’s asset servicing business, have filed or threatened lawsuits against BNY Mellon or its affiliates. The participants allege that they have incurred losses, including losses related to investments in Sigma Finance Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., and seek damages as to those losses. Certain of these cases seek to proceed as class actions. The participants assert contractual, statutory, and common law claims, including claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.  As previously disclosed, Bernard L. Madoff has pleaded guilty to engaging in a massive investment fraud through his company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“Madoff”). As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon has no direct exposure to the Madoff fraud. Ivy Asset Management LLC (“Ivy”), a subsidiary that primarily manages funds-of-hedge-funds, has not had any funds-of-funds investments with Madoff since 2000. Several investment managers contracted with Ivy as a sub-advisor and one pension fund contracted with Ivy as investment manager; a portion of these funds were invested with Madoff and likely suffered losses as a result of the Madoff fraud.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 101    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)       BNY Mellon and its affiliates, including Ivy, have received subpoenas and document requests in connection with a number of regulatory inquiries regarding Madoff and have been cooperating with these inquiries.  BNY Mellon or its affiliates have been named in a number of civil lawsuits relating to certain investment funds that invested money with Madoff. Ivy acted as a sub-advisor to the managers of some of those funds. Plaintiffs allege that the funds suffered losses in connection with the Madoff investments. Plaintiffs assert various causes of action against BNY Mellon or its affiliates, and other parties, including securities and common-law fraud. Certain of the cases seek to proceed as class actions and/or to assert derivative claims on behalf of the funds.  The Bank has been named as a defendant in four putative class actions filed in federal court in California in connection with its role as indenture trustee for debt issued by affiliates of Medical Capital Corporation (“Medical Capital”). The actions allege that the Bank breached its fiduciary and contractual obligations to the holders of the underlying securities, and seek unspecified damages. In a separate action, the SEC has alleged that Medical Capital, along with certain of its affiliates and principals, engaged in securities fraud. The court ordered the appointment of a permanent receiver over Medical Capital. The Bank is not a party to the SEC action.    Note 20 — Business segments  Our segment data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting principles used for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the segments will track their economic performance.  Segment results are subject to reclassification whenever improvements are made in the measurement principles or when organizational changes are made.  The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in BNY Mellon’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For additional information on our business segments, see the Business segment review in BNY Mellon’s second quarter 2009 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In the second quarter of 2009, the financial results of MUNB were moved from the Other segment into discontinued operations. Historical results in the Other segment have been restated.  The following consolidating schedules show the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability. Business segments are reported on a continuing operations basis for all periods presented.    102 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (continued)                                                  For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2009            (dollar amounts in millions)   AssetManagement     WealthManagement      Total Asset andWealthManagementSector     AssetServicing     IssuerServices     ClearingServices     TreasuryServices     TotalInstitutionalServicesSector     OtherSegment     TotalContinuingOperations     Fee and other revenue   $ 592     $ 145     $ 737     $ 835     $ 389     $ 291     $ 216     $ 1,731     $ (4,684 )    $ (2,216 )    Net interest revenue     6       49       55       228       180       81       151       640       21       716     Total revenue     598       194       792       1,063       569       372       367       2,371       (4,663 )      (1,500 )    Provision for credit losses     -

N/M—Not meaningful.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 103    Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures      Disclosure controls and procedures  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by BNY Mellon is accumulated and communicated to BNY Mellon’s management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our ethics hotline can also be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.    As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  Changes in internal control over financial reporting  In the ordinary course of business, we may routinely modify, upgrade or enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the third quarter of 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    104 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents  Forward-looking Statements      Some statements in this document are forward-looking. These include all statements about the future results of BNY Mellon; the economic outlook for the remainder of 2009; areas of our business expected to be impacted by the current market environment; the impact of changes in the value of market indices; factors affecting the performance of our segments; the effect of economic conditions on goodwill and intangible assets; management’s judgment in determining the size of unallocated allowances and the effect of credit ratings on allowances, estimates and cash flow models. In addition, these forward-looking statements relate to: our anticipated fourth quarter of 2009 tax rate; the impact of deterioration of underlying collateral of our investment securities on future impairments; our strategic focus, including the planned sale of Mellon United National Bank; the expected increase in the percentage of revenue and income from outside the U.S.; targeted capital ratios; the FDIC’s extension of certain programs created to address market events and expenses incurred with respect to these programs; expectations with respect to prepayment of FDIC risk-based assessments; deposit levels; our decision to reduce cash held at central banks and invest in certain types of securities; expectations with respect to earnings per share; expectations with respect to the restructuring of BNY Mellon’s investment securities portfolio, including statements with respect to the impact of the restructuring on future pricing, net interest revenue and risk of future securities losses, retention of the remaining restructured securities; the reflection of declines in the fair value of securities in BNY Mellon’s net income; statements with respect to the value of our securities portfolio and our intent to hold securities until maturity; assumptions with respect to residential mortgage-backed securities; statements on our institutional credit strategies; goals with respect to our commercial portfolio; trends in the real estate market; descriptions of our allowance for credit losses and loan losses; expectations with respect to declines in the provision for credit losses; assumptions in amounts of interest income for loans on nonaccrual status; descriptions of our exposure to support agreements; statements with respect to our liquidity targets, including the effect of reductions in securities servicing; access to capital markets; expectations with respect to capital, including anticipated repayment and call of outstanding debt and issuance of replacement securities; assumptions with respect to the effects of changes in risk-weighted assets on capital ratios; estimations in net interest rate sensitivities; timing and impact of adoption of recent accounting guidance; the materiality of acquisitions; the timing of our reductions in workforce; amount of dividends bank subsidiaries can pay without regulatory waiver; BNY Mellon’s anticipated actions with respect to legal or regulatory proceedings; the expected outcome and impact of judgments   and settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings.  In this report, any other report, any press release or any written or oral statement that BNY Mellon or its executives may make, words, such as “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “confident” “target,” “expect,” “intend,” “seek,” “believe,” “plan,” “goal,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “strategy,” “synergies,” “opportunities,” “trends” and words of similar meaning, signify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause BNY Mellon’s results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, as well as other uncertainties affecting future results and the value of BNY Mellon’s stock and factors which represents risk associated with the business and operations of BNY Mellon, can be found in Risk Factors in the Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and any subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) by BNY Mellon pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Forward-looking statements, including discussions and projections of future results of operations and discussions of future plans contained in the MD&A, are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions that involve risk and uncertainties and that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond BNY Mellon’s control), including adverse changes in market conditions, and the timing of such changes, and the actions that management could take in response to these changes. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties and the risks and uncertainties described in the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Risk Factors discussed in the Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2008 and in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 could cause or contribute to such differences. Investors should consider all risks mentioned elsewhere in this document and in subsequent reports filed by BNY Mellon with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, as well as other uncertainties affecting future results and the value of BNY Mellon’s stock.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and BNY Mellon undertakes no obligation to update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 105    Table of Contents       Part II — Other Information         Item 1. Legal Proceedings  In the ordinary course of business, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, and regulatory matters. Claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties and/or other remedial sanctions are possible. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, BNY Mellon cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be; however, on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters, either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period. BNY Mellon intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions.  See the “Legal proceedings” section in Note 19 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which portion is incorporated by reference in response to this item.  Item 2.
