Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 21 through 35 of our Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011. The discussion of Risk Factors, as so supplemented, sets forth our most significant risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, other factors, besides those discussed below or in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011 or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, also could adversely affect our business or results. We cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report and such other reports address all potential risks that we may face. These risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Form 10-Q. See “Forward-looking Statements.”  Continued litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings involving our foreign exchange standing instruction program and resulting adverse publicity could affect our reputation and negatively impact our foreign exchange business.  Beginning in 2009, our foreign exchange standing instruction program became the subject of litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings. See “Legal proceedings” in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings have generated substantial scrutiny of, and adverse publicity concerning, our foreign exchange standing instruction program. Continued litigation involving our foreign exchange standing instruction program, and the resulting scrutiny and adverse publicity, could affect our reputation and discourage clients from doing business with us. For example, these proceedings have resulted in the loss of Ohio public fund custody clients, which has attracted media attention and led to inquiries from other clients,   investors and employees. If we continue to be subject to these proceedings and the resulting adverse publicity relating to our foreign exchange standing instruction program, our reputation could be further affected, adversely impacting our business and results of operations. For example, pressure on pricing may cause our foreign exchange revenue to decline. See “Foreign exchange and other trading revenue” in the MD&A – Results of Operations section of our Form 10-Q for more information regarding our foreign exchange business, including business practices, results of operations and trends.  If our information systems experience a disruption or breach in security that results in a loss of confidential client information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.  We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. While our information systems have been subjected to cyber threats, including hacker attacks, viruses, denial of service efforts and unauthorized access attempts, we deploy a broad range of sophisticated defenses and we have avoided a material breach. The security of our computer systems, software and networks, and those functions that we may outsource, may continue to be subjected to cyber threats that could result in failures or disruptions in our business, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan systems. Our businesses that rely heavily on technology, such as our Investment Services business, are particularly vulnerable to security breaches and technology disruptions. Breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential information, including employees and customers, as well as hackers. A breach of security that results in the loss of confidential client information may require us to reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring efforts and would be costly and time-consuming, and may negatively impact our results of operations and reputation. Additionally, security breaches or disruptions of our information systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients, which could expose us to liability for damages, result in the loss of customer business, damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the failure to upgrade or     BNY Mellon 121    Table of Contents Part II – Other Information (continued)        maintain our computer systems, software and networks, as necessary, could also make us susceptible to breaches and unauthorized access and misuse. There can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. We may be required to   expend significant additional resources to modify, investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from information systems security risks.
