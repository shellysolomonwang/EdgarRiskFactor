Item 1A. Risk Factors           Our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in that Form 10-K.  Risk factors relating to our business and our common stock  Current difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. The stress experienced by global financial markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the third quarter of 2008. The volatility and disruption in the global financial markets have reached unprecedented levels. The availability and cost of credit has been materially affected. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, depressed home prices and increasing foreclosures, falling equity market values, declining business and consumer confidence and the risks of increased inflation and unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a severe recession.  The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business and our financial condition and results of operations. We do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:      •    We expect to face increased regulation of our industry, including as a result of the EESA. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.    •    The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure and to ascertain the fair value of securities held by us is subject to uncertainty in that it        requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers and others to meet their obligations.    •    Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the public credit markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.    •    Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.    •    We may be required to pay significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums due to the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.  Limits on common stock dividends  Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. Any reduction of, or the elimination of, our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As part of the capital issuance referred to below under “Risks relating to our industry and financial markets”, we agreed that for three years (or such prior time as the U.S. Treasury ceases to hold the securities issued by the Company) we will not pay any dividends on our common stock other than regular quarterly dividends of not more than $0.24 per share. In addition, on Oct. 28, 2008, the Company issued to the U.S. Treasury, $3 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, which pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per annum until the fifth anniversary of the date of the investment and thereafter at a rate of 9% per annum. The Series B preferred shares rank senior to the Company’s common stock, and may impact the Company’s ability to pay dividends on the common stock.    92 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Item 1A. Risk Factors   (continued)        Risk factors relating to our industry and financial markets  There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation authorizing the U.S. government to purchase large amounts of illiquid mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions will help stabilize the U.S. financial system.  On Oct. 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”). The legislation was the result of a proposal by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to the U.S. Congress on Sept. 20, 2008 in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury will have the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that the EESA will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The failure of the EESA to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.  Our ability to engage in routing funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have   led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations, or that the EESA will stabilize current market conditions.  Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.   Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered these models. Changes to the models, general economic conditions, or other circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency’s judgment of its rating and the rating it assigns us.  In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, we believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. The outcome of such a review may have adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may be required to take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us.    The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 93    Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures      Disclosure controls and procedures  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our ethics hotline can also be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.    Changes in internal control over financial reporting  In the ordinary course of business, we may routinely modify, upgrade or enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the third quarter of 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except changes resulting from the merger with Mellon Financial being implemented to incorporate Mellon Financial’s operations with The Bank of New York’s systems of internal control.    94 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents  Forward-looking Statements      Some statements in this document are forward-looking.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 95    Table of Contents  Part II — Other information      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and potential legal actions, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, and regulatory matters. Claims for significant monetary damages are asserted in certain of these actions and proceedings. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement and the imposition of penalties and/or other remedial sanctions are possible. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, the Company cannot ascertain what the eventual outcome of these matters will be; however, on the basis of current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that enforceable judgments or settlements, if any, arising from pending or potential legal actions or regulatory matters, either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company, although they could have a material effect on net income for a given period. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the claims asserted in these legal actions.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, The Federal Customs Service of the Russian Federation is pursuing a claim against The Bank of New York, now known as The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Bank”). The claim is based on allegations relating to the previously disclosed Russian funds transfer matter that was the subject of the Bank’s Non-Prosecution Agreement and alleges violations of U.S. law by the Bank in failing to supervise and monitor funds transfer activities at the Bank. This “lack of action” is alleged to have resulted in underpayment to the Russian Federation of the value added taxes that were allegedly due to be paid by customers of the Bank’s correspondent clients on certain goods imported into the country. The claim seeks $22.5 billion in “direct and indirect” losses.  The Bank has been defending itself vigorously in this matter and intends to continue to do so. The Bank believes it has meritorious procedural and substantive defenses to the allegations in the Russian courts and also believes that if a judgment were to be entered in this   matter by the Russian courts, the Bank has meritorious defenses to an attempted enforcement of a judgment outside the Russian Federation in countries in which the Bank has material assets.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, during 2001 and 2002, we entered into various structured transactions that involved, among other things, the payment of U.K. corporate income taxes that were credited against our U.S. corporate income tax liability.  As previously disclosed, we received a letter from the IRS on Oct. 9, 2007 informing us that the IRS is considering designating one such transaction for litigation. On Sept. 17, 2008, we received a further letter from the IRS notifying us that our case had been referred to the IRS Chief Counsel for his consideration and decision. On Sept. 30, 2008, as part of our closing agreement for the 1998-2002 federal audit cycle (for additional information see Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), the IRS designated the transaction for litigation and we agreed to litigate in the U.S. Tax Court.  The transaction involved payments of U.K. corporate income taxes that generated foreign tax credits over the 2001-2006 period. The IRS has indicated it intends to seek to disallow the foreign tax credits primarily on the basis the transaction lacked economic substance. We are prepared to vigorously defend our position and believe the tax benefits associated with the transaction were consistent with IRS published guidance existing at the time the transaction was entered into and with various federal appellate court decisions. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, the IRS has agreed not to assess underpayment penalties on this transaction.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Bank filed a proof of claim on Jan. 18, 2008, in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Sentinel Management Group, Inc. (“Sentinel”), seeking to recover approximately $312 million loaned to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an account maintained by Sentinel at the Bank. At the time of the bankruptcy, the cash and securities collateral for the loan were valued at over $600 million. On March 3, 2008, the Chapter 11 Trustee for Sentinel filed an adversary proceeding against the Bank seeking to disallow the Bank’s claim and asserting a claim for damages against the Bank under a variety of theories including that the Bank aided and abetted certain insiders of Sentinel    96 The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation    Table of Contents       Part II — Other information   (continued)        in mis-appropriating customer assets and improperly using those assets as collateral for the loan. In January 2008, the Bank learned that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) opened an investigation that includes a review of Sentinel’s relationship with the Bank. While the timing and outcome of the bankruptcy is uncertain, the Company intends to vigorously pursue its claim.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the SEC is investigating the trading activities of Pershing Trading Company LP, a floor specialist, on two regional exchanges from 1999 to 2004. Because the conduct at issue is alleged to have occurred largely during the period when Pershing was owned by Credit Suisse First Boston (USA), Inc. (“CSFB”), the Company has made claims for indemnification against CSFB relating to this matter under the agreement relating to the acquisition of Pershing. CSFB is disputing these claims for indemnification.  As previously disclosed in the Company’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in connection with the acquired JPMorgan Chase corporate trust business, the Bank was required to file various IRS information and withholding tax returns for 2006. In preparing to do so, the Bank identified certain inconsistencies in the supporting tax documentation and records transferred to the Bank that were needed to file accurate returns. The Company and JPMorgan Chase jointly disclosed this matter to the IRS on a voluntary basis in a meeting on Sept. 7, 2007. The Company and JPMorgan Chase remain in advanced discussions with the IRS, which if successful, will resolve the information reporting and withholding issues presented. While there can be no assurance, the Company believes that after remediation the potential financial exposure will be immaterial, and, in any event, the Bank is indemnified by JPMorgan Chase for the 2006 tax withholding and reporting obligations associated with the acquisition.  As previously disclosed, the Company self-disclosed to the SEC that Mellon Financial Markets LLC (“MFM”) placed orders on behalf of issuers to purchase their own Auction Rate Securities. The SEC and certain state authorities are investigating these transactions. MFM is cooperating fully with the investigations.    As previously disclosed, in the course of a routine review of customer accounts at Mellon Securities LLC (“Mellon Securities”), the Company became aware of circumstances suggesting that employees of Mellon Securities, which executes orders to purchase and sell securities on behalf of Mellon Investor Services LLC, failed to comply with certain best execution and regulatory requirements in connection with agency cross trades. The Company is reviewing the trades and is in the process of determining the extent of any remediation. The Company self-disclosed this matter to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the SEC on a voluntary basis.  As previously disclosed, in December 2004, the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) commenced an inquiry into BNY Capital Markets, Inc. (now BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC, “BNY MCM”) concerning the participation in certain partial tender offers for publicly traded securities by a small group of former traders, which was prompted by BNY MCM’s disclosure to the NASD that it had identified certain instances in which BNY MCM tendered in excess of the firm’s net long position in the underlying securities, in violation of SEC Rule 14e-4. In late July 2008, the staff of FINRA, the successor to the NASD, informed the Company that it has made a preliminary determination to recommend disciplinary action in connection with seven partial tender offers and BNY MCM’s supervision of these activities. FINRA invited BNY MCM to submit a “Wells” submission setting forth any defenses or arguments it may have against a disciplinary action, which BNY MCM submitted in August 2008.  In August 2008, FINRA commenced an inquiry into BNY MCM concerning the sale of Auction Rate Securities (“ARS”). On Sept. 16, 2008, BNY MCM signed a “Settlement Term Sheet” with FINRA to resolve the investigation with a censure without admitting or denying FINRA’s findings that the firm sold ARS using advertising or marketing materials that were not fair and balanced. BNY MCM agreed to buy back certain ARS from the relevant class who purchased ARS from May 31, 2006 through Feb. 28, 2008 (total par value of approximately $20 million) and to pay a $250,000 fine.
