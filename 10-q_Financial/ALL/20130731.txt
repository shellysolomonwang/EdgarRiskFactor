Item 1A. Risk Factors   This document contains “forward-looking statements” that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.   These forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “seeks,” “expects,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “believes,” “likely,” “targets” and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, catastrophe exposure management, product development, investment results, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below), in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and those incorporated by reference in Part I, Item 1A of The Allstate Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2012.   Our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock is subject to limitations under terms of certain of our securities   Subject to certain limited exceptions, during any dividend period while our preferred stock is outstanding, unless the full preferred stock dividends for the preceding dividend period have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside and any declared but unpaid preferred stock dividends for any prior period have been paid, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock.   We are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock in excess of the amount of net proceeds from an issuance of common stock taking place within 90 days before a dividend declaration date if, on that dividend declaration date, either: (1) the risk-based capital ratios of our largest U.S. property-casualty insurance subsidiaries that collectively account for 80% or more of the net written premiums of our U.S. property-casualty insurance business on a weighted average basis were less than 175% of their company action level risk-based capital as of the end of the most recent year; or (2) our consolidated net income for the four-quarter period ending on the preliminary quarter end test date (the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter) is zero or negative and our consolidated shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, and subject to certain other adjustments relating to changes in U.S. GAAP) as of each of the preliminary quarter test date and the most recently completed quarter has declined by 20% or more from its level as measured at the end of the benchmark quarter (the date that is ten quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter). If we fail to satisfy either of these tests on any dividend declaration date, the restrictions on dividends will continue until we are able again to satisfy the test on a dividend declaration date. In addition, in the case of a restriction arising under (2) above, the restrictions on dividends will continue until our consolidated shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, and subject to certain other adjustments relating to changes in U.S. GAAP) has increased, or has declined by less than 20%, in either case as compared to its level at the end of the benchmark quarter for each dividend payment date as to which dividend restrictions were imposed. Examples of situations where we may fail the above tests include: a financial crisis or other negative trends in the global economy and capital markets, or a significant catastrophe loss event.   The terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.   91        Item 2.
