Item 1A. Risk Factors   This document contains “forward-looking statements” that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.   These forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “seeks,” “expects,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “believes,” “likely,” “targets” and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, catastrophe exposure management, product development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below), in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and those incorporated by reference in Part I, Item 1A of The Allstate Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2007.   The impact of premium rate decreases for the California auto and homeowners matters on premiums written and underwriting income, may be materially greater than projected   The adverse effect on premiums written and premiums earned, a component of underwriting income, may be materially greater than projected because policyholder attrition may be lower.   The impact of our investment strategies may be adversely affected by developments in the investment markets   The impact of our investment portfolio risk mitigation and return optimization programs and enterprise asset allocation actions may be adversely affected by unexpected developments in the investment markets. For example, derivative contracts, when entered into, may result in coverage that is not as effective as intended.   Our capital position and our liquidity levels may be adversely affected by developments in the investment markets   Our capital position and our liquidity levels may be adversely affected by unexpected developments in the investment markets, such as disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, and result in realized and unrealized capital losses that may significantly reduce our financial position and may limit our access to capital required to operate our business.   Reducing our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements may adversely affect reported results   Due to the current capital market conditions, we are evaluating strategies to reduce our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements. Lower new sales of these products, as well as our ongoing risk mitigation and return optimization programs, may lead to lower levels of income which could negatively impact DAC amortization, goodwill impairment testing and insurance reserves deficiency testing.   The realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty   The realization of our deferred tax assets is based on our assumption that we will be able to fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes. However, actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained.   102        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
