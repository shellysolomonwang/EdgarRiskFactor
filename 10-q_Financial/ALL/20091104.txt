Item 1A. Risk Factors   This document contains “forward-looking statements” that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. These forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “seeks,” “expects,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “believes,” “likely,” “targets” and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, catastrophe exposure management, product development, investment results, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below), in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and those incorporated by reference in Part I, Item 1A of The Allstate Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2008.   Changes in estimates of profitability on interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment products may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition through the amortization of DAC   DAC related to interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future gross profits (“EGP”) over the estimated lives of the contracts. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of EGP are investment returns, including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities, interest crediting rates to contractholders, and the effects of persistency, mortality, expenses, and hedges if applicable. Updates to these assumptions (commonly referred to as “DAC unlocking”) could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In 2009, DAC unlocking resulted in increased amortization of DAC of $277 million. In addition in periods when actual gross profits are negative, recapitalization (“negative amortization”) of DAC is only recorded when determined to be recoverable based on specific facts and circumstances.   Examples of such situations include the world wide financial crisis, which resulted in an unprecedented level of realized capital losses. A principal assumption change impacting EGP and the related DAC amortization was an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in 2009 and 2010. This resulted in the majority of the market value adjusted annuity DAC balance being reduced to zero since the products in force were estimated to have no gross profits. Market value adjusted annuity DAC will not be recapitalized while there are no estimated gross profits. Facts and circumstances may lead to other situations where DAC is not recapitalized. Accordingly, judgments regarding the recognition of Allstate Financial’s DAC amortization may adversely affect profitability and financial condition.   A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism, or ongoing military actions may have an adverse effect on the level of claim losses we incur, the value of our investment portfolio, our competitive position, marketability of product offerings, liquidity and operating results   A large scale pandemic, the continued threat of terrorism, within the United States and abroad, or ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and losses in our investment portfolio from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by a large scale pandemic or the continued   101        threat of terrorism. We seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available. Additionally, in the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial business segments, a large scale pandemic or terrorist act could have a material adverse effect on the sales, profitability, competitiveness, marketability of product offerings, liquidity, and operating results.   Proposed regulatory reforms, and the more stringent application of existing regulations, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business   The federal government has released a set of proposed regulatory reforms with respect to financial services entities. As part of a larger effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, the proposal outlines certain reforms applicable to the insurance industry, including the establishment of an Office of National Insurance within the Treasury Department. The reforms could also increase the regulation of large insurance conglomerates whose failure could pose a systemic risk to the financial system. In addition, the federal government has issued a set of principles for reforming the U.S. and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms.   We are a diversified unitary savings and loan holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The principal supervisory authority for the diversified unitary savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”). We are subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements and its enforcement authority. Among other things, this permits the OTS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness and stability of Allstate Bank.   Any additional legislation or regulatory requirements imposed upon us in connection with the federal government proposed regulatory reforms or arising from the principles for reforming the U.S. and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms, and any more stringent enforcement of existing regulations by federal authorities, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business.   102        Item 2.
