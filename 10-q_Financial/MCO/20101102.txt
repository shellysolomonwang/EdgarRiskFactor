Item 1A. Risk Factors  In addition to the risk factors addressed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, the following risk factors should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of such risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry are Rapidly Evolving and it is Difficult to Predict the Effect New and Proposed Legislation and Regulations will have on the Company’s Business  Credit rating agencies are regulated in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). Currently, Moody’s is designated as an NRSRO pursuant to SEC regulations enacted in response to the adoption of the CRA Reform Act. One of the central promises of the CRA Reform Act was to encourage competition among rating agencies. Given its comparatively recent adoption and the number of additional reforms that have been or will be adopted under the legislative and regulatory initiatives discussed below, Moody’s is unable to accurately assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result or the impact on Moody’s competitive position or its current practices. Possible consequences of recent legislative developments and pending legislative and regulatory initiatives will affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business and may affect Moody’s in a disproportionate manner. Any of these changes could negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, the Company’s ability to compete, or the demand or markets for its products and services in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict.  In the U.S., the recently enacted Financial Reform Act amends a number of laws and regulations, requires the SEC to adopt a number of rules and authorizes a number of studies relating to the operations and legal standards applicable to CRAs. The Financial Reform Act and the rules to be adopted by the SEC in response to the Financial Reform Act may require significant changes to the Company’s business practices, reduce demand for ratings or otherwise affect the Company’s competitive environment and potentially increase the Company’s exposure to litigation. Provisions of the Financial Reform Act and rules that may be adopted by the SEC in furtherance of the Financial Reform Act that pose risks to the Company’s business include, among others:        •    heightened compliance standards;        •    increased disclosure obligations;        •    provisions seeking to diminish investor reliance on credit ratings;        •    the possibility of rules that would mandate disclosure of sensitive issuer information provided to CRAs for the purpose of developing a rating;        •    a mandate that the SEC study the feasibility of establishing a system in which a utility or a self-regulatory organization assigns NRSROs to determine the credit ratings of structured finance products to address so-called “rating-shopping” by issuers and underwriters of structured financial products;        •    rescission of an exemption from expert liability under the Securities Act for ratings information included in registration statements; and        •    changes to the pleading standards and, by repealing Rule 436(g) of the Securities Act, the liability standards under the federal securities laws if a CRA consents to have a rating included in a registration statement or prospectus.  In addition, in October 2009, the SEC proposed a rule providing that, if credit ratings are used in connection with a securities offering that is registered under the Securities Act (which as proposed would include use of a credit rating for certain unregistered securities offerings that are subsequently subject to a registered exchange offer), the ratings must be included in the registration statement. If adopted, this proposal, coupled with the Financial Reform Act’s rescission of Rule 436(g), would mean that common practices used in the U.S. to market and sell securities in such offerings would have to be altered unless CRAs consented to subject themselves to expert liability provisions of the Securities Act with respect to their credit ratings. Adoption of this or a similar rule could impact the volume of securities sold in such offerings, demand for Moody’s ratings, the pricing structure for ratings issued by Moody’s and/or Moody’s exposure to liability and could have other effects that Moody’s is not able to predict, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.  The Financial Reform Act and other initiatives are likely to increase the Company’s cost structure and could alter the Company’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which the Company’s ratings are developed,    57    Table of Contents  assigned and communicated, and affect the demand for and manner in which the Company’s ratings are used and communicated in connection with securities offerings. Each of these effects could alter the Company’s cost and pricing structure (and thus profitability), ability to compete, and the volume of and demand for ratings issued by Moody’s. New pleading and liability standards and other provisions potentially subject CRAs to increased liability, which could increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may result in changes in the demand for credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moody’s operates in ways that cannot presently be predicted.  Further, over the past year, both the G-8 and the G-20 have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. Finance ministers have also agreed to register rating agencies in their home jurisdiction. As a result of the internationally coordinated activity, individual countries have begun implementing registration regimes for the oversight of CRAs in the coming years. In particular, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for rating agencies operating in the EU. The regulation seeks to introduce a common EU regulatory approach to the oversight of CRAs. Its primary objective is to enhance the integrity, transparency, responsibility, governance and reliability of credit rating activities, by establishing conditions for the issuance of credit ratings and rules on the organization and conduct of credit rating agencies. The regulation became fully effective on September 6, 2010. Moody’s applied for registration in last August 2010. These initiatives could negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict.  In addition to the foregoing, in the wake of the credit crisis, legislative and regulatory bodies in both the U.S. and in other countries have adopted or are studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing CRAs and the use of credit ratings, particularly in the area of structured finance securities, and the role of CRAs leading up to the credit crisis. Given the statement the G-20 made in November 2008, it is likely that other jurisdictions will adopt additional laws or regulations affecting Moody’s operations or the markets for its products and services. This could include adopting regulations that affect the need for debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings.  As new laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies rapidly evolve, the costs of compliance can be expected to increase, and Moody’s may not be able to pass on these costs through the pricing of its products. In addition, increased regulatory uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of laws and regulations may increase costs, decrease demand or affect the manner in which Moody’s or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, or alter the economics of the credit ratings business by restricting or mandating the business models under which a CRA is permitted to operate. Moody’s stock price may also be affected by speculation regarding legislative and regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on Moody’s business.  A description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and other countries is described above under the section entitled “Regulation” in Part I, Item 2 of the MD&A of this Form 10-Q.  Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions  Currently, Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities, as part of ongoing investigations, and is responding to those inquiries. In addition, Moody’s faces litigation from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions, as well as other related business practices. Due to the difficult economic times and turbulent markets which the Company has experienced over the last several years, the market value of credit-dependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased, significantly increasing the number of investigations and legal proceedings Moody’s is currently facing. These proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company, which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally, require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues, and, given the number of these proceedings and lawsuits, present a greater risk that Moody’s may be subject to fines or damages, which would be the case if Moody’s is deemed to have violated any laws or regulations. As Moody’s international business expands, these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that currently exist in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the First Amendment) and may pose criminal rather than civil penalties for non-compliance. These risks often are and may continue to be difficult to assess or quantify and we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover them, and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time.  In addition, the recently adopted Financial Reform Act revises pleading and liability standards and other provisions potentially subjecting CRAs to increased liability under securities law claims. This legislation and regulations that will be adopted in light of the Financial Reform Act may result in a material increase in the number of legal proceedings, especially as related to future ratings, and, together with judicial decisions under the Financial Reform Act and under pre-existing legal standards, may increase the potential legal exposure of CRAs. The Company believes that adoption of these provisions could negatively impact credit markets, including causing CRAs to cease to issue ratings on certain securities or issuers, increasing the cost of ratings, delaying issuances of ratings and restricting the public availability of ratings, which changes could materially negatively impact the Company’s business and prospects. It is possible that implementing changes to the Company’s operations to address the changed liability standards may result in lower revenues and/or increased expenses that the Company may not be able to recoup or offset, which could be material, and may not be successful in avoiding or mitigating the impact of the changed liability standard.    58    Table of Contents     Item 2.
