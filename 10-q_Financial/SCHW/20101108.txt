Item 1A. Risk Factors  During the first nine months of 2010, there have been no material changes to the risk factors in “Part I – Item 1A – Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, except for the following addition:  Financial reforms and related regulations may affect the Company’s business activities, financial position and profitability.  The “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” was signed into law on July 21, 2010. This legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. In addition, the legislation mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. CSC is reviewing the impact the legislation will have on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The legislation charges the Federal Reserve with drafting enhanced regulatory requirements for “systemically important” bank holding companies and certain other non-bank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which may include CSC. The enhanced requirements include higher capital, leverage and liquidity standards and numerous other requirements. The legislation permits the Federal Reserve to tailor its enhanced requirements to the perceived riskiness of an individual financial institution. Among other things, the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees, requires the establishment of minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, eliminates the Office of Thrift Supervision, which is currently CSC’s primary regulator, and requires the SEC to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues. As a result, the Federal Reserve will become CSC’s primary regulator and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will become the primary regulator of Schwab Bank. In addition, the legislation contains several provisions that could increase the FDIC deposit insurance premiums paid by the Company.  The legislation also establishes a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will have broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer products, including mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. States will be permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the Bureau.  The changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the Company’s business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, impose upon the Company more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s business. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes.    - 42 -    Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION        Item 2.
