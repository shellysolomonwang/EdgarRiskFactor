Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and include risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. The estimated financial impact of legal and regulatory matters depends upon (1) the successful negotiation, execution, and delivery of definitive agreements in several matters, (2) the ultimate resolution of certain legal matters which are not yet complete, (3) management’s assumptions about the extent to which such amounts may be deducted for tax purposes, (4) the agreement of other necessary parties, and (5) our assumptions about the extent to which we can provide consumer relief to satisfy our financial obligations as contemplated by the agreements in principle with regulators. Additional factors include: our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of NPAs are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may face certain risks as a servicer of loans, or also may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, 79fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; changes which are being considered in the method for determining LIBOR may affect the value of debt securities and other financial obligations held or issued by SunTrust that are linked to LIBOR, or may affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even from inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.INTRODUCTIONThis MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated). We are a leading provider of financial services, particularly in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States, and our headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses both through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and through other national delivery channels. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under three business segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See Note 15, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a description of our business segments. In addition to deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services.The following analysis of our financial performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements, and other information contained in this document and our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements and related information to conform them to the September 30, 2013 presentation. In the MD&A, net interest 80income, net interest margin, total revenue, and efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided in Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data."EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWEconomic and regulatoryModerate improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions, increased household spending, and further strengthening of many housing markets in which we operate continued during the third quarter but was partially offset by further increases in mortgage interest rates and uncertainty surrounding the resolution of the Federal budget and increase in the debt ceiling. Household spending continued to increase as consumer confidence remained near levels last seen in 2008 and consumer borrowing costs remained at relatively low levels. Compared to December 31, 2012, the housing market continued to strengthen as demonstrated by continued price increases, favorable shifts in supply and demand, and some encouraging signs from certain homebuilding activities. However, the rise in mortgage interest rates that began in the second quarter applied pressure on the housing recovery as refinancing activity has significantly slowed and purchase activity remained at a moderate level across the industry. Further, uncertainty remained about the strength of economic growth and the impact on U.S. monetary policy amidst a continued elevated unemployment rate that ended the quarter at 7.3%, only moderately lower than at December 31, 2012. During the third quarter of 2013, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed that a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve conveyed that it anticipates maintaining key interest rates at exceptionally low levels, at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5% and its long-term inflation goals are not met. As a result of executing its monetary policy, the Federal Reserve continues to maintain large portfolios of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and agency MBS with plans to continue adding Treasuries and agency MBS to its portfolio. The Federal Reserve indicated that its asset purchases are not on a preset course and the decision to moderate purchases will be based on close monitoring of economic and financial developments over the coming months and how these developments support any continued improvement in labor market conditions and inflation objectives. Driven in large part by the financial markets' expectations regarding future Federal Reserve monetary policy actions, certain market interest rates increased and the yield curve steepened compared to December 31, 2012; however, in September the yield curve flattened somewhat as a result of the Federal Reserve's decision to not begin tapering its bond buying program. The Federal Reserve outlook includes economic growth that will strengthen from current levels with appropriate policy accommodation, a gradual decline in unemployment, and the expectation of stable longer-term inflation. See additional discussion regarding the increase in interest rates in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" and "Noninterest Income" sections of this MD&A. CapitalDuring the first quarter, we announced capital plans in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR process and completion of the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan. Accordingly, during the third quarter we repurchased $50 million of our common stock. These purchases, along with the $50 million purchased in the second quarter, brings the total repurchases of common stock to $100 million during 2013. Pursuant to our capital plan, we intend to repurchase an additional $100 million of our common stock through the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, during the third quarter, we declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.10 per common share, which is consistent with the second quarter and a $0.05 per common share increase from the third quarter of last year. Our capital remained strong at September 30, 2013 and was well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards, as earnings during the first nine months of the year drove a $759 million increase in our Tier 1 common equity. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio remained strong at 9.94% at September 30, 2013 compared to 10.04% at December 31, 2012. The decline in the ratio compared to year end was primarily due to an increase in RWA as a result of loan growth and a refinement of risk weighting during the third quarter of 2013 for certain unused lending commitments that provide clients' access to standby letters of credit under current regulatory capital rules. This treatment of these particular unused lending commitments is not anticipated to be applicable under the Basel III capital calculation rules and, as a result, had no impact on our current quarter estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.7%. Our Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 10.97% and 13.04%, respectively, compared to 11.13% and 13.48%, respectively, at December 31, 2012, also declining moderately from year end primarily due to the same reasons as the Tier 1 common equity ratio decline. See additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity Risk Management” sections of this MD&A.81The Federal Reserve published final rules in the Federal Register on October 11, 2013 related to capital adequacy requirements to implement the BCBS's Basel III framework for financial institutions in the U.S. The final rules become effective for us on January 1, 2015 and, based on our current analysis of the rules, we believe that our RWA would increase slightly primarily due to increased risk-weightings for commercial real estate, MSRs, and certain on and off balance sheet exposures, resulting in a small decline in our capital ratios. Based on our current and ongoing analysis of the recently published rules, we estimate our current Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, would be approximately 9.7%, which would be in compliance with the capital requirements. See the "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" section in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the estimated Basel III ratio. See additional discussion in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A.Financial performanceNet income available to common shareholders during the third quarter of 2013 was $179 million, or $0.33 per average diluted common share, and included $179 million, or $0.33 per average diluted common share, of net costs related primarily to the resolution of legacy mortgage-related matters and the completion of a taxable reorganization of certain subsidiaries that was discussed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. In comparison, our net income to common shareholders was $1.1 billion, or $1.98 per average diluted common share for the third quarter of 2012; however, the third quarter of 2012 included $753 million of additional net income, or $1.40 per average diluted common share, driven by the early termination of agreements regarding the shares previously owned in The Coca-Cola Company resulting in the sale of those shares, net of certain expenses related to strategic actions taken during the third quarter of last year to strengthen our balance sheet. A summary of the significant items impacting each third quarter was as follows: Three months ended September 30 2013 2012Net income available to common shareholders$179 $1,066Significant items impacting the quarter: Operating losses related to settlement of certain mortgage-related legal matters323 —Mortgage repurchase provision related to GSE repurchase settlements63 —Provision for unrecoverable servicing advances96 —Securities gains related to sale of The Coca-Cola Company stock— (1,938)Mortgage repurchase provision on currently delinquent loans— 371Charitable expense related to The Coca-Cola Company stock contribution— 38Provision for credit losses related to nonperforming loan sales— 172Losses on sale of guaranteed loans— 92Valuation losses related to planned sale of Affordable Housing investments— 96Tax (benefit)/expense related to above items(190) 416Net tax benefit related to subsidiary reorganization and other matters(113) —Net income available to common shareholders, excluding significant items impacting the quarter$358 $313Net income per average common share, diluted$0.33 $1.98Net income per average common share, diluted, excluding significant items impacting the quarter$0.66 $0.58The 2012 items noted above related to strategic actions taken during the third quarter of 2012 to improve our risk profile and strengthen our balance sheet. Further details about these strategic actions can be found in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC on September 6, 2012. The 2013 items noted above primarily related to the resolution of certain legacy mortgage-related and other matters and also included the impact of the completion of a taxable reorganization of certain subsidiaries along with other less significant tax matters. Resolving these matters reduces uncertainty in the mortgage business, improves our overall risk profile, and ultimately allows us to focus on the future of the Company and the opportunities we see in our businesses. Further details about these strategic actions can be found in our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC on October 10, 2013. When excluding the significant items from each quarter's results, our net income and diluted earnings per common share increased 14% from the third quarter of last year as a result of the continued improvement in credit quality and a decline in noninterest expense. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders and net income per average common share, diluted, excluding Form 8-K items.Our provision for credit losses declined 79% in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012 as a result of continued credit quality improvement and the impact in the third quarter of 2012 related to the junior lien policy change. Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2013, excluding the expense impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year 82and last year, improved significantly compared to the same period of last year as a result of our ongoing efficiency improvement efforts as well as the abatement of cyclically high credit-related costs. Total revenue in the third quarter of 2013, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year and last year, decreased compared to the same period of last year due to lower mortgage-related income and net interest income, partially offset by higher wealth management and capital markets revenue in 2013. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of noninterest expense and revenue excluding Form 8-K items. During the first nine months of 2013, net income available to common shareholders was $884 million, or $1.64 per average diluted common share, compared to $1.6 billion, or $2.94 per average diluted common share, during the first nine months of 2012 a decrease of 44%. The results for the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period of last year were also driven by the significant third quarter transactions noted above in both 2013 and 2012. When excluding the Form 8-K items from both periods, net income available to common shareholders increased 28% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, primarily driven by a significantly lower provision for credit losses and moderately lower expenses, offset by lower revenues as a result of the challenging interest rate environment. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders, excluding Form 8-K items. Our asset quality metrics continued to improve during 2013, as NPLs, NPAs, and net charge-offs all declined to six year lows. Total NPLs continued the downward trend from 2012 with a decline of 33% from December 31, 2012, driven by reduced inflows into nonaccrual, continuing resolution of problem loans, and return to accruing status of approximately $235 million of loans previously discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy that exhibited a period of sustained payment performance since being discharged. Declines in NPLs were experienced in most categories, with the largest declines coming from the residential portfolio driven by the Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans returning to accruing status. In the fourth quarter, we expect NPLs will continue to trend lower. Our accruing restructured loan portfolio increased compared to December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans returning to accruing status. However, the accruing restructured portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 96% current on principal and interest payments at September 30, 2013. Early stage delinquencies, a leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, declined during the first nine months of 2013, both in total and when excluding government-guaranteed loan delinquencies. At September 30, 2013, the ALLL was 1.67% of total loans, a decline of 13 basis points compared to December 31, 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased 80% and net charge-offs decreased 71% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. The provision for loan losses was down 58% and net charge-offs decreased 57% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012. The declines were the result of improved credit quality as well as the incremental $172 million of charge-offs and provision recorded in the third quarter of 2012 related to NPL sales and the $65 million related to the junior lien credit policy change. Annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 0.47% and 0.61% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, a decline of 117 and 78 basis points from the same periods in 2012, respectively, driven by decreases in charge-offs within each loan segment including the incremental charge-offs related to NPL sales in the third quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter, we expect net charge-offs will remain relatively stable compared to the third quarter. Overall, the improved credit metrics have been driven by fewer delinquencies and lower loss severities. We continue to anticipate future improvements in our overall asset quality would likely be driven by residential loans, as the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized levels. As asset quality metrics approach more normalized levels, we expect the positive impacts on net income resulting from quarterly declines in net charge-offs and the ALLL to abate. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Nonperforming Assets,” sections of this MD&A.Average loans decreased 1% during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods of 2012. The declines during these periods were a result of lower federally guaranteed student and residential mortgage loan balances due primarily to sales in the second half of 2012, predominantly offset by growth in C&I loans and our consumer portfolio, excluding guaranteed student loans. Also driving the decline in average loans in both periods was the significant decrease in average NPLs, down over $1 billion, primarily due to our continued resolution efforts and NPL sales in 2012. Average loans increased 1% sequentially as a result of increases in almost all loan categories, led by CRE and nonguaranteed residential mortgage loans. The percentage of our total loan portfolio that is government-guaranteed was 7% at September 30, 2013. We remain committed to providing financing and fulfilling the credit needs in the communities that we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers. To that end, during the first nine months of 2013, we extended approximately $73 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients, an increase of 10% from the first nine months of 2012. Overall, while loan demand remains moderate, our commercial loan pipelines continue to increase and overall economic indicators in our markets continue to gradually improve.Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% during both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. The increase during both periods was primarily the result of the continued increase in lower cost deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease in higher cost time deposits. Specifically, the increase during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was driven by an increase of $3.5 billion in lower-cost accounts with the increases 83spread across all categories and led by money market accounts, while the increase during the nine months of 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by an increase of $4.1 billion in lower-cost accounts, with increases in all categories and led by noninterest-bearing DDAs. Average time deposits declined 14% and 16%  from the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively, as a result of the mix shift from higher cost to lower cost deposits. The increase and mix shift over the prior year periods in average consumer and commercial deposits resulted in a 12 and 17 basis point reduction in interest-bearing deposit costs compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively, and allowed us to further reduce our wholesale and short-term borrowings. Specifically, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, we reduced our higher-cost wholesale funding sources, primarily long-term debt, on average, by 16% and 21%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. Additionally, we reduced our average other short-term borrowings, including short-term FHLB advances, by 22% and 37% compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively. See additional discussions in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" and "Borrowings" sections of this MD&A.Total revenue, on an FTE basis, decreased 50% and 26% compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively. The decline was predominantly driven by securities gains in the third quarter of 2012 related to the Coke transaction. Total revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year and last year decreased, 22% and 12% compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The decrease was due to lower mortgage-related income and net interest income, partially offset by higher wealth management and capital markets revenue. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of revenue, excluding Form 8-K items. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, decreased 5% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, due to a decrease in our commercial loan swap-related income and the continued low interest rate environment contributing to lower earning asset yields, partially offset by favorable shifts in the deposit mix, lower deposit rates, and the reduction in long-term debt. The first nine months of 2012 also included $31 million of dividends on previously owned Coke shares. Our net interest margin was 3.19% for the third quarter of 2013, compared to 3.38% for the third quarter of 2012 and was 3.25% during the first nine months of 2013 compared to 3.42% during the same period in 2012. The decline in net interest margin was due to the same factors as noted in the decline in net interest income. We expect net interest margin to decline in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace when compared to the decline in the third quarter from the second quarter. See additional discussion related to net interest margin in the "Net Interest Income/Margin," section of this MD&A.Noninterest income decreased 73% and 45% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively, driven primarily by the securities gains in 2012 related to the Coke stock transaction. Noninterest income during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year and last year decreased, 30% and 15% compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The decreases in both periods were driven by a decline in mortgage-related revenue as a result of a decline in production volume, lower gain on sale margins as a result of higher interest rates, and a decline in net MSR hedge performance. Partially offsetting the decrease in both periods was higher wealth management and capital markets revenue, as well as a decline in mark-to-market valuation losses on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs in both periods of 2013 compared to 2012. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of noninterest income, excluding Form 8-K items. Noninterest expense increased 1% and decreased 6% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The increase during the quarter was driven by the expenses related to resolution of legacy mortgage-related matters, while the decrease during the nine months was driven by efficiency improvements that caused a decline in most expense categories, as well as the abatement of cyclically high credit-related and legal and consulting expenses. Noninterest expense, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year and last year, decreased 17% and 13%, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by decreases across most categories as a result of efficiency improvements and the abatement of cyclically high credit-related and legal and consulting costs. Compensation and benefits expense contributed to the decline in the third quarter of 2013 due to the reversal of previously accrued compensation and benefits expense as a result of lower corporate profitability during the current quarter while the third quarter of last year included an increase in incentive compensation cost due to the acceleration of deferred compensation related to organizational changes in certain businesses. Also contributing to the decline in compensation and benefits expense during the current quarter was lower salary expense due to a 6% decline in full time equivalent employees compared to September 30, 2012 partially driven by changes to our branch staffing as client adoption of mobile technology increased. Other real estate expense declined in the current quarter due to increased gains on sales of owned properties while operating expenses and loss provisioning related to owned properties declined. Consulting and legal expenses declined due to the completion of certain mortgage regulatory-related projects, and other noninterest expense decreased due to higher severance expense and expenses related to corporate real estate assets in the third quarter of 2012. The decreases during the first nine months of 2013 were driven by decreases in most categories with significant declines in employee compensation and benefits expense and other real estate expense, and to a lesser extent by decreases in consulting and legal expenses, regulatory assessments, and other noninterest expenses. Declines in employee compensation and benefits, other real 84estate, consulting and legal and other noninterest expense were due to the same factors as described for the quarter. The decrease in regulatory assessments was due to an improvement in our FDIC insurance assessment rate, reflective of our reduced risk profile. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of noninterest expense, excluding Form 8-K items.Compared to the second quarter of 2013, net income available to common shareholders decreased 51%, driven primarily by the Form 8-K items impacting the third quarter of 2013 and reduced mortgage production income partially offset by a 35% decrease in the provision for credit losses. Net income available to common shareholders decreased 2% compared to the second quarter of 2013, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarter of this year. Net interest income was relatively unchanged as lower net interest margin was offset by higher average earning assets. However, revenue declined during the quarter predominantly due to lower core mortgage income due to declines in production volumes and lower gain on sale margins that were driven by the increase in mortgage rates and industry competition. Also impacting revenue was a decrease in origination fees from lower closed loan volume and the impairment of certain lease financing assets in the current quarter. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in capital markets and wealth management income, as well as an increase in mortgage servicing income due largely to a slower pace of loan prepayments as rising interest rates resulted in less refinance volume and therefore less decay of the mortgage servicing asset. Servicing income is expected to increase in the fourth quarter as refinance volume further declines. Noninterest expense increased $346 million, or 25%, during the quarter entirely due to the legacy mortgage-related expenses as well as the increase in the mortgage servicing advance reserve, both part of the third quarter Form 8-K items. Noninterest expense declined 5% from the second quarter of 2013, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarter of this year. The decrease in noninterest expense was due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense driven by the current quarter reversal of previously accrued compensation and benefits due to the lower corporate profitability during the quarter. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders and noninterest expense, excluding Form 8-K items.  Business segments highlightsNet income improved during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 in Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management compared to the same periods in 2012. Reductions in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense offset lower revenue to drive the substantial increase in net income. Revenue was moderately lower during the three and nine month periods of 2013 compared to 2012 driven by the sale of $2 billion of government guaranteed student loans in 2012, partially offset by solid growth in fee income due to increased fixed annuity sales, which benefited from higher rates, and strong growth in our managed account business within the brokerage platform. Loan production increased 6% from September 30, 2012 as a result of solid organic loan growth. The improvement in credit quality, most notably in our home equity portfolio, as well as an increase in the provision in the prior year due to a change in our credit policy related to the charge-off of junior lien loans drove the 54% and 38% decrease in the provision for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The reduction in expenses during 2013 was driven by changes to our branch staffing model and retail branch network due to clients increasingly utilizing self-service channels. Our retail branch network decreased 8% from September 30, 2012 due to our efforts to better align our branch network and staffing levels in response to client preferences, and while we expect further declines in our branch network in the future, the overall rate of decline will be slower. The decrease in expenses drove the 399 and 305 basis point improvements in our efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios, respectively, compared to the first nine months of 2012.  Wholesale Banking reported strong results during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 that included substantially improved net income compared to the same periods of 2012 that was led by increased net interest income and decreases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. While total revenue was lower in 2013 due to weaker trading income and a leasing asset impairment, net interest income increased 4% and 5% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2012 as a result of solid average loan growth of 6% in both periods. Loan growth was driven by not-for-profit and government lending, core CRE, and our large corporate lending areas, most notably asset securitization, asset-based lending, and our energy industry lending. Further credit quality improvement in our CRE portfolio in 2013 and the elevated provision in 2012 due to the charge-offs related to the nonperforming CRE loans sales drove a 70% and 69% decrease in the provision for credit losses compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively. Noninterest expenses decreased 17% and 14% compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, resulting in significant reductions in both efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios to below 60%. Mortgage Banking results were driven by the Form 8-K items for the third quarters of this year and last year. These items combined to account for a significant portion of the net loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. Excluding these Form 8-K items, we had a modest improvement in net loss as provision for credit losses and noninterest expense decreased significantly during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," for a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders, provision for credit losses, 85noninterest income, and noninterest expense, excluding Form 8-K items. The decrease in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, excluding the Form 8-K items, was the result of improved credit quality and a continued improvement in the operating environment. Noninterest income, excluding the Form 8-K items, decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 and was driven by lower current year mortgage revenue due to a decline in production volume and gain on sale margins which were due to the increase in mortgage rates and a decline in mortgage servicing income due to lower net hedge performance partially offset by a lower mortgage repurchase provision. As expected, the refinance volume continued to abate significantly during the third quarter of 2013, but our home purchase volume increased 47% and 16% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. However, we expect further declines in overall closed loan production volume in the fourth quarter as a result of a sharp decline in applications in the third quarter. We are being aggressive in right-sizing our mortgage business, both as a result of continued resolution of legacy matters and as a response to the current origination environment. As a result, we intend to reduce our mortgage staff by approximately 20%, which translates to roughly 800 full-time equivalent employees. We believe this action, along with resolution of certain legacy mortgage-related matters, better positions us for the future and continues our focus of being a more efficient organization. Additional information related to performance of our segments during the year can be found in Note 15, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and further discussion of segment results for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, can be found in the "Business Segment Results" section of this MD&A.86SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA   Table 1 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions, except per share data)2013 2012 2013 2012Summary of Operations:       Interest income$1,339 $1,445 $4,045 $4,471Interest expense131 174 405 615Net interest income1,208 1,271 3,640 3,856Provision for credit losses95 450 453 1,067Net interest income after provision for credit losses1,113 821 3,187 2,789Noninterest income680 2,542 2,401 4,358Noninterest expense1,743 1,726 4,503 4,813Income before provision for income taxes50 1,637 1,085 2,334(Benefit)/provision for income taxes(146) 551 151 710Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest7 9 16 22Net income$189 $1,077 $918 $1,602Net income available to common shareholders$179 $1,066 $884 $1,581Net income available to common shareholders, excluding Form 8-K items 10$358 $313 $1,063 $828        Net interest income -

Total Revenue is calculated as net interest income - FTE plus noninterest income. Net interest income is presented on an FTE basis, which adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. We also believe that revenue and noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.2Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.3We present a tangible efficiency ratio, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.4We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.5We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.6We present a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.7Primarily relates to the impacts of mortgage servicing assets essentially offset by certain disallowed DTAs.8The Basel III calculations of common equity Tier 1, RWA, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio are based upon our current interpretation of the final Basel III rules published by the Federal Reserve in October 2013, on a fully phased in basis.9The largest differences between our RWA as calculated under Basel I compared to Basel III relate to the risk-weightings for certain commercial loans, unfunded commitments, and mortgage servicing assets.10 SunTrust presents certain income statement categories and also total revenue-FTE, net income per average common diluted share, net income, net income available to common shareholders, an efficiency ratio, a tangible efficiency ratio, and the effective tax rate, excluding Form 8-K items. We believe these measures are useful to investors because it removes the effect of material items impacting the quarter's results allowing a more useful comparison to other quarters' results that did not have a similar impact and is more reflective of normalized operations as it reflects results that are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. Removing these items also allows investors to compare our results to other companies in the industry that may not have had similar items impacting their results.

The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $93 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 3Income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. 4Derivative instruments that manage our interest-sensitivity position increased net interest income $334 million and $404 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.93            Net Interest Income/MarginThird Quarter of 2013Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $1.2 billion for the third quarter of 2013, a decrease of $61 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by lower earning asset yields, as a result of the low interest rate environment, the impact of loan sales in the second half of 2012, and a reduction in our commercial loan swap-related income. These factors were partially offset by lower rates paid on deposits, reductions in our long-term debt, and a continued favorable shift in the deposit mix. These factors, coupled with a slight increase in average earning assets, caused net interest margin to decrease 19 basis points to 3.19% during the third quarter of 2013, compared to 3.38% during the third quarter of 2012. Average earning assets increased by $1.0 billion, or 1%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, predominantly driven by an increase of $2.0 billion, or 9%, in our average securities AFS portfolio, partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 1%, reduction in average loans. The decline in average loans was largely due to sales of government guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans during 2012. Average nonaccrual loans also declined 54%, driven by ongoing credit quality improvement and the sales of NPLs during 2012. These decreases were partially offset by growth in C&I loans of $2.7 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by our large corporate and middle market borrowers, and consumer loans, excluding guaranteed student loans, which increased approximately 6% compared to the third quarter of 2012.Yields on earning assets declined 30 basis points to 3.53% during the third quarter of 2013, compared to 3.83% during the third quarter of 2012. The yield on our loan portfolio during the third quarter of 2013 was 3.81%, a decrease of 31 basis points, and our securities AFS portfolio yielded 2.52%, down 26 basis points from the third quarter of 2012. The yield declines were primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and, for loans specifically, by the lower commercial loan swap-related income.We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The largest notional position of these swaps are pay variable-receive fixed interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. At September 30, 2013, the outstanding notional balance of active swaps was $17.3 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared to $17.4 billion at September 30, 2012. In addition to the income recognized from currently outstanding swaps, we also continue to recognize interest income over the original hedge period resulting from terminated or de-designated swaps that were previously designated as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans. Swap-related interest income declined to $101 million during the third quarter of 2013 from $118 million during the same period in 2012. The $17 million decline was primarily due to a decline in income from the maturity of $2.1 billion of active swaps during the second quarter of 2013 and $9.0 billion of previously terminated swaps that reached their original maturity date during 2012 and 2013. We added $2.0 billion of new pay variable-receive fixed commercial loan swaps in the second quarter of 2013 after interest rates increased, which aided net interest income in the third quarter of 2013 and is expected to continue to have a positive effect on net interest income in the near-term. As we manage our interest rate risk we may purchase and/or terminate additional interest rate swaps. Our notional balance of active swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of 2014 with remaining maturities through 2018, absent any additions or terminations. The average maturity of our active swap notional balances at September 30, 2013 was 2.2 years and $12.5 billion of our active swap notional balances will mature by December 31, 2016. As the swap balances mature, the interest income from the swap balances is expected to decline and our overall asset sensitivity position is expected to increase.The commercial loan swaps have a fixed rate of interest that is received, while the rate paid is based on LIBOR. Estimated quarterly income of these swaps based on current expectations of future LIBOR rates is as follows:    Table 3       Ending NotionalBalances of Active Swaps(in billions) Estimated IncomeRelated to Swaps(in millions)Fourth Quarter 2013 $17.3 $101First Quarter of 2014 17.3 101Second Quarter 2014 16.1 97Third Quarter 2014 16.1 91Fourth Quarter 2014 12.6 7794Average interest-bearing liabilities during the quarter decreased $2.8 billion, or 3%, from the third quarter of 2012 and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities were 0.48%, a decrease of 14 basis points. The decrease was predominantly a result of a $2.2 billion, or 14%, decrease in average higher-cost time deposits, a $1.8 billion, or 16%, reduction in average long-term debt, and a $1.4 billion, or 22%, reduction in average other short-term borrowings. These were partially offset by an increase of $2.7 billion, or 4%, in lower cost average deposits. The continued shift in the deposit mix toward lower cost deposit products from higher cost products also included an increase of $774 million, or 2%, in average demand deposits compared to the third quarter of 2012. The decline in average long-term debt was primarily attributable to the redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities during the third quarter of 2012, which had a weighted average rate of approximately 7%, as well as the extinguishment of a $1.0 billion FHLB advance and $1.2 billion of senior notes related to the Coke transaction in 2012. Partially offsetting these declines, we took advantage of the lower interest rates early in the second quarter of 2013 and issued $600 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.75% coupon. We also issued $750 million of 5-year senior notes at a 2.35% coupon in October 2013, further leveraging an opportunity to secure long-term debt at a low interest rate. Additionally, we added $600 million of new pay variable-receive fixed long term debt swaps in the second quarter of 2013 that aided net interest income in the third quarter of 2013 and is expected to continue to have a positive effect on net interest income in the near-term. The reduction in average other short-term borrowings was due to a reduction in short-term FHLB advances during 2013 and the second half of 2012. The decrease of 14 basis points on rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the third quarter of 2012 was primarily driven by a 17 basis point decline in rates paid on long-term debt, driven by the aforementioned redemption and extinguishments, and a 12 basis point decline in rates paid on total interest bearing deposits, which included an 11 basis point decrease in consumer and commercial deposits. The decline in the overall rate paid on consumer and commercial deposits was a result of the improved funding mix driven by the shift from higher cost deposit products to lower cost deposit products, as well as overall market interest rates.During the third quarter of 2013, the interest rate environment was characterized by a steepening in the yield curve versus the third quarter of 2012, as rates at the long end of the yield curve increased. More specifically, during the third quarter of 2013, benchmark rates were as follows compared to third quarter of 2012: one-month LIBOR averaged 0.19%, a decrease of 5 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.26%, a decrease of 17 basis points, five-year swaps averaged 1.67%, an increase of 81 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 2.88%, an increase of 115 basis points. During the third quarter of 2013, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25% and the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, both unchanged from the third quarter of 2012. Looking forward, we expect the net interest margin to decline in the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced this quarter. However, in the coming quarters, assuming current rates remain unchanged, we expect the steeper yield curve to help mitigate the declining trend in net interest margin, as well as provide an increasing benefit to net interest income over time. Specifically, the steeper curve is beneficial to spread income and the positive benefit should be noticed in our financial results over time as existing loans and securities provide cash flows that we can redeploy at higher yields.First Nine Months of 2013For the first nine months of 2013, net interest income was $3.7 billion, a decrease of $216 million, or 5%, compared to the first nine months of 2012. The decrease was predominantly driven by the same factors as discussed above for the third quarter related to lower asset yields and a reduction in commercial loan swap-related income. Also contributing to the decrease in net interest income during the nine months of 2013 is the elimination of the Coke dividend income during the third quarter of 2012 and lower average earning assets.Average earning assets decreased by $824 million, or 1%. The decrease was driven by a reduction of $1.7 billion, or 1%, in average loans, partially offset by increases of $445 million, or 14%, in average LHFS and $206 million, or 24%, in average fed funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. The factors contributing to the year-over-year decline in average loans were the same as those discussed related to the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $6.0 billion, or 5%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, predominantly due to a $2.8 billion, or 37%, reduction in other short-term borrowings, a $2.8 billion, or 16%, decrease in higher-cost time deposits, and a $2.6 billion, or 21%, reduction in long-term debt. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.2 billion, or 3%, in lower cost interest-bearing deposits. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, and included an increase of $1.8 billion, or 5%, in demand deposits, as well as the increase in the aforementioned lower cost interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the decrease in higher-cost time deposits, reflecting the continued shift toward lower cost deposit products. The factors contributing to the year-over-year reduction in average other short-term borrowings and average long-term debt were the same as those discussed related to the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012.95The net interest margin was 3.25%, a decline of 17 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Yields on average earning assets declined 34 basis points to 3.61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, from 3.95% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The average yield on securities AFS was 2.53%, down 52 basis points from the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities, reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower yields, and the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock, drove the decline in yield on securities AFS. Also contributing to the decline in yields on average earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was a 31 basis point decline in average loan yields, as well as a 23 basis point decline in yields on LHFS, primarily due to the low interest rate environment, and a $75 million decline in our commercial loan swap-related income. Offsetting the decline in the yield on average earning assets, was a decrease of 22 basis points on rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, primarily driven by a 51 basis point decline in rates paid on long-term debt as we were able to repay higher cost debt with our lower cost deposits and available cash position. A 14 basis point decline in rates paid on consumer and commercial deposits also contributed to the decrease in interest bearing liability rates paid and was also a result of the improved funding mix driven by the shift from higher cost deposit products to lower cost deposit products, as well as an overall decline in market interest rates.Foregone InterestForegone interest income from NPLs reduced the net interest margin by 2 basis points during the third quarter of 2013 and 3 basis points during the first nine months of 2013, compared to a reduction of 7 basis points and 9 basis points during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively, as average nonaccrual loans decreased by $1.3 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. See additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.2 PIN interchange fees are presented in card fees along with other interchange fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013. Previously, these PIN interchange fees were presented in other charges and fees and therefore, for comparative purposes, interchange fees have been reclassified to card fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively.3 See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," in this MD&A for a reconciliation of noninterest income excluding Form 8-K items.  Noninterest income decreased $1.9 billion, or 73% compared to the third quarter of 2012 and decreased $2.0 billion, or 45%, during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 driven primarily by securities gains in 2012 related to the Coke stock transaction, which was part of our Form 8-K items in the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year and last year, noninterest income decreased $324 million, or 30%, compared to the third quarter of 2012 and $419 million, or 15%, compared to the first nine months in 2012. The decreases in both periods were driven by a decline in mortgage-related revenue as a result of a decline in production volume and gain on sale margins and a decline in net MSR hedge performance. Partially offsetting the decrease in both periods was higher 96wealth management and capital markets revenue, as well as a decline in mark-to-market valuation losses on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs in both periods of 2013 compared to 2012. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," in this MD&A for a reconciliation of noninterest income, excluding Form 8-K items. Other charges and fees decreased during the third quarter of 2013 by $6 million, or 6%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased by $28 million, or 9%, during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of the prior year. The decreases were due to lower insurance premium income due to a reduction in reinsurance agreements with mortgage insurance companies and lower letter of credit and loan commitment fee income. Investment banking income was $99 million during the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $16 million, or 19%, compared to the third quarter of the prior year, and $260 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $30 million, or 13%, compared to the first nine months of 2012. The increases in both periods were driven by growth in merger and acquisition advisory and equity transaction fee revenue as well as syndication and bond origination activity for the nine month period. Trust and investment management income increased $6 million, or 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2012 as a result of solid market conditions and deepening client relationships, while retail investment services income increased 13% and 10% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively, due to solid market conditions and growth in managed accounts.Trading income increased $14 million, or 74%, during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $21 million, or 14%, during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012. The increase in the current quarter was largely driven by a decline in mark-to-market valuation losses on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs, partially offset by a decline in core trading income, which was impacted by reduced client fixed income trading volume. The decrease during the first nine months of 2013 compared to prior year was due to lower core trading income impacted by higher interest rates, partially offset by the decline in mark-to-market valuation losses on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs.Mortgage production related income increased $54 million, or 84%, during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, and $180 million during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012 due primarily to the decline in the mortgage repurchase provision (discussed further below), partially offset by reduced gain on sale margins and lower lock volume associated with a drop in applications. The gain on sale margin compression was a result of industry competition and the impact of higher interest rates on post-lock activity. Loan originations during the third quarter of 2013 totaled $8.0 billion compared to $8.1 billion for the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of $137 million, or 2%. However, loan originations during the first nine months of 2013 were $25.9 billion compared to $24.1 billion during the first nine months of the prior year, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 8%, driven by refinance volume as a result of low interest rates during the early part of 2013. Mortgage production during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 was comprised of approximately 54% and 67%, respectively, in refinance activity; approximately 12% and 18% of the total refinance production activity for the current quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, related to the HARP 2.0 program. However, due to the increase in market interest rates, we expect the refinance volume, including HARP refinancing, to continue to decline in the fourth quarter of 2013. Purchase volume, on the other hand, increased 47% from the third quarter of 2012 and 16% from the first nine months of 2012, but at lower absolute levels than refinance volume. While purchase volume is not currently at levels that will offset the expected decline in refinances, it will provide some mitigation. Application volume in the current quarter was 44% lower than the third quarter of 2012 and 45% lower compared to the prior quarter. As a result, we expect overall production volume to continue to decline in the fourth quarter of 2013, given the sharp decline in third quarter application activity.The mortgage repurchase provision for the third quarter of 2013 was $73 million, a decrease of $298 million, compared to the third quarter of 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, the mortgage repurchase provision was $102 million, a decrease of $599 million, compared to the same period of the prior year. The lower provision was predominantly driven by the third quarter of 2012 increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve; the result of information received during the third quarter of 2012 from the GSEs and our experience related to demands, both of which enhanced our ability to estimate losses related to remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre-2009 GSEs loan sales. The lower provision was partially offset by the $63 million provision in the third quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the resolution of GSE mortgage repurchase claims related to certain existing and future repurchase obligations. During the third quarter of 2013, we reached agreements with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae under which Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae released us from certain existing and future repurchase obligations for loans sold to Freddie Mac between 2000 and 2008 and Fannie Mae between 2000 and 2012. While the majority of both repurchase settlements was covered by our existing mortgage repurchase reserve, we increased the provision in the third quarter of 2013 by $63 million as a result of these settlements, as the population of loans included under the agreements was broader than the population of loans considered under our existing mortgage repurchase reserve. The reserve for mortgage repurchases was $281 million at September 30, 2013, a decrease of $351 million from December 31, 2012, resulting from the recognition of losses on resolved repurchase requests and the resolution of legacy mortgage matters during the current quarter, which included the payment to Freddie Mac under the settlement agreement. Subsequently, during 97October 2013, the reserve for mortgage repurchases declined significantly as a result of the cash payment made to Fannie Mae associated with the settlement agreement. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 12, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Mortgage servicing related income decreased $53 million, or 83%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and $165 million, or 77%, compared to the first nine months of the prior year. The decreases were primarily due to less favorable net hedge performance, an increase in the decay of the servicing asset, and a smaller servicing portfolio resulting in lower servicing fees. Net hedge performance is highly sensitive to the market interest rate environment, which became volatile and increased during the second quarter of 2013. As a result of the higher interest rate environment, our hedge became only slightly accretive to income during the current quarter and first nine months of 2013. However, with the decline in refinance volume during the third quarter due to rising interest rates, the level of prepayments and resultant decay in the servicing asset declined. We expect servicing income to increase in the fourth quarter, as refinance volume further declines and decay of the servicing asset is expected to decline. At September 30, 2013, the servicing portfolio was $139.7 billion compared to $149.7 billion at September 30, 2012. The decline was driven by the sales of servicing on certain loans in the servicing portfolio and the elevated level of refinance activity.Net securities gains decreased by $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion respectively, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the early termination of agreements regarding our previously owned shares of Coke stock during the third quarter of 2012 resulting in a $1.9 billion gain.Other noninterest income increased $41 million during the third quarter of 2013 and $20 million during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to a $92 million loss recognized in the third quarter of 2012 upon transfer to LHFS of guaranteed student and mortgage loans to be sold, partially offset by a $37 million lease financing asset impairment in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of updated market indicators of the residual values of certain assets. For additional information on the lease financing impairment, see Note 13, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Additionally, gains on the sale of leases declined during 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.2 See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," in this MD&A for a reconciliation of noninterest expense excluding Form 8-K items.Noninterest expense increased $17 million, or 1%, and decreased $310 million, or 6%, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively, driven primarily by expenses related to resolution of legacy mortgage-related matters included in our Form 8-K items during the third quarter of 2013, while the decrease during 98the nine months was driven by efficiency improvements that caused a decline in most expense categories, as well as the abatement of cyclically high credit-related and consulting costs. Noninterest expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, excluding the impact from the Form 8-K items from the third quarters of this year and last year decreased $268 million, or 17%, and $595 million, or 13%, compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The decline in expenses in both periods was driven by lower personnel expenses due to improved efficiency resulting in lower staffing levels, a decline in other real estate expense due to a decline in valuation losses and increase in gain on sales, and a reduction in regulatory assessments due to our improved risk profile. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," in this MD&A for a reconciliation of noninterest expense, excluding Form 8-K items. Personnel expenses decreased $98 million, or 13%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $162 million, or 7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The decrease for both periods was largely attributable to a reduction in full-time equivalent employees and lower incentive compensation and benefits. Full time equivalent employees have declined by 6% compared to September 30, 2012 as a result of efficiency improvements, particularly in our branch staffing. Additionally, $37 million of accrued incentive compensation and benefits was reversed in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of lower corporate profitability during the quarter while the third quarter of last year included an increase in incentive compensation cost due to the acceleration of deferred compensation related to organizational changes in certain businesses.Operating losses increased $279 million compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $261 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, due to specific mortgage-related legal matters that were resolved in the third quarter of 2013. Specifically, we reached agreements in principle with the HUD and the United States Department of Justice to settle certain civil and administrative claims related to our origination of FHA-insured mortgage loans and our portion of the National Mortgage Servicing Settlement, which pertains to mortgage servicing and origination practices. Collectively, these two mattersresulted in the majority of operating losses recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013. We face several risks from these settlements, including that if we are unable to meet certain consumer relief commitments, then our costs to resolve these matters will likely increase. See further discussion of these matters in Note 14, "Contingencies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Part II, "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in this Form 10-Q. The operating losses related to these two matters were partially offset by declines related to other mortgage-related matters.Credit and collection services expense increased $74 million compared to the third quarter of 2012, and increased $43 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, driven by a $96 million charge primarily due to an increase in the mortgage servicing advance reserve in the third quarter of 2013. We increased the reserve as a result of an expanded review of our servicing advance practices and a separate agreement for the sale of MSRs on approximately $1 billion in unpaid principal balances of predominantly delinquent mortgage loans. As a result of the review of servicing advances and the MSR sale, we refined our loss estimates and valuation methodologies to incorporate loss estimates on all advances while the prior methodology centered on aged advances. Partially offsetting this increase in the servicing advance reserve was declines in credit and collection costs as a result of the decline in NPAs.Regulatory assessments decreased $22 million, or 33%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $39 million, or 22%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012 due to declines in our FDIC insurance assessment rate, reflecting our reduced risk profile. Partially offsetting the decrease were additional regulatory supervisory fees imposed in the current quarter.Marketing and customer development expense decreased $41 million, or 55%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $39 million, or 29%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as a result of our charitable contribution of previously owned Coke shares during the third quarter of 2012.Other staff expense decreased $19 million, or 46%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $29 million, or 39%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, driven by declines in severance expenses, despite the current quarter including the estimated severance related to the recently announced reductions in employees in our mortgage business. See additional discussion in the "Executive Overview" section of this MD&A.Consulting and legal expenses decreased $21 million, or 53%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $64 million, or 55%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, predominantly due to the elimination of certain expenses associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review that was part of the Consent Order. We entered into an Amendment to the Consent Order in February 2013 that allowed us to begin eliminating consulting and legal costs of independent third parties providing file review, borrower outreach, and legal services associated with the Consent Order foreclosure file review. For additional information regarding the Consent Order and the Amendment, see Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.99Other real estate expense decreased $26 million, or 87%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $129 million, or 97%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The decrease was predominantly due to a decline in valuation losses and an increase in gains on sales. It is unlikely that gains will continue to largely offset expenses, so future quarterly expenses may increase from the current level, but as the economic environment improves over time, we expect that other real estate expense will continue to be notably lower than the elevated levels during 2012.Other noninterest expense decreased by $105 million, or 46%, compared to the third quarter of 2012, and decreased $134 million, or 29%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The decreases were primarily due to specific strategic actions in the third quarter of 2012, including a $96 million valuation loss related to the planned sale of affordable housing investments and $17 million in real estate charges as we reassessed some of our corporate real estate leases and holdings. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. The provision for income taxes was a benefit of $146 million and an expense of $151 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2013, that was not meaningful when calculated, compared to an effective tax rate of 14%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for income taxes was $551 million and $710 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 34% and 31%, respectively. After excluding the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 Form 8-K items, the effective tax rate was 30% and 29%, during the third quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 29% and 26% during the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data," in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate excluding Form 8-K items.The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, was primarily attributable to lower pre-tax income, due to the Form 8-K items, as well as the tax benefit realized on the completion of a taxable reorganization of certain subsidiaries. This tax benefit was partially offset by an increase in STM’s valuation allowance related to its DTAs for certain state NOLs and an increase in the liability for UTBs.The provision for income taxes differs from the provision using statutory rates primarily due to favorable permanent tax items such as income from lending to tax exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. See Note 9, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further information on the provision for income taxes.LOANSOur disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the related credit reserves (i) describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, (ii) provide information on how we analyze and assess credit risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate ALLL, and (iii) explain the changes in the ALLL and reasons for those changes. We disclose our loan portfolio by segment and/or by type of loan, which is how we document our method for determining our ALLL. Loan types are further categorizations of our portfolio segments.We report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, purpose, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, which further disaggregate loans based upon common risk characteristics.CommercialThe C&I loan type includes loans to fund business operations or activities, corporate credit cards, loans secured by owner-occupied properties, and other wholesale lending activities. CRE and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial and construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as C&I loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner-occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.ResidentialResidential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans, both guaranteed and nonguaranteed. Residential construction loans include owner-occupied residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or junior lien position. At September 30, 2013, 37% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 63% were in a junior 100lien position. For home equity products in a junior lien position, we own or service 29% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product. Only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to end their draw period and convert to an amortizing term loan during 2013, with 91% of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in 2015 or later and 60% in 2017 or later. Historically, a majority of accounts have not converted to amortization. Based on historical trends, within 12 months of the end of their draw period, approximately 79% of accounts, and approximately 67% of accounts with a balance, are closed or refinanced. We perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure. These activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity junior lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent, including when the junior lien is still current. We monitor the delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by other parties. Additionally, we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores of borrowers with junior liens, as these scores are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency. At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, our home equity junior lien loss severity was approximately 87% and 92%, respectively. ConsumerThe loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct (consisting primarily of direct auto loans, loans secured by negotiable collateral, and private student loans), indirect (consisting of loans secured by automobiles or recreational vehicles), and consumer credit cards.                  The composition of our loan portfolio is shown in the following table:Loan Portfolio by Types of Loans    Table 6(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 % ChangeCommercial loans:     C&I$55,943 $54,048 4 %CRE4,755 4,127 15Commercial construction737 713 3Total commercial loans61,435 58,888 4Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - guaranteed3,527 4,252 (17)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed124,106 23,389 3Home equity products14,826 14,805 —Residential construction582 753 (23)Total residential loans43,041 43,199 —Consumer loans:     Guaranteed student loans5,489 5,357 2Other direct2,670 2,396 11Indirect11,035 10,998 —Credit cards670 632 6Total consumer loans 19,864 19,383 2LHFI$124,340 $121,470 2 %LHFS$2,462 $3,399 (28)%1Includes $316 million and $379 million of loans carried at fair value at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. As seen below in Table 7, we have experienced a shift in our loans by geography since December 31, 2012. Specifically, the percentage of our loans to clients in the Central region has decreased and loans to clients in our Other region has increased. The Central decrease was related specifically to a decrease in loan activity in the state of Georgia, while the increase in Other was related to an increase in loans in our CIB business which serves clients nationwide. See Note 4, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.101The following table shows the percentage breakdown of our total LHFI portfolio by geographic region:Loan Types by Geography         Table 7 Commercial Residential Consumer September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Geography:           Central123% 27% 21% 21% 15% 15%Florida219 19 25 26 18 19MidAtlantic325 25 39 38 25 26Other33 29 15 15 42 40Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%1 The Central region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.2 The Florida region includes Florida only.3 The MidAtlantic region includes the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.Loans Held for InvestmentLHFI were $124.3 billion at September 30, 2013, an increase of 2% from December 31, 2012. We continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy, as we were successful in both growing targeted commercial balances and in reducing our exposure to certain higher risk residential construction loans. Continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios resulted in a net $147 million decline in these portfolios during the first nine months of 2013 and an $8.7 billion decrease since the end of 2008, which has driven a significant improvement in our risk profile. Average loans during the first nine months of 2013 totaled $121.6 billion. See the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section of this MD&A for more information regarding average loan balances. While loan growth has improved since year end, demand remains modest overall. However, our commercial loan pipelines continue to increase and overall economic indicators in our markets are also improving.Commercial loans increased $2.5 billion, or 4%, during the first nine months of 2013. Growth was driven by C&I loans, encompassing a diverse array of large corporate and middle market borrowers, as well as CRE loans. C&I loans increased $1.9 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2012 driven by growth in our not-for-profit, government, and dealer portfolios. We also had growth in our large corporate lending areas, most notably in asset securitizations, energy, and asset-based lending. CRE loans increased $628 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2012 with the majority of the increase in the portfolio due to expanded relationships with clients in our footprint, growth in our institutional business, and success in our REIT platform.As the commercial real estate market has continued to strengthen over the past 18 months, we are rebuilding our CRE portfolio with loans to high quality clients. For risk diversification, we have strict limits and exposure caps both on specific projects and on borrowers. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. Residential loans remained relatively flat during the first nine months of 2013 as nonguaranteed residential mortgages increased $717 million, or 3%, which was offset by a $725 million, or 17%, decrease in government-guaranteed residential mortgages. Nonguaranteed residential mortgages increased due to loan originations primarily to borrowers with strong credit characteristics (e.g., average FICO scores above 760) and were secured by residential properties with LTVs that averaged below 80%. The decrease in government-guaranteed loans was the result of payments and payoffs primarily driven by refinance activity.Consumer loans increased $481 million, or 2%, during the first nine months of 2013, primarily driven by increases in government-guaranteed student loans of $132 million and other direct loans of $274 million. The increases were largely due to purchases of guaranteed student loans and new originations of other direct loans and installment loans.Loans Held for SaleDuring the first nine months of 2013, LHFS decreased $937 million compared to December 31, 2012 due to the decline in mortgage production as a result of the increased interest rate environment.        102Asset QualityOur asset quality continued to trend favorably during the first nine months of 2013, driven by continued improvement in asset quality metrics, resolution of existing NPAs, and lower inflows of NPLs. Further, positive trends in our residential portfolios have driven recent asset quality improvements as the improved economic conditions continue to drive lower residential delinquencies, lower loss severities, and higher prices upon disposition of foreclosed assets. This has resulted in reduced NPLs, lower early stage delinquencies, an improved risk profile, and movement in our loan portfolio towards longer-term balance sheet targets. During the first nine months of 2013, NPLs decreased $510 million, or 33%, largely the result of a decline in residential mortgage NPLs. Partially driving the decline was the reclassification of approximately $235 million of loans previously discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy to accruing TDR status during the period as they exhibited a six month period of payment performance since being discharged. Our NPLs have decreased significantly since their peak in 2009, down by $4.5 billion, or 81%. At September 30, 2013, the percentage of NPLs to total loans was 0.83%, down 44 basis points from December 31, 2012. We anticipate NPLs will continue to decline in the fourth quarter of 2013.Net charge-offs were $146 million and $551 million compared to $511 million and $1.3 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Net charge-offs decreased $365 million, or 71%, and $732 million, or 57%, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. Partially driving the decline in net charge-offs compared to 2012 was the $172 million of charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012 related to movement of nonperforming mortgage and CRE loans to LHFS in anticipation of sale of these loans. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, the net charge-off ratio fell to the lowest level in six years; 0.47% and 0.61%, respectively, compared to 1.64% and 1.39% during the same periods in 2012, respectively. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter. Total early stage delinquencies decreased to 0.65%, the lowest level since June 2006, and a decline of 28 basis points from December 31, 2012. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 0.35% of total loans at September 30, 2013, from 0.48% at December 31, 2012. At September 30, 2013, all commercial, residential, and consumer loan classes showed improvement in early stage delinquencies compared to December 31, 2012. We expect future early stage delinquency ratio improvements to be driven by residential loans, as they are still somewhat elevated by historical standards. The overall economy, particularly changes in unemployment, will influence additional improvement.Overall, we are pleased with our improved risk profile and positive trends of our asset quality. As we look forward, a recovering economy and strengthening housing market should continue to support our positive asset quality trends, with additional improvements influenced by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized credit quality levels.103ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses consists of both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience is shown in the table below. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10−K, and Note 5, "Allowance for Credit Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section within "Critical Accounting Policies" in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our ALLL accounting policy, determination, and allocation.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. 104Charge-offsNet charge-offs decreased by $365 million, or 71%, during the third quarter of 2013 compared with the same period in 2012, driven by general improvement in credit quality in 2013, and the $172 million of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012 related to the sale of nonperforming mortgage and CRE loans. For the first nine months of 2013, net charge-offs decreased by $732 million, or 57%, compared to the first nine months of 2012, driven by the same factors as noted for the quarterly comparison. The decline in net charge-offs was particularly notable in our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.47% during the third quarter of 2013, a reduction of 117 basis points from the same period in 2012 and at the lowest level in six years. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional policy information related to charge-offs. Provision for Credit LossesThe total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses, as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. During the third quarter of 2013, the provision for loan losses decreased $358 million, or 80%, compared to the third quarter of 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, the provision for loan losses decreased $617 million, or 58%, compared to the same period in 2012. The change in the provision for loan losses was largely attributable to improvements in credit quality trends and lower net charge-offs during the first nine months of 2013, partially due to the $172 million of net charge-offs and provision in the third quarter of 2012 related to nonperforming mortgage and CRE loan sales.

The appropriate ALLL level will continue to be determined by our detailed quarterly review process. We currently expect a small decrease in our ratio of ALLL to period-end loans as the impact of improving asset quality conditions are partially offset by anticipated loan growth. At September 30, 2013, the ALLL to period-end loans ratio of 1.67% decreased 13 basis points from 1.80% at December 31, 2012. When excluding government-guaranteed loans, the ALLL to period-end loans decreased to 1.80% at September 30, 2013, compared to 1.95% at December 31, 2012. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs was 201% at September 30, 2013, compared to 142% at December 31, 2012. The increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $510 million decrease in NPLs driven in part by 2012 NPL sales, partially offset by the reduction in ALLL.          105NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe following table presents our NPAs:     Table 10(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 % ChangeNonaccrual/NPLs     Commercial loans:     C&I$216 $194 11 %CRE42 66 (36)Commercial construction17 34 (50)Total commercial NPLs275 294 (6)Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed464 775 (40)Home equity products209 341 (39)Residential construction79 112 (29)Total residential NPLs752 1,228 (39)Consumer loans:     Other direct4 6 (33)Indirect6 19 (68)Total consumer NPLs10 25 (60)Total nonaccrual/NPLs1,037 1,547 (33)OREO1196 264 (26)Other repossessed assets9 9 —Nonperforming LHFS59 37 59Total NPAs$1,301 $1,857 (30)%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$1,163 $782 49 %Accruing LHFS past due 90 days or more— 1 (100)TDRs     Accruing restructured loans $2,744 $2,501 10 %Nonaccruing restructured loans2406 639 (36)Ratios     NPLs to total loans0.83% 1.27% (35)%Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO, other repossessed assets, and nonperforming LHFS1.04 1.52 (32)1 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $175 million and $140 million at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.2 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.NPAs decreased $556 million, or 30%, during first nine months of 2013. The decrease was primarily attributed to a $510 million, or 33%, decrease in NPLs. All loan classes declined except C&I, which increased $22 million, or 11%. Net charge-offs, foreclosures, and improved loan performance contributed to the decrease in NPLs. Specifically, the decrease in NPLs related primarily to reductions in residential mortgage NPLs of $311 million, or 40%, and home equity NPLs of $132 million, or 39%. The decrease in residential mortgage NPLs was primarily due to the return to accruing TDR status, of approximately $235 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans, which were current for at least six months following discharge by the bankruptcy court. At September 30, 2013, our ratio of NPLs to total loans was 0.83%, down from 1.27% at December 31, 2012 as a result of the decline in NPLs and the increase in total loans. We expect NPLs to continue to trend down in the fourth quarter as housing markets and asset quality improves and loans move through the foreclosure process. The performance of the residential real estate portfolios will be a prime influence on NPL balance trends.106Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall NPAs as a result of the devaluation of U.S. housing during the recent economic recession. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may continue to impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the NPA portfolio.Nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, and TDR loans, are problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses that are disclosed in the NPA table above. Loans with known potential credit problems that may not otherwise be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans, which are disclosed along with additional credit quality information in Note 4, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, there were no known significant potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed.Nonperforming LoansNonperforming commercial loans decreased $19 million, or 6%, during the first nine months of 2013 with reductions in CRE NPLs of $24 million, or 36%, and $17 million, or 50%, in commercial construction NPLs. Partially offsetting the decrease in nonperforming commercial loans was an increase in C&I NPLs of $22 million, or 11%, which was driven by a limited number of specific loans.Nonperforming residential loans were the largest driver of the overall decline in NPLs, decreasing $476 million, or 39%, during the first nine months of 2013. The reduction in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs and home equity NPLs accounted for $311 million and $132 million, respectively, of this decrease, primarily as a result of certain Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans returning to accruing status, in addition to foreclosures, net charge-offs, and improved loan performance. Additionally, residential construction NPLs decreased $33 million, primarily as a result of net charge-offs.Interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not generally recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero. We recognized $6 million and $8 million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans during third quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $27 million and $22 million for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $16 million and $37 million during third quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $58 million and $123 million for first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, would have been recognized.Other Nonperforming AssetsOREO decreased $68 million, or 26%, during the first nine months of 2013 as a result of net decreases of $50 million in residential construction related properties and $22 million in commercial properties, offset by an increase of $4 million in residential homes. During the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $269 million and $362 million, respectively, contributing to net gains on sales of OREO of $53 million and $18 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves. We do not expect to see the continuance of net gains on sale at the current level given the elevated level of gains on sales during 2013. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 13, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential and commercial properties comprised 63% and 23%, respectively, of OREO at September 30, 2013; the remainder is related to land and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value less estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in values could result in additional losses on these properties as we periodically revalue them as further discussed in Note 13, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, total accruing loans past due ninety days or more included LHFI and LHFS and totaled $1.2 billion and $783 million, respectively. Accruing LHFI past due ninety days or more increased by $381 million, or 49%, during the first nine months of 2013, primarily driven by guaranteed student loan delinquencies. Residential mortgages and student loans that are guaranteed by a federal agency comprised 95% and 92%, respectively, of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. As of the same dates, $55 million and $60 million, respectively, of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were not guaranteed.          107Restructured LoansTo maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform an in-depth and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extension of terms.Loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower financial difficulties are reported as TDRs. Accruing loans may retain accruing status at the time of restructure and the status is determined by, among other things, the nature of the restructure, the borrower's repayment history, and the borrower's repayment capacity. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a sustainable history of repayment performance, typically six months, in accordance with their modified terms are generally reclassified to accruing TDR status. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market at the time of the modification. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $352 million and $348 million, respectively. See Note 4, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.Representatives of the United States Attorneys' Office for the Western District of Virginia (USAO) and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (collectively the “Government”) have advised STM of the status of their ongoing investigation of STM's administration of HAMP. The Government's investigation focuses on whether, during 2009 and 2010, STM harmed borrowers and violated civil or criminal laws by making misrepresentations and failing to properly process applications for modifications of certain mortgages owned by the GSEs pursuant to the HAMP guidelines. The Government continues to advise STM that it has made no determinations about how it will proceed in this matter, and STM continues to cooperate with the investigation and believes that it has substantial defenses to the asserted allegations. See additional discussion in Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.108The following tables display our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status. Guaranteed loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled approximately $40 million and $24 million at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.Selected Residential TDR Data          Table 11 September 30, 2013 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$642 $80 $722 $25 $42 $67Term extension16 6 22 1 5 6Rate reduction and term extension1,492 134 1,626 23 142 165Other 2178 13 191 16 59 75Total$2,328 $233 $2,561 $65 $248 $313             December 31, 2012 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$470 $37 $507 $36 $45 $81Term extension16 4 20 3 7 10Rate reduction and term extension1,562 172 1,734 78 209 287Other 27 2 9 172 39 211Total$2,055 $215 $2,270 $289 $300 $5891 TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.2 Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.At September 30, 2013, our total TDR portfolio was $3.2 billion and was composed of $2.9 billion, or 91%, of residential loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $164 million, or 5%, of commercial loans (predominantly income-producing properties), and $112 million, or 4%, of consumer loans.Total TDRs increased $10 million from December 31, 2012. Accruing TDRs were up $243 million, or 10%, offset by a decrease in nonaccruing TDRs of $233 million, or 36%. The increase in accruing TDRs was primarily due to the return of approximately $235 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans to accruing TDR status from nonaccruing TDR.Generally, interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such recognized interest income was $31 million and $28 million during the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, and $87 million and $85 million for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $40 million and $38 million during the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, and $116 million and $115 million for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, would have been recognized.109SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUEThe following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Trading Assets and LiabilitiesTrading assets decreased $318 million, or 5%, since December 31, 2012, as a result of normal changes in the trading portfolio product mix, primarily due to decreases in derivatives, trading loans, and agency MBS, partially offset by increases in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities. Net derivatives recognized in trading assets decreased $434 million, offset by the impact of a $213 million decrease in cash collateral.Trading liabilities increased compared to December 31, 2012, due to increases in corporate and other debt securities and derivatives as a result of normal business activity. Net derivatives recognized in trading liabilities increased $47 million, including the impact of a $325 million decrease in cash collateral.See Note 11, "Derivative Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on derivatives.110Securities Available for Sale      Table 13 September 30, 2013(Dollars in millions)AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains UnrealizedLosses FairValueU.S. Treasury securities$792 $7 $28 $771Federal agency securities2,167 53 49 2,171U.S. states and political subdivisions239 8 2 245MBS - agency18,223 449 314 18,358MBS - private167 1 2 166ABS95 2 1 96Corporate and other debt securities40 3 — 43Other equity securities1775 1 — 776Total securities AFS$22,498 $524 $396 $22,6261At September 30, 2013, other equity securities included the following: $266 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $402 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, $107 million in mutual fund investments, and $1 million of other.

Securities Available for SaleThe securities AFS portfolio is managed as part of our overall ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio while managing our interest rate and liquidity risk profile. The increase of $0.7 billion at September 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, was primarily due to increased holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, government agency securities, and agency MBS,as a result of normal portfolio activity. During the nine months, our holdings in ABS, municipal securities, and private MBS were lower due to maturities and cash flow run-off.During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we recorded $2 million in net realized gains from the sale of securities AFS, compared to net realized gains of $2.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, including $1 million and $7 million in OTTI, respectively. The $2.0 billion in gains recorded during 2012 included $1.9 billion net securities gains from the sales of the Coke common stock as a result of the early termination of the Agreements. Compared to year end, the decrease in net unrealized gains at September 30, 2013 was driven by an increase in market interest rates primarily during the second quarter. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see Note 3, "Securities Available for Sale," and the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 13, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.For the third quarter of 2013, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 2.52%, compared with 2.78% for the third quarter of 2012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 2.53%, compared with 3.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities, reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower yields, and the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock on a year to date basis, drove the decline in yield on securities AFS. Our total investment securities 111portfolio had an effective duration of 4.1 years at September 30, 2013, compared to 2.2 years at December 31, 2012. The increase in the effective duration is the result of slower agency MBS prepayment assumptions associated with higher mortgage rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 4.1 years suggests an expected price change of 4.1% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.The credit quality and liquidity profile of the securities portfolio remained strong at September 30, 2013, and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends and our overall liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment portfolio could change meaningfully over time.BORROWINGS                               Short-Term Borrowings              Table 14 September 30, 2013 Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Balance Rate Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End(Dollars in millions) Balance Rate  Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$934 0.06% $505 0.09% $934 $625 0.10% $1,000Securities sold underagreements to repurchase 11,574 0.12 1,885 0.13 1,879 1,824 0.15 1,879FHLB advances2,450 0.25 3,282 0.25 3,950 2,972 0.26 3,950Other short-term borrowings 22,029 0.28 1,940 0.32 2,029 1,822 0.26 2,029                 September 30, 2012 Three Months Ended September 30, 2012 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012 Balance Rate Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End(Dollars in millions) Balance Rate  Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$680 0.09% $701 0.11% $821 $793 0.11% $908Securities sold underagreements to repurchase 11,630 0.18 1,461 0.18 1,630 1,580 0.17 1,781FHLB advances4,500 0.31 4,886 0.30 5,000 5,832 0.23 9,000Other short-term borrowings 22,011 0.33 1,778 0.31 2,011 1,757 0.34 2,0111 Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of the borrowings.2 Other short-term borrowings include master notes, dealer collateral, and other short-term borrowed funds.Short-Term BorrowingsOur period-end short-term borrowings decreased $1.8 billion, or 21%, from September 30, 2012, predominantly due to a $2.1 billion decrease in FHLB advances as a result of our decision to utilize a portion of loan sale proceeds during 2012 to reduce short-term borrowings. This decline was partially offset by an increase of $254 million in funds purchased during the same period. Daily average short-term borrowings decreased $1.2 billion, or 14%, compared to the third quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in daily average balances for FHLB advances of $1.6 billion and funds purchased of $196 million, partially offset by increases in daily average balances of $424 million and $104 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and dealer collateral, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our daily average short-term borrowings decreased $2.7 billion, or 27%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to a decrease in daily average balance for FHLB advances of $2.9 billion and a decline in the daily average balance for funds purchased of $168 million, offset by increases in daily average balances for securities sold under agreements to repurchase and dealer collateral of $244 million and $50 million, respectively. These changes were due to ordinary balance sheet management practices, as well as the payoff and maturity of certain FHLB advances during 2013 and the second half of 2012.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, our maximum monthly outstanding balances and daily average balances for FHLB advances were higher than our period-end balance as a result of normal borrowing fluctuations due to ordinary balance sheet management practices, as well as the aforementioned maturity of certain FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2013. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, our daily average balances for funds purchased were lower than our period-end balance as a result of increased borrowing towards the end of the third quarter of 2013. 112For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our maximum monthly outstanding balance for FHLB advances was higher than our period-end balance as a result of higher FHLB borrowings at certain points during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, due to ordinary balance sheet management practices and the aforementioned payoff and maturity of certain FHLB advances during the period.Long-Term Debt      During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our long-term debt increased $628 million. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $600 million of 10-year senior notes under our Global Bank Note program during the second quarter of 2013. The senior notes pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.75% and will mature on May 1, 2023. We may call the notes at par beginning on April 1, 2023. Additionally, in October 2013, we issued $750 million of 5-year senior notes that pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.35% and will mature on November 1, 2018. We may call the notes beginning on October 1, 2018. There have been no other material changes in our long-term debt, as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, since December 31, 2012. CAPITAL RESOURCESOur primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Additionally, mark-to-market adjustments related to our estimated credit spreads for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital.Both the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average total assets less certain deductions, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.The concept of Tier 1 common equity, the portion of Tier 1 capital that is considered common equity, was first introduced in the 2009 SCAP. Our primary regulator, rather than U.S. GAAP, defines Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio. As a result, our calculation of these measures may differ from those of other financial services companies who calculate them. However, Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio continue to be important factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions; therefore, we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital.On October 11, 2013 the Federal Reserve published final rules in the Federal Register related to required minimum capital ratios that become effective for us on January 1, 2015. See further discussion below under "Basel III."Effective January 1, 2013, the new Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk Rule (the "Market Risk Rule") promulgated by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators became effective. The application of the Market Risk Rule required changes to the computation of RWA associated with assets held in our trading account and expanded the calculation to include a stressed VAR measure among other things. See the "Market Risk from Trading Activities" section of this MD&A for additional discussion.Regulatory Capital Ratios  Table 15  (Dollars in millions)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 capital$15,736 $14,975Total capital18,707 18,131RWA143,486 134,524Average total assets for leverage ratio166,330 168,053Tier 1 common equity:   Tier 1 capital$15,736 $14,975Less:   Qualifying trust preferred securities627 627Preferred stock725 725Allowable minority interest116 114Tier 1 common equity$14,268 $13,509Risk-based ratios:   Tier 1 common equity19.94% 10.04%Tier 1 capital10.97 11.13Total capital13.04 13.48Tier 1 leverage ratio9.46 8.91Total shareholders’ equity to assets12.27 12.101 At September 30, 2013 our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio as calculated under the final Basel III capital rules was estimated to be 9.7%. See the "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" section in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the estimated Basel III ratio.At September 30, 2013, our capital ratios are well above current regulatory requirements. The decline in our capital ratios from December 31, 2012 was due to an increase in our RWA primarily as a result of loan growth, the aforementioned change in the Market Risk Rule, as well as, a refinement in the risk weighting, during the third quarter of 2013, for certain unused lending commitments that provide clients' access to standby letters of credit. The treatment of these particular unused lending commitments is not applicable under the Basel III capital calculation rules and, as a result, had no impact on our current quarter estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $134 million, or $0.25 per common share, compared with $81 million, or $0.15 per common share during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Additionally, we declared and paid preferred dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 of $28 million and $8 million, respectively. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, retained earnings of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations totaled approximately $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.During the first quarter of 2013, we submitted our capital plan for review by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR process. Upon completion of the Federal Reserve's review, they did not object to our planned capital actions. As such, we maintained dividend payments on our preferred stock during the first nine months of 2013, increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 in the second quarter and maintained that rate through the third quarter of 2013, and repurchased a total of $100 million, or approximately 3.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock, during the second and third quarters of 2013. Pursuant to our capital plan, we plan to repurchase an additional $100 million of our outstanding common stock by the end of the first quarter of 2014. Basel IIIThe Dodd−Frank Act will impact the composition of our capital elements in at least two ways over the next several years. First, the Dodd−Frank Act authorizes the Federal Reserve to enact “prudential” capital requirements which require greater capital levels than presently required and which vary among financial institutions based on size, risk, complexity, and other factors. As expected, the Federal Reserve used this authority in its new capital rules published on October 11, 2013, seeking to implement the Basel III capital requirements. Second, a portion of the Dodd−Frank Act, sometimes referred to as the Collins Amendment, directs the Federal Reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies, including us, which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depositary institutions, such as SunTrust Bank. 113On October 11, 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules addressing implementation of the Basel III capital requirements, which require banking organizations such as SunTrust to begin compliance on January 1, 2015 with the revised minimum regulatory capital ratios and begin the transition period for the revised definitions of regulatory capital and the revised regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, as well as begin compliance with the standardized approach for determining RWA. Additional rules, known as the Advanced Approaches rules, require additional measurement of RWA as well as separate calculation of qualifying capital instruments. The Advanced Approaches rules generally apply to banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, or that have total on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more. Furthermore, beginning January 1, 2016, these banking organizations are required to begin the transition period for capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers, which places restrictions on the amount of retained earnings that may be used for distributions or discretionary bonus payments. Accordingly, SunTrust is not currently required to comply with these separate requirements. Under the final rules, the minimum capital requirements remain unchanged from the rules proposed by the Federal Reserve in 2012, with thresholds for Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%; Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6%; Total Capital ratio of 8%; and U.S. Leverage ratio of 4%. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWA also remains applicable. As of September 30, 2013, we believe each of our regulatory capital ratios exceeds their respective "adequately capitalized" minimums under the final rules, as well as the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, when measured on a fully-phased-in basis.Furthermore, the final Basel III capital rules require the phase out of non-qualifying Tier 1 Capital instruments such as trust preferred securities. As such, over a 2-year period beginning on January 1, 2015, approximately $627 million in principal amount of Parent Company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities currently outstanding will no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment, but instead will qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment. Accordingly, we anticipate that, by January 1, 2016, all $627 million of our outstanding trust preferred securities will lose Tier 1 capital treatment, and will be reclassified as Tier 2 capital. We anticipate the impact of this to result in an approximately 40 basis point reduction in our Tier 1 capital ratio. We do not expect any impact to our total capital ratio as a result of the transition to Tier 2 capital.DFAST Stress TestingAs a component of our overall stress testing process, and as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, SunTrust and certain other banks are required to conduct semi-annual stress tests pursuant to the DFAST Final Rule. During the third quarter of 2013, we disclosed the results of our semi-annual DFAST process for 2013, which was submitted to the Federal Reserve in July 2013. The results of our semi-annual DFAST process indicate that we will have the financial resources at our disposal to successfully navigate a hypothetical severe and protracted economic downturn and will maintain capital levels that exceed regulatory minimums throughout the course of the hypothetical scenario. The detailed results of our semi-annual DFAST process are available on our website at www.suntrust.com.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThere have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTThere have been no significant changes to our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our credit risk management practices as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Operational Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.114Market Risk ManagementMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of our balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately 55% of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, are approximately 42% of total loans. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk.Market Risk from Non-Trading ActivitiesThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No limit breaches occurred during the first nine months of 2013.The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, which, as described in additional detail below, are employed by management to understand net interest income at risk and MVE at risk. These measures show that our interest rate risk profile is slightly asset sensitive at September 30, 2013. MVE and net interest income sensitivity are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together. Net interest income sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and is considered a shorter term measure, while MVE sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments' respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure. A positive net interest income sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year, asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to balance sheet composition. A negative MVE sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that value of the financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities. One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon, which differs from the interest rate sensitivities in Table 16 which are prescribed to be over a one year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.As the future path of interest rates cannot be known, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to instantaneous moves in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed.    Table 16     Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months1(Basis points)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Rate Change   +2001.7% 4.8%+1001.0% 2.5% -25(0.8)% (0.8)%1Estimated % change of net interest income is reflected on a non-FTE basis.115The decrease in asset sensitivity from December 31, 2012 is predominantly due to slower assumed prepayments on mortgage-related products due to higher long-term rates and balance sheet mix changes. Net interest income increases due to higher rates are less than those estimated at December 31, 2012, due to a decline in floating rate assets relative to liabilities which would reprice to higher yields over the next year if rates did in fact increase.We also perform valuation analysis, which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. However, MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. At September 30, 2013, the MVE profile indicates a decline in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. Market Value of Equity Sensitivity  Table 17     Estimated % Change in MVE(Basis points)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Rate Change   +200(6.2)% (2.4)%+100(2.7)% (0.1)% -250.4% (0.3)%The increase in MVE sensitivity from December 31, 2012 is primarily due to a slight increase in asset durations due to higher long-term interest rates. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.Market Risk from Trading ActivitiesUnder established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading activities using a VAR approach that takes into account exposures resulting from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, credit spread risk, and commodity risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio against established limits. For risk management purposes, our VAR calculation measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. This means that, on average, trading losses are expected to exceed VAR one out of 100 trading days or two to three times per year. While VAR can be a useful risk management tool, it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance. As such, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk. Other tools used to actively manage trading risk include scenario analysis, stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits. In addition to VAR, in accordance with the new Market Risk Rule, which was effective January 1, 2013, we also calculate Stressed VAR, which is used as a component of the total market risk-based capital charge. We calculate the Stressed VAR risk measure using a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employ a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window that reflects a period of significant financial stress to our portfolio.116The following table presents VAR, Stressed VAR, and net trading assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, as well as VAR by Risk Factor at September 30, 2013:Value at Risk Profile      Table 18         Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2013 2012VAR (1-day holding period)       Ending$3 $4 $3 $4High5 4 8 5Low3 3 3 3Average5 4 5 4        Stressed VAR (10-day holding period) 1       Ending$30 N/A $30 N/AHigh33 N/A 92 N/ALow18 N/A 12 N/AAverage24 N/A 28 N/A        Net Trading Assets (Dollars in billions)       Ending balance$4.5 $4.9 $4.5 $4.9Average balance4.6 4.6 4.8 4.6        (Dollars in millions)September 30, 2013       VAR by Risk Factor (1-day holding period) 1      Commodity price risk$—     Equity price risk3     Foreign exchange risk—     Interest rate risk1     Credit spread risk3     VAR (1-day diversified) total3     1 "N/A" - The calculation of Stressed VAR and VAR by Risk Factor under the new Market Risk Rule was not applicable in prior periods.The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VAR, is predominantly comprised of four material sub-portfolios of covered positions: Equity Derivatives, Fixed Income Securities, Interest Rate Derivatives, and Credit Trading. There were no material changes in composition of the trading portfolio during the first nine months of 2013. While VAR and Stressed VAR were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2013, driven by increased volume in our equity derivatives business, exposure to equity price risk factors were subsequently reduced resulting in a lower risk profile at September 30, 2013. The trading portfolio did not contain any correlation trading positions or on or off balance sheet securitization positions during the first nine months of 2013.Effective January 1, 2013, a change to our VAR methodology was implemented and we began using historical based simulation instead of the previously used Monte Carlo simulation. At the time of methodology change implementation, our VAR calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation yielded results that were similar to the historical simulation presented. The methodology change was primarily to ensure our internal modeling approach for VAR was on the same basis as that for Stressed VAR, which is a requirement under the Market Risk Rule.117In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, we evaluate the accuracy of our VAR model through daily backtesting by comparing daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with the corresponding daily VAR-based measures. As illustrated below, for the first nine months of 2013, there were no instances where trading losses exceeded firmwide VAR.We have valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for all covered positions. Additionally, reporting of trading positions is in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to independent price verification. See Note 11, "Derivative Financial Instruments" and Note 13, "Fair Value Election and Measurement" in this Form 10-Q and "Critical Accounting Policies" in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies.Model risk management: Our model risk management approach for validating and evaluating the accuracy of internal and vended models and associated processes includes developmental and implementation testing and on-going monitoring and maintenance performed by the various model owners. Our MRMG regularly performs independent model validations for the VAR and stressed VAR models. The validations include evaluation of all model-owner authored documentation and model-owner developed monitoring and maintenance plans and reports. In addition, the MRMG performs its own testing. Due to ongoing developments in financial markets, evolution in modeling approaches, and for purposes of model enhancement, we assess all VAR models regularly through the monitoring and maintenance process.Stress testing: We use a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VAR reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of rare and extreme historical but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. In addition to performing firmwide stress testing of our aggregate trading portfolio, additional types of secondary stress tests including historical repeats and simulations using hypothetical risk factor shocks are also performed. Across our comprehensive stress testing framework, all trading positions across each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and commodity risk) are included. We review stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and make updates as necessary to ensure that both current and potential emerging risks are appropriately captured.Trading portfolio capital adequacy:  We assess capital adequacy on a regular basis, based on estimates of our risk profile and capital positions under baseline and stressed scenarios. Scenarios consider material risks, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Our assessment of capital adequacy arising from market risk also includes a review of risk arising from material portfolios of covered positions. See “Capital Resources” in this MD&A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 118Liquidity Risk ManagementLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable, at a reasonable cost, to meet financial obligations as they come due. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund projected and potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments.The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities (unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets) in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a store of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. At September 30, 2013, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $11.4 billion of unencumbered and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately 95% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that it could quickly convert to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital service) for an extended period of months in accordance with our risk limits.We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual adverse events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding scenarios and plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingency liquidity. These sources of contingency liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; the capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The following table presents period end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. We believe these contingency liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs measured in our contingency funding scenarios.Contingency Liquidity Sources   Table 19 September 30, 2013 September 30, 2012(Dollars in billions)As of  Average for theNine Months Ended ¹  As of  Average for theNine Months Ended ¹ Excess reserves$— $1.2 $1.8 $1.8Free and liquid investment portfolio securities11.4 12.0 11.4 13.5FHLB borrowing capacity13.2 13.3 12.1 11.3Discount Window borrowing capacity19.9 19.1 17.7 17.0Total$44.5 $45.6 $43.0 $43.61Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.Uses of Funds.  Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. At September 30, 2013, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in its Federal Reserve account. The Parent Company also retains a material cash position, in accordance with our policies and risk limits, discussed in greater detail below.119Contingent uses of funds may arise from a variety of adverse events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. At September 30, 2013, S&P maintained a "Positive" outlook while Moody’s and DBRS maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings. On October 8, 2013, Fitch upgraded its outlook on our credit ratings from "Stable" to "Positive," citing our improving overall risk profile and asset quality, solid liquidity profile, and sound capital position. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the "Positive" and “Stable” credit rating outlooks.

Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits originated primarily from our retail branch network are our largest and most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits decreased to $126.9 billion at September 30, 2013, from $130.2 billion at December 31, 2012, driven primarily by seasonal factors. The expiration of the FDIC's temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts on December 31, 2012 had an immaterial impact on our deposit balances.We also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding increased modestly to $16.4 billion at September 30, 2013 from $15.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits, as well as Fed funds purchased, increased modestly from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2012 to $4.9 billion at September 30, 2013.As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of such securities, of which approximately $4.4 billion of issuance capacity remained available at September 30, 2013. During the first nine months of 2013, we issued several small structured notes for the Parent Company in the aggregate amount of $139 million. The Bank maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. In April 2013, the Bank issued $600 million of 10-year senior notes that will pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.75%. We may call the notes at par beginning on April 1, 2023, one month prior to the notes' stated maturity date. At September 30, 2013, the Bank retained $37.0 billion of remaining capacity to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these Bank and Parent Company programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, which is formal program capacity and not a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities depends upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Therefore, our ability to access these markets in the future could be impaired for either systemic or idiosyncratic reasons. As mentioned above, we maintain contingency funding scenarios to anticipate and manage the likely impact of impaired capital markets access and other adverse liquidity circumstances.120Parent Company Liquidity.  Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its cash resources. We measure and manage this metric, "Months to Required Funding," using forecasts of both normal and adverse conditions. Under adverse conditions, we measure how long the Parent Company can meet its capital and debt service obligations after experiencing material attrition of short-term, unsecured funding and without the support of dividends from the Bank or access to the capital markets. At September 30, 2013, the Parent's Months to Required Funding remained well in excess of current ALCO and Board limits. Our Board Risk Committee regularly reviews this and other liquidity risk metrics. In accordance with these risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its net maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. There is no material Parent Company debt scheduled to mature in 2013 or 2014. A majority of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, loans to our subsidiaries, and common share repurchases. We may repurchase common stock subject to an annual capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in the CCAR process. Since the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan submitted in January 2013, during the first quarter we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock between the second quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014. Pursuant to that plan, we repurchased a combined $100 million of our outstanding common stock during the second and third quarters. We used existing cash balances at the Parent Company to fund these repurchases. See further details of the authorized common share repurchases in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A and in Part II, "Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
