Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and include risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and 77monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even from inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.INTRODUCTIONThis MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated).We are one of the nation’s largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under three business segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See Note 14, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the change in our segment reporting structure since December 31, 2011. In addition to deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, capital market services, and credit-related insurance.The following analysis of our financial performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements, and other information contained in this document and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements and related information to conform them to the September 30, 2012, presentation. In the MD&A, net interest income, the net interest margin, and the efficiency ratio are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as, to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided in Table 1, Selected Quarterly Financial Data.78EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWEconomic and regulatoryEconomic indicators were mixed during the first nine months of 2012 after remaining relatively unchanged during 2011. Unemployment declined from year-end levels, while consumer confidence and the housing markets remained unsettled. The unemployment rate, which fell below 9% during the fourth quarter of 2011, continued to decline modestly during the first nine months of 2012, settling at just below 8% at September 30, 2012. Consumer confidence improved during 2012, as consumer spending increased amidst improving labor market conditions and subdued consumer price inflation, but remained depressed overall when compared to pre-recession levels as a result of a continued sluggish economic recovery in the U.S., continued concerns over the health of the European Union, and reports of slowing growth in other emerging economies. While some actions have been taken during 2012 to ease the European sovereign debt crisis, uncertainty in the direction of the financial markets continues to exist as European consumer confidence continued to decline. As of September 30, 2012, we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of European countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. See additional discussion of European debt exposure in "Other Market Risk" in this MD&A. The U.S. housing market continued to be weak as evidenced by the large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties and continued low levels of construction of new single-family homes. Further, while home prices have risen modestly during the first nine months of 2012, prices remained under pressure and many continued to owe more on their mortgage compared to the current market value of their home. Adding to the economic uncertainty is the risk of the U.S. economy experiencing the "fiscal cliff" at the end of 2012, and the negative effects that may result from higher taxes and reductions in government spending. Amidst the continued stagnant economic conditions seen during the first nine months of 2012, the Federal Reserve indicated in September that highly accommodative monetary policy will remain for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens and as such, it anticipates maintaining key interest rates at exceptionally low levels, at least through mid-2015. As a result of employing their monetary policy, the Federal Reserve continues to maintain large portfolios of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and agency MBS and will continue to do so through the end of 2012. Further, in September the Federal Reserve indicated that if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, further action will be taken in the form of continued purchases of agency MBS, purchases of additional assets, and employment of other tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved. The Federal Reserve outlook remains for moderate economic growth over coming quarters, a relatively high unemployment rate, and the expectation of stable longer-term inflation. A persistent low interest rate environment may adversely affect the interest income we earn on loans and investments. Regulatory and financial reform efforts continued during the first nine months of 2012, as regulatory agencies proposed and worked to finalize numerous rules. In June 2012, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators issued a NPR related to capital adequacy rules to implement the BCBS's Basel III framework for financial institutions in the U.S. While much of the NPR was consistent with the BCBS's Basel III framework which it updated in June of 2011, we have noted some substantial differences from that original framework. As currently proposed, we believe that our risk-weighted assets will increase primarily due to increased risk-weightings for residential mortgages, home equity loans, and commercial real estate, resulting in a decline in our capital ratios. Under the proposed rules, we estimate our current Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 8.0%, which would be in compliance with the proposed requirements. The agencies are expected to consider the feedback and draft a final rule, which could take several quarters to complete. Accordingly, the final rule may differ from the current NPR. Further, the NPR indicates a phase-in for the new capital rules with the proposed risk-weightings requirement not becoming effective until 2015. Notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the timing and content of the final rule, our current Basel III Tier 1 common ratio estimate that we calculated using the NPR assumptions does not include the effect of any mitigating actions we may undertake to offset some of the anticipated impact of the proposed capital changes. See additional discussion in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A.In 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation's largest mortgage loan servicers, including us. Following this review, we and other servicers entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and "Nonperforming Assets" in this MD&A. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes and to retain an independent foreclosure consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. Our work required to comply with the Federal Reserve’s Consent Order continues. We note that certain aspects of the scope of the foreclosure review have not been finalized. On June 21, 2012, the OCC and the Federal Reserve released guidance that will be used in determining the compensation or other remedy that borrowers will receive for financial injury identified during the independent foreclosure review. Under the guidance, remediation for injuries may include lump-sum payments, suspension or rescission of a foreclosure, a loan modification or other loss mitigation assistance, correction of credit reports, or correction of deficiency amounts and records. For each instance requiring financial remediation, lump-sum payments can range from $500 to, in the most egregious cases, $125,000 plus an amount equal to the equity in the house. We are currently incurring the costs associated with the Consent Order-required foreclosure file review. Until the independent 79foreclosure review has been finalized, the total costs associated with the review process are uncertain; however, costs may increase from current levels. We also continue with settlement discussions with the U.S. and States Attorneys General related to mortgage servicing claims as discussed in Note 13, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. We accrued for the anticipated cost of resolving these and other potential claims in our 2011 financial results.CapitalOur capital remained strong at September 30, 2012, as year to date earnings drove our Tier 1 common equity ratio to 9.82% compared to 9.22% at December 31, 2011. Our Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 10.57% and 12.95%, respectively, compared to 10.90% and 13.67%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The change in Tier 1 and total capital ratios from year end is primarily due to the redemption of trust preferred securities in June and July. Overall, our capital remains strong and well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards. See additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity Risk” sections of this MD&A.Financial performanceOur core performance continued to steadily improve during the first nine months of 2012 and marked a continuation of the momentum that we built during 2011. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 included improved net interest income and core mortgage-related income, as well as continued favorable trends in loans, deposits, capital, and credit quality. Additionally, we took strategic actions during the three months ended September 30, 2012 that improved our risk profile and strengthened our balance sheet. The strategic actions that were announced in September included the following:•The acceleration of the termination of agreements regarding shares owned in Coke and the sale and charitable contribution of Coke shares resulted in a net pre-tax securities gain of $1.9 billion. In addition, our donation of one million shares of Coke to the SunTrust Foundation increased noninterest expense by $38 million. •The mortgage repurchase provision of $371 million increased the mortgage repurchase reserve to a level that is expected to cover the estimated losses on loans sold to GSEs prior to 2009 and negatively affected noninterest income. •The sale of $0.5 billion of nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans increased charge-offs and the loan loss provision by $172 million.•The movement of $1.4 billion of delinquent and current student loans and $0.5 billion of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans to loans held for sale decreased noninterest income by $92 million.•Additionally, valuation losses related to the planned sale of $0.2 billion of affordable housing investments resulted in a $96 million increase in noninterest expense. •Collectively, these actions contributed $753 million to net income available to common shareholders, or $1.40 per average common share, in the third quarter. Including the effects of the strategic actions, net income available to common shareholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion, or $1.98 and $2.94 per average common diluted share, respectively. Comparatively, net income available to common shareholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, was $211 million and $424 million, or $0.39 and $0.81 per average common diluted share, respectively. Results in 2012 compared to 2011 were driven by the strategic actions, but beyond the strategic actions, earnings were also impacted positively during both 2012 periods by improvements in net interest income and core mortgage-related income. Additionally, for the nine month periods, the absence of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury since the first quarter of 2011 and a non-cash charge related to the accelerated accretion associated with repayment of the U.S. government's TARP investment in March 2011 also drove improvement in 2012 compared to 2011. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for credit losses increased 30% and decreased 10%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. Excluding the additional provision in the third quarter related to the strategic actions discussed above, the provision for credit losses decreased significantly. However, as credit quality continues to improve, the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods. Our PPG expense initiative made significant progress during the first nine months of 2012 and at September 30, 2012, we have surpassed the goal of realizing $300 million in annualized savings through this program a year ahead of schedule. While the PPG program is complete, we expect to continue our efforts to become a more efficient organization. Further, we are focused on revenue and expense initiatives that will help us to achieve our long-term efficiency ratio target of below 60%.Our asset quality metrics continued to improve in 2012, driven in part by the strategic actions taken in the third quarter specifically designed to improve our risk profile and also due to improved core credit quality trends. At September 30, 2012, the ALLL ratio remains elevated by historical standards at 1.84% of total loans, but has declined 17 basis points compared to December 31, 2011 due to decreases in the ALLL primarily as a result of improving core credit quality trends. Total NPLs continued the downward trend that began in 2010, with a decline of 40% from December 31, 2011, partially due to the sales 80in the third quarter as part of the strategic actions and the remainder as a result of reduced inflows into nonaccrual combined with our problem loan resolution efforts. Declines in NPLs were experienced in all categories, with the largest declines coming from the residential and commercial portfolios, driven by the sales during the third quarter. Partially offsetting the declines was the decision, driven by regulatory guidance, to move $81 million in performing second lien loans that were subordinate to nonaccrual first lien loans into NPL. Even if the sales from the strategic actions were excluded and despite the movement of the performing second liens into NPL, our NPLs declined 22% compared to year end. OREO declined 37% compared to the prior year end and was the result of continued disposition of properties once we had clear title, coupled with a moderation of inflows. Our restructured loan portfolio declined 14% compared to December 31, 2011, with decreases in both the nonaccruing and accruing loan populations. Further, the accruing restructured portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 95% current on principal and interest payments at September 30, 2012. Early stage delinquencies, a leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, declined during the first nine months of 2012, both in total and when excluding government-guaranteed loan delinquencies. This decline was a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce risk in the portfolio as evidenced by declines in certain higher-risk loans. Our nonperforming loans are also down by almost 70% since their peak in 2009, to $1.7 billion, or 1.42% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, but increased by 29% during the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period a year earlier. The decrease was due to improvement in credit quality, while the increase was driven by the additional provision related to the strategic actions taken in September. Excluding this additional provision, the provision for loan losses declined during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter as a result of improvement in credit quality. Similarly, net charge-offs increased 4% during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and decreased 18% during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, respectively. Net charge-offs increased during the three month period as a result of the strategic actions in September and decreased in the nine months as a result of improved credit quality. Additionally, the increase in net charge-offs during the three month period was also due to the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental charge-offs related to our second lien policy change during the third quarter when we implemented a change in credit policy to recognize the charge-off at 120 days past due compared to previously recognizing the charge-off at 180 days past due. We currently expect an increase in net charge-offs during the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of some normal seasonality, and the fact that our recoveries were higher this quarter compared to recent quarters. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Nonperforming Assets,” and “Restructured Loans,” sections of this MD&A.Average loans increased 7% during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. The increase in both periods was led by increases in commercial and industrial loans, nonguaranteed mortgage, and consumer indirect loans. Additionally, during the nine month period guaranteed mortgage loans and the acquisition of student loan portfolios late in 2011 also drove the increase over the same period in the prior year. Partially offsetting the increase during the three month period were intentional decreases in guaranteed mortgage loans and home equity loans. During the nine month period, commercial real estate, commercial construction, and home equity loans were managed down, partially offsetting the increase in average loans. Our risk profile remains noticeably improved as declines in certain higher-risk loan portfolios have been offset by targeted growth in certain lower-risk portfolios, such as government-guaranteed loans. As a result, our guaranteed loans represent 9% of the portfolio at September 30, 2012 and 11% at December 31, 2011. Our decision to grow government guaranteed loans over the past several years served as a transition to a time of organic loan growth, as well as helped to reduce the risk in the balance sheet in conjunction with the decline in high-risk loans. As recent quarters have yielded organic growth, the higher-risk loan balances have declined, and as part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, we elected to sell approximately $500 million of government guaranteed mortgages in the second quarter of 2012. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2012, we transferred $500 million of nonperforming mortgages and commercial real estate loans, as well as $1.4 billion of delinquent and current government guaranteed student loans and $0.5 billion of delinquent government guaranteed mortgage loans to held for sale. As of September 30, 2012, we have sold a majority of the transferred nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans, while the guaranteed student and mortgage loans remained in held for sale at September 30. In October 2012, we sold over $1.0 billion of the student loans and we expect to sell the remaining transferred student, mortgage, and commercial real estate loans before year end. These transfers reduced the size of our government guaranteed portfolio at September 30, making the guaranteed portion of the portfolio more consistent with our longer-term balance sheet targets. Further, we expect to transfer approximately $600 million of additional guaranteed student loans to held for sale in the fourth quarter, with an immaterial gain or loss associated with the transfer, in furtherance of this long-term strategy. We remain committed to providing home financing in the communities we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers during this uncertain economic period. To that end, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we extended approximately $66 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients.Deposits remained at record highs during 2012 and the shift in deposit mix seen during 2011 to lower-cost deposits continued. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 2% and 3% during three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, respectively. The driver of the increase for both periods was average balance increases 81of 19% and 22%, respectively, in noninterest-bearing DDAs, partially offset by declines in higher cost time deposits of 17% and 14%, respectively, due to maturities of CDs. While a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is likely attributable to clients’ desires for having increased liquidity, we continue to believe that we have also proactively generated this growth in both our Consumer and Wholesale businesses as we have expanded our number of primary client relationships. Due to the growth seen in core deposits, our liquidity has been enhanced, enabling us to reduce our higher-cost wholesale funding sources. Our primary higher-cost funding source is long-term debt, which we reduced, on average, by 14% and 11% compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. A driver of the decline in long-term debt was the July 2012 redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities. Notwithstanding, we believe our deposit levels may decline modestly during 2013 after the removal of the FDIC's unlimited guarantee on demand deposits, which is expected to revert back to an insurance cap of $250,000 on January 1, 2013. See additional discussions in the "Net Interest Margin" and "Borrowings" sections of this MD&A.Total revenue, on an FTE basis, increased 75% and 27% compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, driven by securities gains realized on the sale of our Coke common stock and, to a lesser extent, a modest increase in net interest income. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, increased 1% and 2% compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, primarily as a result of higher loan balances, lower interest bearing liability balances and funding costs, and an improved funding mix. Our net interest margin was 3.38% and 3.42% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to 3.49% and 3.52% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. The declines in margin were a result of lower yielding loans, a decline in securities AFS yields, the elimination of the quarterly Coke dividend due to sale and contribution of our Coke stock, and a decline in our swap-related income related to maturing commercial loan swaps, but were partially offset by the redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities, the maturity of higher cost CDs, and the continued favorable shift in deposit mix to lower cost accounts. Noninterest income increased 182% and 62% compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, most notably due to the gains realized on the sale of our Coke common stock. Additionally, an improvement in core mortgage-related income was driven by the low interest rate environment and expanded refinancing programs announced by the U.S. government, which resulted in increased production volume during both periods. The increases in noninterest income were partially offset in both periods by an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision and, to a lesser extent, declines in card fees and other income. The mortgage repurchase provision increased $254 million and $414 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011, respectively, as a result of information received during the quarter from the GSEs, as well as our recent experience related to demands, that enhanced our ability to estimate losses of remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent loans sold to the GSEs prior to 2009. Card fees were lower in 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to the new regulations on debit card interchange fees that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011, and other income was driven lower by $92 million in losses related to the transfer of guaranteed student and mortgage loans to held for sale during the third quarter of 2012. Noninterest expense increased 11% and 5% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, primarily as a result of higher personnel costs, increased customer development expenses as a result of donating 1 million shares of our Coke common stock to the SunTrust Foundation, and a $96 million increase in other noninterest expense as a result of valuation losses on the planned sale of affordable housing investments. The increase in personnel costs was due to accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with organizational changes in certain businesses and higher incentive compensation due to improved business performance. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, outside processing and software expense and operating losses also contributed to the increase compared to the same period in 2011. Lower regulatory fees partially offset the increases in noninterest expense during the three and nine months. See additional discussion of our financial performance in the “Consolidated Financial Results” section of this MD&A. Line of Business HighlightsDuring 2012, we changed our reporting segments and now measure business activities based on three segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, our core performance improved in each line of business compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we had solid consumer loan production growth, with year-to-date volume 15% higher than the same nine month period in 2011. Favorable deposit trends also continued, as we generated DDA growth of 14% during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. While from a revenue perspective, this business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds, we have reduced expenses by 3% during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. Clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels, which has enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness.  82Wholesale Banking continued to deliver strong results with net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, nearly double what it was compared to the same period in 2011. Significant growth in capital markets fees, coupled with higher net interest income, drove revenue higher by 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011. Additionally, during the same period, average loans increased 8% and client deposits increased 5%. Furthermore, our CIB business surpassed record revenue and net income levels achieved earlier in 2012, setting another quarter of record performance for the three months ended September 30, 2012. While Mortgage Banking reported a net loss, primarily due to the increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve and the mortgage NPL and government guaranteed loan sales, core trends continued to markedly improve. Mortgage production volume was $24 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, up nearly $8 billion, or 48%, from the same period last year. This increase in volume has led to improved core mortgage origination income, which was $460 million higher during the same period, more than a 130% increase from the nine months ended September 30, 2011. It is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression going forward, but we do expect overall conditions in the mortgage market to continue to remain favorable in the near term. While the elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly been beneficial during 2012, we are also continuing to devote resources to purchase activity, which we think will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when refinance volume moderates. Additionally, we are also focused on building out delivery channels and driving volume with better channel selection to maximize our longer-term return profile for the Mortgage Banking segment. Our Corporate Other segment encompasses all remaining areas of the Company and remains key to our asset and liability performance. This segment continues to manage the balance sheet within the context of changing financial market conditions. This segment's net income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, driven by the securities gains on the sale of the Coke common stock, partially offset by a decline in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expenses.Additional discussion of our segment structure and changes made during 2012 can be found in Note 14, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and further discussion of segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, can be found in the "Business Segment Results" section of this MD&A.83SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA      Table 1 Three Months EndedSeptember 30 Nine Months EndedSeptember 30(Dollars in millions, except per share data)2012 2011 2012 2011Summary of Operations       Interest income$1,445 $1,538 $4,471 $4,638Interest expense174 275 615 867Net interest income1,271 1,263 3,856 3,771Provision for credit losses450 347 1,067 1,186Net interest income after provision for credit losses821 916 2,789 2,585Noninterest income2,542 903 4,358 2,698Noninterest expense1,726 1,560 4,813 4,567Net income before provision for income taxes1,637 259 2,334 716Provision for income taxes551 45 710 136Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest9 (1) 22 7Net income$1,077 $215 $1,602 $573Net income available to common shareholders$1,066 $211 $1,581 $424        Net interest income -

We believe noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.2We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.3Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.4We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.6We present a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.7Primarily relates to the impacts of unrealized securities AFS gains and accrued pension liabilities recognized in AOCI.8The proposed Basel III calculations of Tier 1 common equity, risk-weighted assets, and the Tier 1 common equity ratio are based upon our interpretation of the notice of proposed rule making issued by the Federal Reserve in June 2012. The final Basel III ruling by the Federal Reserve is subject to potential changes from the proposed rulemaking, as is our interpretation of the rules.9The largest differences between the risk-weighted assets as calculated under Basel I and the Basel III proposal relate to the risk-weightings for mortgage, home equity, and commercial real estate loans.86Consolidated Daily Average Balances, Income/Expense and Average Yields Earned and Rates PaidTable 2   Three Months Ended Increase/(Decrease) From Prior Year Quarter  September 30, 2012 September 30, 2011 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable-equivalent basis) AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Yields/RatesAssets                Loans:1                Commercial and industrial - FTE 2 $51,923 $578 4.43% $46,261 $595 5.11% $5,662 (0.68)Commercial real estate 4,525 41 3.56 5,192 49 3.72 (667) (0.16)Commercial construction 784 7 3.74 1,043 10 3.90 (259) (0.16)Residential mortgages - guaranteed 5,432 37 2.76 4,349 39 3.59 1,083 (0.83)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed 22,905 256 4.47 21,888 266 4.87 1,017 (0.40)Home equity products 14,866 138 3.68 15,718 148 3.74 (852) (0.06)Residential construction 667 9 5.44 826 11 5.10 (159) 0.34Guaranteed student loans 7,183 71 3.92 4,765 52 4.35 2,418 (0.43)Other direct 2,266 25 4.35 1,906 23 4.67 360 (0.32)Indirect 10,584 102 3.84 9,761 109 4.44 823 (0.60)Credit cards 577 14 9.87 522 15 11.31 55 (1.44)Nonaccrual3 2,368 8 1.37 3,407 7 0.79 (1,039) 0.58Total loans 124,080 1,286 4.12 115,638 1,324 4.54 8,442 (0.42)Securities available for sale:                Taxable 20,424 140 2.74 23,768 195 3.29 (3,344) (0.55)Tax-exempt - FTE2 350 5 5.29 485 7 5.44 (135) (0.15)Total securities available for sale - FTE 20,774 145 2.78 24,253 202 3.33 (3,479) (0.55)Securities purchased under agreements to resell 952 — 0.05 977 — — (25) 0.05LHFS 3,294 29 3.48 2,032 21 4.11 1,262 (0.63)Interest-bearing deposits 21 — 0.26 21 — 0.15 — 0.11Interest earning trading assets 4,086 15 1.49 3,915 21 2.09 171 (0.60)Total earning assets 153,207 1,475 3.83 146,836 1,568 4.23 6,371 (0.40)ALLL (2,193)     (2,682)     489  Cash and due from banks 4,579     5,567     (988)  Other assets 14,810     16,676     (1,866)  Noninterest earning trading assets 2,172     2,897     (725)  Unrealized gains on securities available for sale 2,707     2,782     (75)  Total assets $175,282     $172,076     $3,206  Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity                Interest-bearing deposits:                NOW accounts $24,810 $6 0.09% $23,979 $8 0.13% $831 (0.04)Money market accounts 41,517 21 0.20 43,095 39 0.36 (1,578) (0.16)Savings 5,190 1 0.09 4,622 2 0.15 568 (0.06)Consumer time 10,202 32 1.26 12,404 49 1.59 (2,202) (0.33)Other time 5,771 21 1.42 6,940 30 1.70 (1,169) (0.28)Total interest-bearing consumer and commercial deposits 87,490 81 0.37 91,040 128 0.56 (3,550) (0.19)Brokered time deposits 2,189 17 3.03 2,303 26 4.34 (114) (1.31)Foreign deposits 48 — 0.17 9 — 0.13 39 0.04Total interest-bearing deposits 89,727 98 0.43 93,352 154 0.65 (3,625) (0.22)Funds purchased 701 — 0.11 1,069 — 0.11 (368) —Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 1,461 1 0.18 2,170 1 0.15 (709) 0.03Interest-bearing trading liabilities 702 4 2.62 878 7 2.95 (176) (0.33)Other short-term borrowings 6,664 5 0.30 3,063 3 0.40 3,601 (0.10)Long-term debt 11,734 66 2.23 13,667 110 3.19 (1,933) (0.96)Total interest-bearing liabilities 110,989 174 0.62 114,199 275 0.95 (3,210) (0.33)Noninterest-bearing deposits 37,863     31,934     5,929  Other liabilities 4,832     4,069     763  Noninterest-bearing trading liabilities 979     1,874     (895)  Shareholders’ equity 20,619     20,000     619  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $175,282     $172,076     $3,206  Interest Rate Spread     3.21%     3.28%   (0.07)Net Interest Income - FTE4   $1,301     $1,293      Net Interest Margin5     3.38%     3.49%   (0.11)1Interest income includes loan fees of $27 million and $32 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 2Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-  equivalent basis.

The increase was predominantly driven by higher loan balances, lower interest-bearing liability balances, and continued favorable trends in the deposit mix that included declines in higher cost time deposits. These variances were partially offset by lower average securities and the elimination of the quarterly dividend on Coke stock as a result of our sale and charitable contribution of our remaining Coke shares in the third quarter. Net interest margin decreased by 11 basis points to 3.38% for the third quarter of 2012, compared to 3.49% for the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase in average earning assets at marginally lower yields and a decline in securities yields driven by portfolio repositioning and the elimination of the quarterly Coke dividend, partially offset by an improved funding mix, characterized by increased demand deposits, a decline in higher cost time deposits and borrowings, and lower rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Yields on earning assets declined by 40 basis points to 3.83% during the third quarter of 2012 compared to 4.23% during the same period of 2011, as loans added during the period yielded less than maturing loans, reflecting the current low interest rate environment. Additionally, loan yields in the third quarter of 2012 were impacted by a decline in income derived from interest rate swaps utilized to manage interest rate risk. Yields on earning assets also declined due to the reduction in our securities portfolio due to the absence of attractive investment alternatives and the foregone Coke dividend. Rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 33 basis points over the same period, predominantly due to improved funding mix, as growth in lower cost deposits and wholesale funding replaced higher-cost time deposits and long-term debt that matured, was called, or extinguished during the period. Specifically, during the quarter we benefited from the redemptions of the higher cost trust preferred securities that had a weighted average rate of approximately 7% and the maturity of a large population of higher cost CDs. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin of approximately mid-single digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields, which we expect will partially be offset by lower liability costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect a reduction to net interest income as a result of the lower margin, coupled with our smaller balance sheet due to the closed and pending loan sales. Average earning assets increased by $6.4 billion, or 4%, compared to the third quarter of 2011, predominantly due to the growth in average loans, which increased by $8.4 billion, or 7%, and a $1.3 billion, or 62%, increase in loans held for sale, which increased partially as a result of the transfer of $2.0 billion in loans to held for sale during the quarter. Partially offsetting the increases in loans was a $3.5 billion, or 14%, decrease in our securities AFS portfolio as a result of the Coke stock sale, prepayments, maturities and principal repayments. The increase in loans was attributable to increases in commercial and industrial loans, primarily driven by our large corporate and middle market borrowers, government-guaranteed student loans, guaranteed residential mortgages, high credit quality nonguaranteed residential mortgages, consumer-indirect loans, and other direct loans. These increases were partially offset by declines in nonaccrual loans, home equity products, commercial real estate loans, and commercial construction loans. The declines in home equity, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans predominantly resulted from our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these higher-risk loans. Our loan portfolio yielded 4.12% for the quarter, down 42 basis points from the third quarter of 2011. The yield decline was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment, and the aforementioned lower swap-related income impacting commercial loan yields.We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The largest notional position of these swaps are receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. As of September 30, 2012, the outstanding notional balance of active swaps was $17.4 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared with $15.9 billion as of September 30, 2011. In addition to the income recognized from currently outstanding swaps, we also continue to recognize interest income over the original hedge period resulting from terminated or de-designated swaps in a gain position that were previously designated as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans. Swap income declined to $118 million during the third quarter of 2012 from $159 million during the third quarter of 2011. The $41 million decline was primarily due to a decline in the income from $3.5 billion of previously terminated swaps that reached their original maturity date in April of 2012. Assuming no significant changes to LIBOR, we expect commercial loan swap income to remain relatively stable at the current quarter level for the remainder of the year and first quarter of 2013. Our interest rate risk management practices may cause us from time to time to purchase and/or terminate additional interest rate swaps. In the absence of additions or terminations, our notional balance of active swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of 2013 with remaining maturities through early 2017. The average maturity of our active swap notional balances at September 30, 2012, was 2.6 years.89The commercial loan swaps have a fixed rate of interest that is received, while the rate paid is based on LIBOR. Estimated quarterly income of these swaps based on current expectations of future LIBOR rates is as follows:  Ending Notional Balances of Active Swaps  (in billions) Estimated Income Related to Swaps (in millions)Fourth Quarter 2012 $17.4 $116First Quarter 2013 17.4 113Second Quarter 2013 15.3 100Third Quarter 2013 15.3 92Fourth Quarter 2013 15.3 922014 10.6 331Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $3.2 billion, or 3%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was driven by a $3.4 billion, or 17%, decline in higher cost time deposits, a $1.9 billion, or 14%, decline in long-term debt, and a $1.6 billion, or 4%, decline in money market accounts compared to the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by increases in other short-term borrowings and lower cost client deposits. Total average consumer and commercial deposits increased by $2.4 billion, or 2%, compared to the same period during 2011. This increase was predominantly driven by a $5.9 billion, or 19%, increase in demand deposits, partially offset by the aforementioned decline in higher-cost time deposits driven by the maturity of a large population of higher cost CDs. The growth in lower cost deposits was the result of successful sales efforts and clients’ increased preference for more liquid products. Notwithstanding, we believe our deposit levels may decline modestly during 2013 after the removal of the FDIC's unlimited guarantee on demand deposits, which is expected to revert back to an insurance cap of $250,000 on January 1, 2013. The increase in other short-term borrowings is a result of new FHLB borrowings during the period, which reflects a continuation of the recent trend toward a more normalized funding distribution. The decrease in long-term debt was primarily attributable to the aforementioned redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities at the beginning of the third quarter. The growth in lower cost deposits, the decline in higher cost time deposits, and lower rates on new borrowings that replaced maturing or repurchased higher yielding borrowings, drove the 33 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the same period during 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, the interest rate environment was characterized by a flatter yield curve versus the same period during 2011, as three-month LIBOR increased and rates at the long end of the curve declined. More specifically, during the third quarter of 2012, benchmark rates were as follows compared to the third quarter of 2011; one-month LIBOR averaged 0.24%, an increase of 3 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.43%, an increase of 13 basis points, five-year swaps averaged 0.86%, a decrease of 58 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 1.73%, a decrease of 83 basis points. The Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25% and the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, both unchanged from the third quarter of 2011.First Nine Months of 2012For the first nine months of 2012, net interest income was $3.9 billion, an increase of $94 million, or 2%, from the first nine months of 2011. The increase was predominantly driven by the same factors as discussed above for the third quarter related to higher loan balances and lower interest-bearing liability balances, partially offset by lower average securities AFS and the elimination of the quarterly Coke stock dividend in the third quarter.Average earning assets increased by $7.7 billion, or 5%. The increase in earning assets was predominantly attributable to increases of $8.1 billion, or 7%, in average loans, and $0.8 billion, or 36%, in LHFS, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 6%, in average securities AFS. The increase in average loans was predominantly a result of growth in commercial and industrial loans, government-guaranteed student loans, guaranteed residential mortgages, and consumer-indirect loans, partially offset by declines in nonaccrual loans, home equity products, and commercial real estate loans. The factors contributing to the year-over-year changes in earning assets were the same as those discussed related to the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $0.9 billion, or 1%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011, primarily driven by a $2.8 billion, or 14%, decrease in higher-cost time deposits, a $1.5 billion, or 11%, reduction in long-term debt, and a $0.9 billion, or 2%, decrease in money market accounts, predominantly offset by an increase in other short-term borrowings. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased by $3.8 billion, or 3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was driven by a $6.6 billion, or 22%, increase in demand deposits, partially offset by the aforementioned declines in higher-cost time deposits and money market accounts. The net interest margin was 3.42%, a decline of 10 basis points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Yields on average earning assets declined by 36 basis points to 3.95% for the nine months ended September 30, 902012, from 4.31% for the same period in 2011. The average yield on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was 4.23%, down 40 basis points from the same period in 2011. The factors in the year-over-year decrease in the yield on loans were the same as those discussed above related to the third quarter of 2012. Also contributing to the decline in the yields on average earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was the 54 basis point decline in yields on LHFS , primarily due to the low interest rate environment during the current nine month period compared to the prior year nine month period, and the decline of 25 basis points on securities AFS, primarily due to the Coke sale, prepayments, maturities and principal repayments. The interest rate environment has also allowed active management of interest-bearing liabilities over the same period. The result of this active management was a decrease of 29 basis points in interest-bearing liabilities, due primarily to a 72 basis point decline in long-term debt, as well as a 18 basis point decline in consumer and commercial deposits. A driver of the decline in long-term debt was the redemptions of the higher cost trust preferred securities that had a weighted average rate of approximately 7%. The decline in the deposits was primarily driven by the maturity of higher cost CDs.Foregone InterestForegone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by 7 basis points during the third quarter of 2012 and 9 basis points during the first nine months of 2012, compared with a reduction of 14 basis points and 15 basis points during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, as average nonaccrual loans decreased by $1.0 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and by $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Noninterest income increased by $1.6 billion compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, driven primarily by $1.9 billion in securities gains, partially offset by a higher mortgage repurchase provision of $254 million and $92 million in losses related to the transfer to held for sale of $1.9 billion of student and mortgage loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, noninterest income increased by $1.7 billion, or 62%, also as a result of an higher securities gains partially offset by lower card fees and losses from the transfer to held for sale of student and mortgage loans.Mortgage production related income for the third quarter of 2012 was a loss of $64 million compared to income of $54 million for the third quarter of 2011. The decline in income of $118 million was primarily due to the previously described $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, partially offset by higher loan production and increased gain on sale margins. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, mortgage loan production volume increased compared to the same periods in 2011 to $8.1 billion, a 40% increase, and $24.1 billion, a 48% increase, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, mortgage production related income was $102 million, up $46 million, or 82% as purchase and refinancing activity increased due to the HARP 2.0 program and the continued low interest rate environment. While some volume and margin compression may occur in the coming quarters, we expect overall favorable conditions in the mortgage market in the near term. Higher production volume and gain on sale margins were partially offset by higher repurchase provision. The mortgage repurchase provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, was $371 million and $701 million compared to $117 million and $287 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. The reserve for mortgage repurchases was $694 million at September 30, 2012, an increase of $374 million from December 31, 2011. 91The increase was the result of recent information received from the GSEs, as well as our recent experience related to full file requests and repurchase demands, which enhanced our ability to estimate losses attributable to the remaining expected demands on currently delinquent loans sold to the GSEs prior to 2009. These vintage loans have comprised the vast majority of mortgage repurchase losses to date. Consequently, future mortgage repurchase provisions are expected to decline substantially from levels experienced in recent quarters, and we expect the reserve to decline as losses are realized. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 11, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.Mortgage servicing related income increased by $6 million, or 10%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $13 million, or 6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increases were primarily driven by increased hedge performance, partially offset by decreased servicing income and increased payoffs due to refinancing activity. Trading income decreased by $47 million, or 71%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $26 million, or 15%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decreases were primarily due to higher mark-to-market losses on fair value debt and index-linked CDs compared to gains in 2011, partially offset by higher core trading income and a decline in losses related to previously securitized loans.Other charges and fees decreased by $14 million, or 11%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $25 million, or 6%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decreases were primarily due to lower debit card fee income, lower insurance premium income due to the termination of reinsurance agreements with mortgage insurance companies, and lower letters of credit fee income, partially offset by higher loan commitment fees.Card fees decreased by $49 million, or 47%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $126 million, or 41%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decline was a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the third quarter of 2012 reclassification of $11 million of credit card reward costs, which were previously classified in other expense. We elected to make this reclassification to conform with predominant industry practice. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the decrease in interchange revenue was $50 million and $147 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2011. The estimated impact on interchange revenue as a result of the new interchange rules is consistent with our original expectations of a reduction in interchange revenue of approximately $40 - $50 million per quarter when compared with interchange revenue prior to the new regulations becoming effective.As a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue, we introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients’ needs and which we expect will provide additional sources of fee income. Additionally, we also expect continued benefit from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs, actions taken to reduce the costs related to our debit card operational support, and the introduction of other value-added deposit product features over the next two years, which we expect will produce additional deposit fee income. We believed that these mitigating actions, among others, would assist in recapturing 50% of the lost revenue as a result of recent changes in regulations, including those on overdraft fees (Regulation E) and the new interchange fee rules. Inherent in this assumption was client acceptance of certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide. Since the regulations went into effect, we have experienced a lesser rate of acceptance than originally assumed on certain deposit-related fees and clients have changed their behavior to a greater extent than anticipated, including maintaining higher balances in their deposit accounts to avoid certain fees. As a result, we believe the recapture of lost revenue from the recent changes in regulations will be less than our original estimate and may take longer to achieve than originally planned. Excluding any effect of additional client acceptance of certain deposit-related fees, potential increases in debit card usage by clients, or other mitigating actions we may take, our interchange revenue in future quarters is expected to be consistent with results seen during the third quarter of 2012 as noted above. Investment banking income increased by $15 million, or 22%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and decreased by $1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase relative to the third quarter of 2011 was primarily attributable to higher syndicated finance and bond origination fee income.Net securities gains increased by $1.9 billion compared to both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. The large increases were driven by $1.9 billion of pre-tax gains resulting from the sale and charitable contribution of our Coke common stock, net of early termination of the Agreements, that occurred during the third quarter of 2012. See "Investment in Common Shares of the Coca-Cola Company" in this MD&A for additional information. For further discussion regarding our investment portfolio activity, see “Securities Available for Sale” in this MD&A.Other noninterest income was a loss for the third quarter of 2012 of $31 million compared to income of $53 million for the third quarter of 2011, a decline of $84 million. The decline was the result of a $92 million loss recognized in the third quarter of 2012 upon moving $1.4 billion of current ($0.7 billion) and delinquent ($0.7 billion) student loans and $0.5 billion of delinquent government guaranteed mortgage loans to loans held for sale. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2012, we sold 92$1.0 billion of these loans and anticipate selling the remainder of the student and government guaranteed mortgage loans during the fourth quarter of 2012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, other noninterest income declined $79 million, or 50%, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily resulting from the aforementioned loss related to the transfer of loans to loans held for sale. Excluding the $92 million loss related to the transfer of loans in the third quarter of 2012, other noninterest income increased $8 million and $13 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.NONINTEREST EXPENSE                      Table 4 Three Months Ended September 30 % Nine Months Ended September 30 %(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 Change1 2012 2011 Change1Employee compensation$670 $642 4% $1,977 $1,898 4%Employee benefits110 108 2 363 354 3 Personnel expenses780 750 4 2,340 2,252 4Outside processing and software171 164 4 527 484 9Net occupancy expense92 90 2 267 268 —Marketing and customer development75 41 83 134 125 7Operating losses71 72 (1) 200 161 24Regulatory assessments67 80 (16) 179 232 (23)Credit and collection services65 71 (8) 181 182 (1)Equipment expense49 44 11 140 132 6Other staff expense41 18 NM 75 53 42Consulting and legal fees40 34 18 116 77 51Other real estate expense30 62 (52) 133 195 (32)Amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets17 11 55 39 34 15Net loss/(gain) on debt extinguishment2 (1) NM 15 (3) NMOther expense226 124 82 467 375 25Total noninterest expense$1,726 $1,560 11 $4,813 $4,567 51NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.Noninterest expense increased by $166 million, or 11%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $246 million, or 5%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase over the third quarter of 2011 was primarily due to a $96 million write-down of affordable housing investments, the $38 million charitable contribution of the Coke shares to the SunTrust Foundation, and $29 million in severance expense. Higher compensation expenses were offset by reductions in credit-related cost and regulatory assessments. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011, higher compensation expense related to improved business performance, higher marketing and customer development costs due to the Coke contribution, increased other staff expense due to the severance expense, a $96 million increase as a result of valuation losses on the planned sale of affordable housing investments, and higher operating losses contributed to the increase. The increases were partially offset by a decline in regulatory assessments, other real estate expense, and credit and collection services.Personnel expenses increased by $30 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $88 million, or 4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Increases in both periods were driven by a $28 million and $79 million, or 4%, respectively, increase in employee compensation expense related to higher compensation from improved business performance and modest annual merit increases. Additionally, the third quarter of 2012 also included an increase in incentive compensation cost due to the acceleration of deferred compensation related to organizational changes in certain businesses. Compared to September 30, 2011, full-time equivalent employees declined almost 1,500 and the use of contract labor increased, resulting in lower employee compensation expense and higher contract labor costs. Outside processing and software expenses increased $7 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and $43 million, or 9%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase over the three and nine months ended 2011 was largely due to increased outsourced services and application hosting costs, as well as higher software maintenance charges.Marketing and customer development expense increased $34 million, or 83%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and $9 million, or 7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was attributable to 93the $38 million charitable contribution of the Coke shares in the third quarter of 2012, offset by lower advertising spending which fluctuates based on the timing of advertising campaigns.Operating losses increased $39 million, or 24%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was due to litigation-related expenses, which tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters, as well as operating losses associated with mortgage-related activities.Regulatory assessments expense decreased $13 million, or 16%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and $53 million, or 23%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in both periods was due to a lower FDIC assessment rate, and for the nine month period, the expense was also impacted by a change in the assessment base. Other staff expense increased $23 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and $22 million, or 42%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011, mainly due to the $29 million in severance expense recognized in the third quarter of 2012 due to our continued effort to structure the organization in a manner that enables us to achieve our long-term efficiency ratio target of below 60%.Consulting and legal expenses increased by $6 million, or 18%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $39 million, or 51%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was attributable to consulting costs associated with specific business initiatives, as well as costs to address the mortgage servicing Consent Order. For additional information regarding the Consent Order, see Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.Other real estate expense decreased $32 million, or 52%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and $62 million, or 32%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was predominantly due to a decline in the OREO inventory resulting in lower loss provisioning, combined with a decrease in losses on sales of owned properties. Over time, as the economic environment improves, we expect that other real estate expense will continue to improve, but will likely remain elevated compared with the levels realized prior to the economic recession.Amortization expense and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets increased $6 million, or 55%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and $5 million, or 15%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011, due to a $7 million impairment loss recorded on our GenSpring reporting unit during the third quarter of 2012. Net loss on debt extinguishment increased by $18 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011, due to the $13 million non-cash charges associated with the redemption of higher cost trust preferred securities, which were completed in June and July 2012.Other noninterest expense increased by $102 million, or 82%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011, and by $92 million, or 25%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011, mainly due to a $96 million write-down recognized upon the transfer of affordable housing investments to held for sale in the third quarter of 2012 and $17 million of real estate charges resulting from our reassessment of corporate real estate leases and holdings. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect our core expenses to be flat to down. Cyclically high costs are expected to continue their overall declining trend, and employee compensation is expected to decline. Conversely, certain volume and seasonal-driven line items (for example, outside processing and advertising) may increase. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for income taxes was $551 million and $710 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% and 31%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the provision for income tax was $45 million and $136 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17% and 19%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in these periods. The provision for income taxes differs from the provision using statutory rates primarily due to favorable permanent tax items such as income from lending to tax exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. See additional discussion related to the provision for income taxes in Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.94LOANSWe report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, or classes, which further aggregate loans based upon common risk characteristics.The commercial and industrial loan type includes loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards, and other wholesale lending activities. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial and construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as commercial and industrial loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner-occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.Residential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans, both guaranteed and nonguaranteed. Residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or second lien position. At September 30, 2012, 31% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 69% were in a second lien position. For home equity products in a second lien position, we service 29% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product. Only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing during the remainder of 2012 and 2013, with 94% of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in 2014 or later, and over 50% in 2017 or later. It should be noted that a majority of accounts historically have not converted to amortizing. Based on historical trends, within 12 months of the end of their draw period, approximately 81% of accounts, and approximately 68% of accounts with a balance, closed or refinanced before or soon after converting. We perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure. These activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity second lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent, including when the second lien is still current. In the third quarter, we initiated the monitoring of delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by other parties. Additionally, we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores of borrowers with second liens, as these scores are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency. At September 30, 2012, our home equity second lien loss severity was approximately 95%. Based on guidance from our primary federal banking regulator, we elected to revise our credit policy related to the nonaccrual status of performing second lien loans and reclassified $81 million performing home equity lines, loans, and mortgages that are subordinate to nonaccrual first lien loans as NPLs during the third quarter. Our methodology for calculating the ALLL considers the financial condition of the borrower, either through the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or through the regular refreshing of FICO scores, which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies. Therefore, this change in policy did not have a material impact on the ALLL.Additionally, we implemented a change to our credit policy to recognize charge-offs of second lien home equity loans, lines, and mortgages at 120 days past due based on a recent analysis indicating that a vast majority of these loans are ultimately charged-off. Previously these charge-offs were taken at 180 days past due. This change in policy resulted in $65 million of incremental charge-offs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012.95The loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct (consisting primarily of direct auto loans, loans secured by negotiable collateral, and private student loans), indirect (consisting of loans secured by automobiles, marine, or recreational vehicles), and consumer credit cards. The composition of our loan portfolio is shown in the following table:Loan Portfolio by Types of Loans    Table 5(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011 % Change 2Commercial loans:     Commercial & industrial$52,407 $49,538 6 %Commercial real estate4,491 5,094 (12)Commercial construction808 1,240 (35)Total commercial loans57,706 55,872 3Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - guaranteed4,823 6,672 (28)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed123,925 23,243 3Home equity products15,019 15,765 (5)Residential construction805 980 (18)Total residential loans44,572 46,660 (4)Consumer loans:     Guaranteed student loans5,823 7,199 (19)Other direct2,341 2,059 14Indirect10,781 10,165 6Credit cards594 540 10Total consumer loans 19,539 19,963 (2)LHFI$121,817 $122,495 (1)%LHFS$5,205 $2,353 NM1Includes $390 million and $431 million of loans carried at fair value at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.2 NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Loans Held for InvestmentLHFI have remained relatively flat through the nine months ended September 30, 2012, although, the composition of our loan portfolio has shifted. We have continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy, as we have been successful in both growing targeted commercial and consumer balances and in reducing our exposure to certain higher risk residential and construction loans. Continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios has resulted in a combined $607 million decline in these portfolios during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, and an $8.4 billion decrease since the end of 2008, which has driven a significant improvement in our risk profile over a relatively short period of time. Also contributing to this shift in loan portfolio composition were the sales and transfers to LHFS during the current year of $2.7 billion in government guaranteed mortgages and student loans. Average loans during the three months ended September 30, 2012 totaled $124.1 billion, while period-end loans totaled $121.8 billion at September 30, 2012. Average loans were higher by $2.3 billion compared to period-end loans, which was attributable to the sales and transfers of loans to LHFS during the third quarter, in addition to moderated loan portfolio growth during the third quarter of 2012. See the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section of this MD&A for more information regarding average loan balances.Commercial loans increased $1.8 billion, or 3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Growth was driven by commercial and industrial loans, as a diverse array of large corporate borrowers contributed to a $2.9 billion, or 6%, increase from December 31, 2011. This increase in commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans. Commercial real estate loans declined $603 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2011. The majority of the decline in this portfolio was due to continued runoff, resolution of problem loans, and the transfer of $97 million of commercial NPLs to LHFS during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Approximately half of these transferred loans were sold in the current quarter, and we expect to sell the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2012. These decreases were partially offset by progress made in generating commercial real estate loan production during 2012, where we anticipate seeing some portfolio growth in coming quarters. Commercial construction loans decreased 35% from December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by reducing existing construction exposure. Given the stresses in the commercial real estate market, we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. At least annually and more frequently if credit quality deteriorates, we 96perform a thorough liquidity and contingency analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default by providing a thorough view of borrowers' capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with our clients to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client’s financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the client’s and guarantor’s, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes.Residential loans declined slightly during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, as a result of offsetting portfolio changes. We experienced declines across all residential loan classes except nonguaranteed residential mortgages, which grew $682 million, or 3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, despite transferring $447 million of nonperforming mortgages to LHFS during the current quarter, most of which were sold during the current quarter, and we expect to sell the residual portion in the fourth quarter of 2012. The overall increase in our nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio was a result of lower interest rates generating new loan growth and greater origination volume, net of payoffs, offsetting much of the declines in the remaining residential classes. Nonguaranteed residential mortgage loan growth came predominantly from borrowers with high FICO scores (i.e. 760 or above) and lower LTV ratios. Conversely, government-guaranteed residential mortgages decreased $1.8 billion, or 28%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, in part due to our decision to sell approximately $1.0 billion of guaranteed residential mortgages during the second and third quarters. The government guaranteed mortgages transferred to LHFS in the third quarter are expected to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2012. Our election to sell a portion of this guaranteed portfolio was part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, as recent quarters have yielded organic growth and the higher-risk loan balances have declined.Consumer loans decreased $424 million, or 2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, driven by the transfer of $1.7 billion in government guaranteed student loans to LHFS during the year, $1.4 billion of which were transferred during the third quarter. Approximately $700 million of these $1.4 billion of student loans were delinquent, and approximately $1.0 billion of the student loans that moved to LHFS during the third quarter were sold in October 2012, with the remainder expected to be sold by the end of the fourth quarter. We also expect to transfer approximately $600 million of additional student loans to LHFS in the fourth quarter of 2012 that did not meet the held for sale accounting criteria at September 30, 2012. We do not expect the gain or loss associated with the fourth quarter transfer to be material. Reduction in guaranteed student loans was partially offset by growth across all other consumer loan classes, with indirect and other direct loans increasing $616 million, or 6%, and $282 million, or 14%, respectively.Loans Held for SaleLHFS increased $2.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to the transfer of $1.4 billion of current and delinquent government guaranteed student loans and $500 million of delinquent government guaranteed residential mortgages to LHFS during the third quarter of 2012, as we elected to actively market these loans for sale. While all of these transferred loans were included in LHFS at September 30, over half were subsequently sold in October, and the remainder is expected to be sold by year end. Also contributing to the increase in LHFS was the increase in closed mortgage loan volume as a result of the continued low interest rate environment and expanded refinance programs announced by the U.S. government in 2012.Asset QualityOur overall asset quality continued to demonstrate favorable trends during 2012, as NPL sales contributed to the decline in nonperforming assets and elevated net charge-offs during the third quarter. NPLs declined 40% from December 31, 2011, and totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2012. Net charge-offs increased $161 million, or 46%, compared to the second quarter of 2012 and decreased $285 million, or 18%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. The annualized net charge-off ratio fell to 1.64% and 1.39% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to 1.69% and 1.82% for the same periods in 2011. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 0.53% of total loans from 0.68% at December 31, 2011. Total early stage delinquencies also improved to 0.95% as of September 30, 2012 from 1.17% as of December 31, 2011. The gradual improvement in our asset quality trends have been driven by aggressively and intentionally reducing our higher-risk loan balances combined with actively managing the size and quality of our government guaranteed loan portfolio over the past several years. These actions, coupled with our loan sales announced during the third quarter of 2012 and our level of government guaranteed loans at 97September 30, 2012, have resulted in a much improved risk profile and a loan portfolio that more closely aligns with our longer-term balance sheet targets.Our nonperforming loans have declined significantly since their peak in 2009, down by $3.8 billion, or almost 70%, and this quarter we took actions that further accelerated this decline by selling approximately $500 million of NPLs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, NPLs decreased by $1.2 billion, or 40%, which was evident across all of our loan classes, most prominently in our nonguaranteed residential mortgages. Commercial construction and commercial real estate NPLs also demonstrated significant reductions, declining by a combined $384 million, or 66%, during the same period. At September 30, 2012, the percentage of NPLs to total loans was 1.42%, down 95 basis points from December 31, 2011.Net charge-offs totaled $511 million and $1.3 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $492 million and $1.6 billion during the same periods in 2011, respectively. Included in the current quarter was $172 million in charge-offs associated with the sale of NPLs, as well as $65 million in charge-offs from the second lien credit policy change, as further discussed in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section of this MD&A. Excluding the net charge-offs associated with these NPL sales and the credit policy change, net charge-offs were $274 million during the quarter, down $76 million from the second quarter of 2012. Core net charge-offs have trended favorably for some time, and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters; however, we could see some increase in the fourth quarter as a result of normal seasonality, and the fact that our recoveries were about $30 million higher this quarter than what we have experienced recently.Early stage delinquencies reached their lowest level in several quarters at 0.95% at September 30, 2012, led by a 36 basis point decrease from year end in nonguaranteed residential loans. At September 30, 2012 all residential loan classes showed improvement compared to December 31, 2011, with residential construction demonstrating the largest improvement, improving 70 basis points. We would expect future early stage delinquency ratio improvements to be driven by residential loans, as they are still elevated by historical standards. The overall economy, particularly changes in unemployment, will influence any additional improvement.In light of the continued favorable trends in credit quality, the ALLL slightly declined to $2.2 billion at September 30, 2012, down $218 million from December 31, 2011. The ALLL represented 1.84% of total loans at September 30, 2012, down 17 basis points from year end. Overall, we were pleased with our improved risk profile and positive trends in credit metrics. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends, with additional improvements propelled by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently approaching more normal credit metric levels.We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 3, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.The following table shows the percentage breakdown of our total LHFI portfolio by geographic region:Loan Types by Geography         Table 6 Commercial Residential Consumer September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011 September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011 September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Geography:           Central127% 28% 21% 21% 15% 14%Florida219 20 26 27 18 18MidAtlantic325 26 37 36 26 25 Other29 26 16 16 41 43Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%1 The Central region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.2 The Florida region includes Florida only.3 The MidAtlantic region includes the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.98ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESAt September 30, 2012, the allowance for credit losses was $2.3 billion, which consists of both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience, is shown in the table below:Summary of Credit Losses Experience          Table 7 Three Months Ended September 30   Nine Months Ended September 30  (Dollars in millions)2012 2011 % Change 5 2012 2011 % Change 5Allowance for Credit Losses           Balance - beginning of period$2,350 $2,795 (16)% $2,505 $3,032 (17)%(Benefit)/provision for unfunded commitments— (1) (100) 2 (8) NMProvision for loan losses:           Commercial loans127 86 48 214 318 (33)Residential loans300 236 27 788 810 (3)Consumer loans23 26 (12) 63 66 (5)Total provision for loan losses450 348 29 1,065 1,194 (11)Charge-offs:           Commercial loans(126) (214) (41) (346) (619) (44)Residential loans(425) (282) 51 (1,001) (970) 3Consumer loans(34) (40) (15) (98) (125) (22)Total charge-offs(585) (536) 9 (1,445) (1,714) (16)Recoveries:           Commercial loans55 29 90 111 99 12Residential loans10 3 NM 21 14 50Consumer loans9 12 (25) 30 33 (9)Total recoveries74 44 68 162 146 11Net charge-offs(511) (492) 4 (1,283) (1,568) (18)Balance - end of period$2,289 $2,650 (14)% $2,289 $2,650 (14)%Components:           ALLL$2,239 $2,600 (14)%      Unfunded commitments reserve 150 50 —      Allowance for credit losses$2,289 $2,650 (14)%    Average loans$124,080 $115,638 7% $123,332 $115,242 7%Period-end loans outstanding121,817 117,475 4     Ratios:           ALLL to period-end loans 2,31.84% 2.22% (17%)     ALLL to NPLs 4130 81 60     ALLL to net charge-offs (annualized)1.10x 1.33x (17)      Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)1.64% 1.69% (3)% 1.39% 1.82% (24)%1 The unfunded commitments reserve is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.2 $390 million and $452 million, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from period-end loans in the calculation.3 Excluding government-guaranteed loans of $10.6 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively, from period-end loans in the calculation results in ratios of 2.02% and 2.42%, respectively.4 $14 million and $26 million, respectively, of NPLs carried at fair value were excluded from NPLs in the calculation.5 NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Charge-offsNet charge-offs increased by $19 million, or 4%, during the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net charge-offs declined by $285 million, or 18%, versus the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 1.64% and 1.39% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, a reduction of 5 and 43 basis points, respectively, from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. The changes in net charge-offs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same periods during the prior year were largely driven by $172 million in net 99charge-offs associated with nonperforming residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan sales that were part of strategic actions announced in September, as well as the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental charge-offs related to our second lien policy change. Prior to our second lien policy change, we charged-off second lien loans at 180 days past due, but during the third quarter we implemented a change in credit policy to recognize the charge-off at 120 days past due. Refer to Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional policy information. These increases to charge-offs were partially offset by improvements in credit quality driving lower core net charge-offs. Core net charge-offs have trended favorably for some time, including during the third quarter when excluding the loan sales and policy change noted above, and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters. However, we may experience some increase in core net charge-offs during the fourth quarter from third quarter levels due to normal seasonality in the fourth quarter and higher recoveries we experienced this quarter, along with the possibility of a regulatory change in loss recognition of certain consumer bankruptcy-related loans.Provision for Credit LossesThe total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses, as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. For the three months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for loan losses was up $102 million, or 29%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for loan losses was down $129 million, or 11%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The change in the provision for loan losses for both periods was largely attributable to higher incremental charge-offs associated with nonperforming loan sales and our credit policy change; however, those incremental charge-offs were fully offset by improvements in core credit quality trends and lower core net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.For the three months ended September 30, 2012, there was no provision for unfunded commitments, compared to a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for unfunded commitments was $2 million, compared to a benefit of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.ALLL and Reserve for Unfunded CommitmentsAllowance for Loan Losses by Loan Segment Table 8 As of September 30, 2012 As of December 31, 2011(Dollars in millions)ALLL  Segment ALLLas a % oftotal ALLL Loan segmentas a % oftotal loans ALLL Segment ALLLas a % oftotal ALLL Loan segmentas a % oftotal loansCommercial loans$943 42% 47% $964 39% 46%Residential loans1,162 52 37 1,354 55 38Consumer loans134 6 16 139 6 16Total$2,239 100% 100% $2,457 100% 100%The ALLL decreased by $218 million, or 9%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, with commercial, residential, and consumer loans-related ALLL declining $21 million, $192 million, and $5 million, respectively. The decrease in ALLL was reflective of the continued improvement in core credit quality trends of our loan portfolio as evidenced by reductions in higher-risk balances, lower NPLs, and improved early stage delinquencies. Our risk profile continued to improve, as the amount of certain higher-risk loans continued to decline, while lower-risk government guaranteed loans comprised 9% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2012. The variables most impacting the ALLL continue to be unemployment, residential real estate property values, and the variability and relative strength of the housing market. As of September 30, 2012, the ALLL to period-end loans ratio was 1.84%, down 17 basis points from December 31, 2011, consistent with continued improvement in asset quality. When excluding government guaranteed loans, the ALLL to period-end loans declined to 2.02% at September 30, 2012, compared to 2.27% at December 31, 2011. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs was 130% as of September 30, 2012, compared to 85% as of December 31, 2011. The increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $1.2 billion decline in NPLs, partially offset by the reduction in ALLL.The reserve for unfunded commitments was $50 million as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $2 million, up 4% compared to $48 million at December 31, 2011.100NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe following table presents our nonperforming assets:     Table 9(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011 % Change 3Nonaccrual/NPLs:     Commercial loans      Commercial & industrial$288 $348 (17)%Commercial real estate119 288 (59)Commercial construction75 290 (74)Total commercial NPLs482 926 (48)Residential loans     Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed786 1,392 (44)Home equity products310 338 (8)Residential construction129 220 (41)Total residential NPLs1,225 1,950 (37)Consumer loans     Other direct6 7 (14)Indirect18 20 (10)Total consumer NPLs24 27 (11)Total nonaccrual/NPLs1,731 2,903 (40)OREO1304 479 (37)Other repossessed assets10 10 —Nonperforming LHFS40 — NMTotal nonperforming assets$2,085 $3,392 (39)%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$1,104 $2,028 (46)%Accruing LHFS past due 90 days or more1,127 3 NMTDRs:     Accruing restructured loans $2,640 $2,820 (6)%Nonaccruing restructured loans2482 802 (40)Ratios:     NPLs to total loans1.42% 2.37% (40)%Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO, other repossessed assets, and nonperforming LHFS1.71 2.76 (38)1 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $143 million and $132 million at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.2 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.3 NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.Nonperforming assets decreased $1.3 billion, or 39%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Overall, the decrease was attributed to a $1.2 billion, or 40%, decline in NPLs noted across all loan classes, and largely driven by a $606 million, or 44%, reduction in the nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs. Much of the reduction in NPLs was attributable to the transfer of $660 million of certain residential mortgage and commercial real estate NPLs to held for sale during 2012, and the completion of these sales during the second and third quarters of 2012, except for the remaining $40 million in residential mortgage and commercial real estate NPLs that were held for sale as of September 30, 2012 and included in NPAs. The decline in NPLs was slightly offset by an $81 million increase as a result of classifying as NPLs performing second lien loans that were subordinate to nonaccrual first lien loans. The decision to transfer these performing second liens to NPLs was driven by regulatory guidance issued during 2012. At quarter end, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.42%, down from 2.37% at year end. Our ALLL to NPL ratio improved 45 basis points from year end and was 130% at September 30, 2012.Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the condition of the U.S. housing market. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, 101primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may continue to impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming assets portfolio.Nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, and TDR loans, are problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses that are disclosed in the nonperforming assets table above. Loans with potential credit problems that may not otherwise be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans, which are disclosed along with additional credit quality information in Note 3, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there are no significant potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed.During the third quarter of 2012, a national bank regulatory agency other than our primary federal regulator issued guidance related to certain loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy for which the borrower has not reaffirmed that may require them to be accounted for as TDRs and collateral dependent NPLs, regardless of their actual payment history and expected performance. At September 30, 2012, we had approximately $350 million of performing loans that may be impacted by this guidance. Of these performing loans, approximately 30% are classified as accruing TDRs, approximately 78% are current and have made more than 6 payments, and approximately 96% are less than 60 days past due. We are working closely with our regulators to evaluate the impact of this new guidance and expect to finalize this analysis during the fourth quarter of 2012. This evaluation may result in additional TDRs and possible increases to NPLs, provision for loan losses, and charge-offs during the fourth quarter.Nonperforming LoansNonperforming residential loans were the largest driver of the overall decline in NPLs, decreasing $725 million, down 37%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The reduction in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs accounted for $606 million of this decline, primarily due to the transfer of $563 million of residential mortgage NPLs to LHFS during 2012, the majority of which were sold prior to September 30, 2012. Reductions in residential construction and home equity NPLs also contributed to the decline, decreasing $91 million and $28 million, respectively, mainly attributable to net charge-offs and lower inflows into NPLs. We expect some variability in inflows of nonperforming residential loans during the remainder of 2012, primarily as a result of mortgage loan repurchases from investors. See additional discussion of mortgage loan repurchases in Note 11, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Noninterest Income" section of this MD&A.Nonperforming commercial loans also contributed to the reduction in NPLs, declining $444 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Specifically, the 48% reduction in nonperforming commercial loans was predominantly driven by a $215 million reduction in commercial construction NPLs and a $169 million reduction in commercial real estate NPLs, which included the transfer of $97 million of commercial real estate NPLs to LHFS, as the Company elected to actively market these loans for sale during the third quarter of 2012. Approximately half of the transferred loans were sold by September 30, 2012 with the remainder expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. As we move through current commercial real estate market conditions, we continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate NPLs.Interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not typically recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero. We recognized $8 million and $7 million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $22 million and $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $37 million and $58 million during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $123 million and $194 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, would have been recognized.Other Nonperforming AssetsOREO decreased $175 million, or 37%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The decline consisted of net decreases of $92 million in residential construction related properties, $66 million in residential homes, and $17 million in commercial properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $362 million and $474 million, respectively, contributing to net gains on sales of OREO of $18 million and less than $1 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves, primarily related to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 40% and 33%, respectively, of OREO as of September 30, 2012; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written 102down to their then-current estimated value, less costs to sell. Any further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.At September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, total accruing loans past due ninety days or more included LHFI and LHFS and totaled $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Accruing LHFI past due ninety days or more decreased by $924 million, or 46%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, while accruing LHFS past due ninety days or more increased by $1.1 billion during the same period. The changes were primarily driven by the transfer of certain government guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans from LHFI to LHFS during the third quarter as part of our strategic actions announced in September. The majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency, which comprised 97% of past due accruing loans at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. During the same periods, $63 million and $57 million, respectively, of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were not guaranteed.At the end of 2010, we completed an internal review of STM’s residential foreclosure processes. Since that review, we have continued to improve upon our processes as a result of our review. Additionally, following the Federal Reserve's horizontal review of the nation’s largest mortgage loan servicers, SunTrust and other servicers entered into Consent Orders with the FRB. We describe the Consent Order in Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and a copy of it was filed as Exhibit 10.25 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. Additionally, borrowers who had a residential foreclosure action pending during this two-year review period have been solicited through advertising and direct mailings to request a review by the independent consultant of their case if they believe they incurred a financial injury as a result of errors, misrepresentations or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process. The deadline for submitting requests for review has been extended to December 31, 2012, and direct mail, internet, and media efforts to reach borrowers will continue. These requirements prescribed by the Consent Order may result in additional delays in the foreclosure process at a time when the time required for foreclosure upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, continues to be elevated. These delays in the foreclosure process have adversely affected us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and by exposing us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. These delays have also resulted, in some cases, in an inability to meet certain investor foreclosure timelines for loans we service for others, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in the assessment of compensatory fees.Restructured LoansTo maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms.Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as accruing TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market at the time of the modification. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies. Roll rate models used to forecast losses on the residential mortgage and consumer TDRs are calculated and analyzed separately using their own portfolio attributes and history, thereby reflecting an increased PD compared to loans that have not been restructured. The level of re-103defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $328 million and $405 million, respectively. See Note 3, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.The following tables display our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status. Guaranteed loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled $51 million and $65 million at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.Selected Residential TDR Data          Table 10 As of September 30, 2012 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$441 $38 $479 $23 $48 $71Term extension17 7 24 1 10 11Rate reduction and term extension1,681 219 1,900 41 258 299Other 218 3 21 1 4 5Total$2,157 $267 $2,424 $66 $320 $386             As of December 31, 2011 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$473 $40 $513 $16 $69 $85Term extension20 10 30 2 24 26Rate reduction and term extension1,682 290 1,972 35 439 474Other 220 3 23 2 15 17Total$2,195 $343 $2,538 $55 $547 $6021 TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.2 Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.At September 30, 2012, our total TDR portfolio was $3.1 billion and was composed of $2.8 billion, or 90%, of residential loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $246 million, or 8%, of commercial loans (predominantly income-producing properties), and $66 million, or 2%, of direct consumer loans.Total TDRs declined $500 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Nonaccruing TDRs were a significant portion of this total reduction, down $320 million, or 40%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2012. Accruing TDRs also contributed to the overall decline in TDRs, decreasing by $180 million. Reductions were primarily driven by loan sale transactions and net charge-offs during the third quarter, as well as repayments and a general decrease in the loan balances modified during the year. See additional discussion in Note 3, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such interest income recorded was $28 million and $29 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $85 million and $84 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $38 million and $40 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $115 million and $116 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, would have been recognized.104SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUEThe following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Trading Assets and LiabilitiesTrading assets increased $102 million, or 2%, since December 31, 2011, driven by normal changes in trading portfolio product mix including agency mortgage-backed securities and trading loans. This increase was predominantly offset by a decrease in CP and derivatives. Gross derivative assets decreased $230 million, but were partially offset by a decrease of $163 million in cash collateral. See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 12, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on trading assets.Trading liabilities decreased $348 million, or 19%, since December 31, 2011, predominantly due to a decrease in derivatives and U.S. Treasury securities, offset by an increase in corporate and other debt securities as a result of normal business activity. Gross derivative liabilities decreased $178 million, due to a $189 million decline as a result of the early termination of the hedges related to the sale of the Coke common stock, and an increase of $170 million in cash collateral. See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 12, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on trading liabilities.105Securities Available for Sale      Table 12 September 30, 2012(Dollars in millions)AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains UnrealizedLosses FairValueU.S. Treasury securities$213 $11 $— $224Federal agency securities1,713 89 — 1,802U.S. states and political subdivisions343 18 6 355MBS - agency16,705 881 — 17,586MBS - private213 4 — 217ABS260 5 4 261Corporate and other debt securities42 4 — 46Other equity securities1975 1 — 976Total securities AFS$20,464 $1,013 $10 $21,4671At September 30, 2012, other equity securities included the following securities at cost: $432 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $401 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and $141 million in mutual fund investments.

The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $21.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, a decrease of $6.7 billion, or 24%, compared with December 31, 2011. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the nine months reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio while managing our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile. During the first nine months of 2012, we repositioned U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities into agency MBS in an effort to capture better relative value. Subsequently, we reduced the size of the securities portfolio by selling low coupon agency MBS and not reinvesting principal cash flow due to the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2012, we disposed of the Coke common stock through a combination of market sales, sales to the Coke Counterparty to the Agreements, and a charitable contribution. The sales, charitable contribution, and the early termination of the Agreements resulted in net securities gains of $1.9 billion and the charitable contribution also increased noninterest expense by $38 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we recorded $2.0 billion in net realized gains from the sale of securities AFS as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio, compared with net realized gains of $98 million during the same period in 2011, including $7 million and $2 million of OTTI during 2012 and 2011, respectively. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see Note 2, "Securities Available for Sale," and the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.At September 30, 2012, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $1.0 billion in net unrealized gains. At December 31, 2011, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.9 billion in net unrealized gains, which included a $2.1 billion unrealized gain from our shares of Coke common stock and an $848 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. The net unrealized gains, excluding the impact from the Coke stock, increased due to the market value increase on the remainder 106of the portfolio experienced during the first nine months of 2012. The Coke common stock was subject to variable forward agreements which are discussed in Note 10, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the "Investment in Common shares of the Coca-Cola Company" in this MD&A.For the three months ended September 30, 2012, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 2.78%, compared with 3.33% from the three months ended September 30, 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 3.05%, compared with 3.30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities, reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower yields, and the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock, which was approximately $15 million per quarter, drove the decline in yield on securities AFS. Our total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 1.8 years as of September 30, 2012, compared to 2.3 years as of December 31, 2011. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 1.8 years suggests an expected price change of 1.8% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.The credit quality and liquidity profile of the securities portfolio remained strong at September 30, 2012, and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns.Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends and our overall liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment portfolio could change meaningfully over time. INVESTMENT IN COMMON SHARES OF THE COCA-COLA COMPANYBackgroundPrior to September 2012, we had owned common shares of Coke since 1919, when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of Coke's IPO and received common shares of Coke in lieu of underwriting fees. These shares had grown in value over the past 93 years and had been classified as securities AFS with unrealized gains, net of tax, recorded as a component of shareholders' equity. Because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares, we had accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders' equity. As of December 31, 2011, we owned 30 million Coke shares with an accounting cost basis of approximately $69,000 and a fair market value of $2.1 billion. On August 10, 2012, we received an additional 30 million Coke shares as a result of the Coke Stock Split. As of September 30, 2012, we had divested our ownership of Coke shares through sales in the market, sales to the counterparty to the Agreements discussed below, and a charitable contribution of 1 million shares.Termination of Agreements Involving Coca-Cola StockIn 2008, we entered into two Agreements with an unaffiliated third party. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, we were to deliver to the counterparty either a variable number of our shares in Coke or an equivalent amount of cash in lieu of such shares on the 2014 and 2015 settlement dates. The counterparty was to deliver to us cash of no less than a floor price of approximately $19 per Coke share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the “Minimum Proceeds”), and no more than a ceiling price of approximately $33 per Coke share (prices are adjusted for the Coke Stock Split). Because we expected to sell our shares around the settlement date, either under the terms of the Agreements or in another market transaction, the Federal Reserve granted us Tier 1 common capital credit of approximately $730 million, which was reflective of the after-tax value of the Coke shares at the floor price. By retaining the shares from 2008 until now, we were able to continue receiving the Coke dividends and participate in the price appreciation of the Coke shares. We recently reevaluated these holdings in light of the recently issued regulatory proposal regarding Basel III, which, as proposed, would increase the risk-weighted assets of equity holdings and introduce potential volatility to our regulatory capital ratios via fluctuations in AOCI, and the negative implications associated with equity securities in assumed adverse economic scenarios within future CCAR assessments. Following this review, we and the counterparty accelerated the termination of the Agreements. Contemporaneously with entering into the Agreements in 2008, the Coke Counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by the Bank and SunTrust (collectively, the “Notes”) in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds. Upon termination of the Agreements, we also repurchased the Notes from the counterparty, resulting in a $2 million loss recorded as an extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended September 30, 2012. As a result of the Coke stock sales, charitable contribution, termination of the Agreements, and repurchase of the Notes, we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2012. 107BORROWINGS                               Short-Term Borrowings              Table 13 As of September 30, 2012 Three Months Ended September 30, 2012 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012   Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End(Dollars in millions)Balance Rate Balance Rate  Balance Rate Funds purchased1$680 0.09% $701 0.11% $821 $793 0.11% $908Securities sold under agreements to repurchase11,630 0.18 1,461 0.18 1,630 1,580 0.17 1,781FHLB advances4,500 0.31 4,886 0.30 5,000 5,832 0.23 9,000Other short-term borrowings22,011 0.33 1,778 0.31 2,011 1,757 0.34 2,011                 As of September 30, 2011 Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011     Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End(Dollars in millions)Balance Rate Balance Rate  Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$998 0.06% $1,069 0.11% $1,090 $1,061 0.14% $1,169Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 12,016 0.14 2,170 0.15 2,182 2,245 0.15 2,411FHLB advances1,000 0.14 111 0.15 1,000 37 0.15 1,000Other short-term borrowings 22,218 0.30 2,952 0.41 3,190 2,883 0.40 3,1901Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of borrowings.2Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral, U.S. Treasury demand notes, CP, and other short-term borrowed funds.Short-Term BorrowingsAs of September 30, 2012, our period-end short-term borrowings increased by $2.6 billion, or 42%, from September 30, 2011, due predominantly to a $3.5 billion increase in short-term FHLB advances as a result of utilization of the FHLB advance program as an alternative for shorter term funding. The increase was partially offset by a $386 million decrease in securities sold under agreement to repurchase, a decrease of $318 million in funds purchased, and a $160 million decrease in U.S. Treasury demand notes. Average short-term borrowings increased by $2.5 billion, or 40%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased average FHLB advances of $4.8 billion, partially offset by a decline in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $709 million, a decrease in average dealer collateral of $614 million, which was reclassified in the third quarter of 2011 to offset derivatives, a decrease in average funds purchased of $368 million, and a $149 million decline in average U.S. Treasury demand notes. For the first nine months of 2012, average short-term borrowings increased by $3.7 billion, or 60%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased average FHLB advances of $5.8 billion, partially offset by a decrease in average dealer collateral of $732 million, which was reclassified in the third quarter of 2011 to offset derivatives, a decline in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $665 million, a decrease in average funds purchased of $268 million, and a decrease of $135 million in average U.S. Treasury demand notes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, our period-end outstanding balances for funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and other short-term borrowings were not materially different from maximum monthly outstanding balances or from the daily averages. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our period-end FHLB advances were materially different than the maximum monthly outstanding balance as a result of higher holdings of FHLB borrowings at certain points during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, due to ordinary balance sheet management practices. There were no short-term FHLB advances outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increases in short-term borrowings were primarily the result of utilization of the FHLB advance program as an alternative to other shorter term funding and more expensive longer term funding.108Long-Term DebtDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our period-end outstanding balances of long-term debt decreased by $143 million, which was primarily due to an increase in long-term FHLB advances of $4.0 billion, as part of an interest rate risk management strategy, offset by the repurchase of $1.2 billion of fixed rate subordinated notes that were due in 2036 and 2068, the extinguishment of $1.2 billion of ten-year floating rate senior unsubordinated notes related to the Coke transaction, the maturity and redemption of $1.4 billion of floating rate senior unsubordinated notes and $589 million of five-year floating rate senior foreign denominated unsubordinated notes. Consequently, the change in our debt mix has resulted in lower rates paid. Average long-term debt decreased by $1.9 billion, or 14%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in average unsubordinated other long-term debt of $3.1 billion, a decrease in average unsubordinated foreign-denominated long-term debt of $1.7 billion, and a decrease in average subordinated other long-term debt of $1.3 billion, partially offset by increased average long-term FHLB advances of $4.0 billion. For the first nine months of 2012, average long-term debt decreased by $1.5 billion, or 11%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.9 billion decline in average unsubordinated other long-term debt, a decrease of $1.3 billion in average unsubordinated foreign-denominated long-term debt, a decline of $726 million in average subordinated other long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in average long-term FHLB advances of $2.6 billion.As of September 30, 2012, we have no outstanding government guaranteed debt issued under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. There have been no other material changes in our long-term debt as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.CAPITAL RESOURCESOur primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures (RWA) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Additionally, mark-to-market adjustments related to our estimated credit spreads for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital.Both the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of RWA. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average total assets, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.In September 2010, the BCBS announced new regulatory capital requirements (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements, through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements, new capital conservation buffers, and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure. Basel III would impose a new "Common Equity Tier 1" requirement of up to 7%, comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5%. The BCBS has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional, counter-cyclical capital buffer on top of Basel III standards. Furthermore, in June 2012, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC issued several joint NPRs to address the implementation of the proposed Basel III regulatory capital framework for U.S. financial institutions, including proposed minimum capital requirements, definitions of qualifying capital instruments, and risk-weighted asset calculations. As proposed, we expect that our risk-weighted assets will increase primarily due to increased risk-weightings for residential mortgages, commercial real estate loans, and home equity loans, and this will result in a decline in our capital ratios. We continue to analyze the NPR; however, as currently proposed, we estimate our current Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would be approximately 8.0%, which would be in compliance with the proposed requirements. See "Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Measures" in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the proposed Basel III ratio. The agencies are expected to consider the feedback and draft a final rule, which could take several quarters to complete. Accordingly, the final rule may differ from the current NPR. Further, the NPR indicates a phase-in for the new capital rules with the proposed risk-weightings requirement not becoming effective until 2015. Notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the timing and content of the final rule, our current Tier 1 common ratio estimate calculated using the NPR assumptions does not include the effect of any mitigating actions we may undertake to offset some of the anticipated impact of the proposed capital changes. Our estimate of the current period Tier 1 common ratio under the NPR was calculated using the assumptions prescribed in the NPR, which can be found 109on the Federal Reserve's website. We monitor our capital structure to ensure it complies with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and are taking into account these proposed regulations in our capital and strategic planning.Capital Ratios  Table 14(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Tier 1 capital$14,178 $14,490Total capital17,369 18,177RWA134,086 132,940Tier 1 common equity:   Tier 1 capital$14,178 $14,490Less:   Qualifying trust preferred securities627 1,854Preferred stock275 275Allowable minority interest115 107Tier 1 common equity$13,161 $12,254Risk-based ratios:   Tier 1 common equity19.82% 9.22%Tier 1 capital10.57 10.90Total capital12.95 13.67Tier 1 leverage ratio8.49 8.75Total shareholders’ equity to assets11.78 11.351 At September 30, 2012, our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as calculated under the recent NPRs was estimated to be 8.0%. See "Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Measures" in the "Selected Quarterly Financial Data" section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the proposed Basel III ratio.Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and total capital ratios were 9.82%, 10.57%, and 12.95%, respectively, at September 30, 2012, compared with 9.22%, 10.90%, and 13.67%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The increase in the Tier 1 common equity ratio was driven by year to date earnings. The decrease in our Tier 1 and total capital ratios was primarily a result of the impact of the redemption of $38 million of trust preferred securities in the second quarter and the redemption of an additional $1.2 billion in July. At September 30, 2012, our capital ratios remain strong, exceeding current regulatory requirements, and are still expected to comply with the proposed requirements under the NPR as discussed above. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $81 million, or $0.15 per common share, compared with $37 million, or $0.07 per common share during the same period in 2011. Additionally, we declared and paid dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2012, and 2011 of $8 million and $5 million, respectively, on our preferred stock. Further, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we declared and paid dividends of $60 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock. We remain subject to certain considerations affecting our ability to increase our dividend. If we increase our quarterly dividend above $0.54 per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the CPP, then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the CPP will be proportionately adjusted. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, for additional considerations regarding the level of future dividends. Additionally, limits exist on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank. At September 30, 2012, retained earnings of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company totaled approximately $1.4 billion; however, use of this amount for payment of dividends to the Parent Company is subject to regulatory approval by federal and state bank regulatory authorities.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThese financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we elected to revise our credit policy related to the nonaccrual status and timing of charge-off recognition of second lien loans. We began classifying second lien loans as nonaccrual when the first lien loan is classified as nonaccrual, even if the second lien loan is performing, and as a result, we reclassified $81 million of performing second lien loans to nonaccrual. Additionally, we previously charged-off second lien loans at 180 days past due, but implemented a change in policy in the third quarter of 2012 to recognize the charge-off at 120 days past due as the analysis indicated that when a second lien loan becomes 120 days past due, the vast majority of these loans ultimately experience a charge-off. The change in credit policy resulted in $65 million of incremental charge-offs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012. 110ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTThere have been no significant changes in our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, except as discussed below.Credit Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our credit risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.Operational Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of NII and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of our balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately 56% of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, are approximately 42% of total loans.We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk.Market Risk from Non-Trading ActivitiesThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No limit breaches occurred during the first nine months of 2012.The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, which as described in additional detail below, are employed by management to understand NII at risk and MVE at risk. These measures show that our interest rate risk profile is relatively neutral. MVE and NII sensitivity are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together. NII sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and is considered a shorter term measure, while MVE sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments' respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure. A positive NII sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one-year, asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to balance sheet composition. A negative MVE sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that value of the financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities. A negative 100 basis point scenario is less meaningful in the current interest rate environment as interest rates are not expected to be negative in the model, thus, different term points in the calculation cannot decrease by the full 100 basis points, which impact exposures in a non-intuitive manner.One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model NII from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of NII over a two year time horizon, which differs from the interest rate sensitivities in Tables 15 and 16 which are prescribed to be over a one year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project NII under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid 111and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on NII levels and sensitivities.The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in NII due to an instantaneous 100 basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed. The NII profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates.Interest Rate Sensitivity from an Economic Perspective  Table 15 Estimated % Change in NIIOver 12 Months(Basis points)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Rate Change   +1002.2% 1.5%-1001(1.5)% (1.8)%1 Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading derivatives. Therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading income from a financial reporting perspective.Interest Rate Sensitivity from a Financial Reporting Perspective  Table 16 Estimated % Change in NIIOver 12 Months(Basis points)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Rate Change   +1002.4% 1.8%-1001(1.6)% (2.0)%1 Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.The difference from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012, seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to the +100 basis point shock scenario is primarily due to an increase in asset sensitivity from projected balance sheet growth of floating rate assets and fixed rate deposits.We also perform valuation analysis, which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the NII simulation analysis above. Whereas NII simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the NII simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the NII simulation model. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios.The +100 basis point MVE sensitivity scenario depicts a slight gain of value as rates increase which indicates asset durations are slightly shorter than liability durations. The increase in NII for the same scenario indicates a greater amount of assets than liabilities repricing to higher yields over the next year. Comparing both profiles indicates a balance sheet with a slightly shorter weighted average duration of assets combined with a higher percentage of floating rate assets compared to liabilities.As of September 30, 2012, the MVE profile indicates changes with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. However, results at September 30, 2012, in the downward rate shock were significantly less meaningful than the upward rate shock. In a -100 shock scenario, current interest rate levels that 112are already at or near 0% are adversely impacting discounted cash flow analysis causing the short end of the discount curve to be zero bound and therefore, the shock behaves more like a curve flattener than a parallel shock. These impact sensitivity measures in a non-intuitive manner.Market Value of Equity Sensitivity  Table 17 Estimated % Change in MVE(Basis points)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Rate Change   +1000.4% (2.4)%-1001(2.5)% (0.9)%1 Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.Market Risk from Trading ActivitiesUnder established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets, and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio. Our VAR calculation measures the potential trading losses using a one day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. This means that, on average, trading losses are expected to exceed VAR one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times per year. We had no backtest exceptions to our overall firmwide VAR during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. The following table presents high, low, and average VAR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. Value at Risk Profile      Table 18 For the Three Months Ended September 30 For the Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 2012 2011Average VAR$5 $5 $5 $5High VAR$5 $6 $5 $7Low VAR$4 $4 $4 $4Average VAR during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, was unchanged compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. While VAR can be a useful risk management tool, it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance. As such, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk. Specifically, scenario analysis, stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits are among other tools also used to actively manage trading risk.Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, averaged $4.6 billion and 4.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $4.6 billion and $3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, were $4.9 billion and $4.6 billion at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in net trading assets was primarily attributable to an increase in the TRS portfolio.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For 113example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments.The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a store of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. As of September 30, 2012, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $11.4 billion of free and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately 93% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital service) for an extended period of months in accordance with our risk limits.We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. The following table presents period-end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. We believe these contingent liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs.Contingent Liquidity Sources   Table 19 September 30, 2012 September 30, 2011(Dollars in billions)As of  Average for theNine Months Ended ¹  As of  Average for theNine Months Ended ¹ Excess reserves$1.8 $1.8 $1.7 $3.0Free and liquid investment portfolio securities11.4 13.5 15.7 17.7FHLB borrowing capacity12.1 11.3 15.2 13.0Discount window borrowing capacity17.7 17.0 15.0 13.7Total$43.0 $43.6 $47.6 $47.41Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. As of September 30, 2012, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. In the absence of robust loan demand, we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to retire certain high-cost debt securities or other borrowings. During the quarter, we used cash on hand to retire $1.2 billion of high-cost, fixed-rate trust preferred securities including SunTrust Capital VIII (6.10%) and SunTrust Capital IX (7.875%); we called these securities in June pursuant to a change in regulatory capital treatment for trust preferred securities as part of new capital rules announced by the Federal Reserve in June. The Parent Company retains a material cash position, in accordance with our policies and risk limits discussed in greater detail below.Contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. As of September 30, 2012, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, and DBRS all maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the “Stable” credit rating outlooks. 114Debt Credit Ratings and Outlook      Table 20 As of September 30, 2012 Moody’s  S&P  Fitch  DBRS SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits, originate primarily from our retail branch network and are our largest, most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits decreased to $124.9 billion as of September 30, 2012, from $125.6 billion as of December 31, 2011.We also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding decreased to $17.3 billion as of September 30, 2012, from $17.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. FHLB advances accounted for part of that decline as we retired $1 billion of advances during the three months ended September 30, 2012. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits, as well as Fed funds purchased, remained unchanged at $5.1 billion as of September 30, 2012, compared to December 31, 2011.As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5 billion of such securities, of which approximately $2.1 billion of issuance capacity remains available. On November 1, 2011, we issued $750 million of 3.50% senior Parent Company notes due January 20, 2017 and throughout 2012 we have issued several small structured notes for the Parent Company in the amount of $73 million. The Bank also maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of September 30, 2012, the Bank had $36.6 billion of remaining capacity to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, or formal program capacity, and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector.Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. As of September 30, 2012, this measure was well in excess of the current limit. Our Board Risk Committee regularly reviews this measure and other risk metrics. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. During the three months ended September 30, 2012, no Parent Company debt matured, and approximately $437 million of Parent Company debt is scheduled to mature during the fourth quarter of 2012. As mentioned above, we redeemed approximately $1.2 billion of trust preferred securities at the Parent Company that will not receive Tier 1 Capital credit under new regulatory capital rules; the Parent Company used cash on hand to redeem these securities. A majority of the Parent Company’s remaining liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances.Recent Developments. During the third quarter we executed and announced several balance sheet restructuring transactions that included the early termination of agreements related to our shares of Coke common stock and the planned sale of certain consumer and commercial loan portfolios. After selling the Coke shares, repurchasing the notes issued as part of the 2008 transaction, and 115paying taxes on the gains generated by the share sale, the net liquidity impact for the Bank and the Parent Company associated with the early termination of the Coke share agreements was immaterial. The Bank, however, anticipates receiving material proceeds from the sale of the aforementioned loan portfolios during the fourth quarter.Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective, the potential impact of which cannot be presently quantified. However, we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and prudent liquidity management practices.On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve published proposed measures to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms, pursuant to sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These proposed regulations include a number of requirements related to liquidity that would be instituted in phases. The first phase encompasses largely qualitative liquidity risk management practices, including internal liquidity stress testing. The second phase would include certain quantitative liquidity requirements related to the proposed Basel III liquidity standards. We believe that we will be well positioned to demonstrate compliance with these new requirements and standards if and when they are adopted.Other Liquidity Considerations. As presented in Table 21, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $63.8 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at September 30, 2012. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $4.1 billion in letters of credit as of September 30, 2012, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $2.2 billion of these letters supported variable rate demand obligations as of September 30, 2012.Unfunded Lending Commitments  Table 21(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Unused lines of credit:   Commercial$37,086 $35,685 Mortgage commitments 19,593 7,833Home equity lines11,964 12,730Commercial real estate1,232 1,465CP conduit— 765Credit card3,888 3,526Total unused lines of credit$63,763 $62,004Letters of credit:   Financial standby$4,051 $5,081Performance standby49 70Commercial43 55Total letters of credit$4,143 $5,2061Includes IRLC contracts with notional balances of $7.0 billion and $4.9 billion as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.Other Market RiskExcept as discussed below, there have been no other significant changes to other market risk as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. MSRs, which are carried at fair value, totaled $831 million and $921 million as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes. We recorded decreases of $116 million and $330 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively, and decreases of $437 million and $582 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. Increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows. We originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $83 million and $244 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively, and $47 million and $183 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, we recorded losses related to MSRs of $19 million and $36 million (including decay of $61 million and $173 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark-to-market adjustments on the related hedges. 116For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, we recorded losses related to MSRs of $40 million and $94 million (including decay of $46 million and $139 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark-to-market adjustments on the related hedges.We continue to monitor our holdings of foreign debt, securities, and commitments to lend to foreign countries and corporations, both funded and unfunded. Specifically, the risk is higher for exposure to countries that are experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. At September 30, 2012, we identified five countries in Europe that we believe are experiencing strains such that the likelihood of default is higher than would be anticipated if current economic, fiscal, and political strains were not present. The countries we identified were Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and were chosen based on the economic situation experienced in these countries during 2011, the first nine months of 2012, and continuing to exist as of September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2012, we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries. However, at September 30, 2012, we had direct exposure to corporations and individuals in these countries of $60 million that comprised of unfunded commitments to lend, funded loans, and a nominal amount of letters of credit. Indirect exposure to these countries was $37 million at September 30, 2012 and consisted primarily of double default risk exposure. The majority of the exposure is the notional amount of letters of credit issued on behalf of our role as an agent bank under the terms of a syndicated corporate loan agreement, wherein other participant banks in the syndicate are located in the identified higher risk countries. Overall, gross exposure to these countries continues to be less than 1% of our total assets as of September 30, 2012, consistent with our exposure at December 31, 2011.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSSee discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 6, “Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities,” and Note 11, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTSIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. As of September 30, 2012, time deposits declined by 14% during the year due to the maturity of a large population of higher-cost CDs. Except for this change noted in time deposits and the changes noted within the “Borrowings" section of this MD&A, there have been no other material changes in our Contractual Commitments as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.BUSINESS SEGMENTSThe following table presents net income/(loss) for our reportable business segments:Net Income/(Loss) by Segment      Table 22 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 2012 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management$50 $62 $218 $157Wholesale Banking145 68 486 249Mortgage Banking(388) (138) (639) (451)Corporate Other1,265 149 1,450 394The following table presents average loans and average deposits for our reportable business segments: Average Loans and Deposits by Segment      Table 23 Three Months Ended September 30 Average Loans Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 2012 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management$41,574 $38,887 $76,185 $76,618Wholesale Banking51,990 47,996 45,291 43,193Mortgage Banking30,467 28,765 3,938 3,081Corporate Other49 (10) (61) 82117 Nine Months Ended September 30 Average Loans Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 2012 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management$41,493 $38,793 $76,774 $76,466Wholesale Banking51,115 47,490 45,356 42,348Mortgage Banking30,690 28,966 3,571 2,920Corporate Other34 (7) (9) 129See Note 14, “Business Segment Reporting,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for discussion of our segment structure, basis of presentation, and internal management reporting methodologies.BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTSNine Months Ended September 30, 2012 vs. 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth ManagementConsumer Banking and Private Wealth Management reported net income of $218 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, an increase of $61 million, or 39%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in net income was due to lower provision for credit losses, lower expenses, and higher net interest income, partially offset by lower noninterest income. Net interest income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $36 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was driven by higher average loan and deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of lower loan and deposit spreads. Net interest income related to loans increased $32 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year driven by a $2.7 billion, or 7%, increase in average loan balances, partially offset by a decrease in loan spreads of 7 basis points. The increase in average loans was driven by higher production in indirect auto, consumer direct, and the fourth quarter of 2011 acquisitions of student loan portfolios, partially offset by decreases in home equity lines and residential mortgages. Other funding costs related to other assets and other liabilities improved by $17 million driven primarily by a decline in funding rates. Pursuant to the asset dispositions announced in September 2012, $1.4 billion in guaranteed student loan balances were transferred to loans held for sale in the third quarter, resulting in the recognition of a $15 million loss on the transfer. The sales are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Approximately $1.0 billion in sales was completed in October 2012 with the remaining $400 million expected to be sold during the fourth quarter. Further, we expect to transfer approximately $600 million of additional guaranteed student loans to held for sale in the fourth quarter, with an immaterial gain or loss associated with the transfer.Net interest income related to client deposits decreased $13 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2011 as deposit spreads decreased 3 basis points, partially offset by a $308 million increase in average client deposit balances. Favorable deposit mix trends continued as low cost average deposits increased $2.8 billion, or 5%, offsetting a $2.5 billion, or 15%, decline in higher cost average time deposits. Provision for credit losses was $435 million, a decrease of $125 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was driven by declines in net charge-offs of: $65 million in home equity lines, $14 million in residential mortgage loans, $14 million in credit card, $14 million in consumer indirect, and $12 million in commercial. Additionally, the third quarter of 2012 included $43 million of incremental charge-offs related to a change in credit policy accelerating the charge-off of second lien loans from 180 days to 120 days past due.Total noninterest income was $971 million, a decrease of $138 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2011. Card fees decreased $124 million compared to the same period in 2011 driven by regulations on debit interchange fee income that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. Additionally, $15 million in a market valuation write-down related to the transfer of student loans to held for sale and a modest decline in trust and investment management income were partially offset by higher retail investment income. Total noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, a decline of $73 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was driven by reduced staff expense as a result of a 7% decrease in FTE caused by efficiency initiatives related to branch staffing models. Additionally, the decrease in noninterest expense was driven by decreases in other real estate expense and the reclassification of card rewards program costs to card fees within noninterest income in the third quarter of 2012.118Wholesale BankingWholesale Banking reported net income of $486 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, an increase of $237 million, or 95%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in net income was attributable to decreases in provision for credit losses combined with an increase in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by a slight increase in noninterest expense.Net interest income was $1.4 billion, a $111 million, or 9%, increase from the prior year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances. Net interest income related to loans increased $61 million, or 8%, as average loan balances increased $3.6 billion, or 8%, with increases in commercial and tax-exempt loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans. Net interest income related to deposits increased $32 million, or 6%, resulting from a $3.0 billion, or 7%, increase in client deposit balances. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as lower cost demand deposits increased $4.6 billion, or 24%, while average combined interest-bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, reflecting a continued shift in customer preference towards demand deposit products. Provision for credit losses was $246 million, a decrease of $242 million, or 50%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower core net charge-offs in commercial real estate and commercial loans, partially offset by an increase in charge-offs related to commercial real estate NPLs that were transferred to held for sale during the third quarter.Total noninterest income was $1.2 billion, an increase of $54 million, or 5%, from the prior year, predominantly driven by increased trading revenue largely driven by fixed income revenue, leasing gains and non margin loan fees. These increases were partially offset by declines in card services revenue due to lower rates driven by regulations that became effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, letter of credit fees, and service charges on deposit accounts.Total noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Noninterest expense included impairment charges of $96 million related to planned affordable housing partnership interests dispositions, announced in September 2012. Sales of the partnership investments are expected to be completed in 2013. Partially offsetting the impairment charges were the favorable settlement of litigation claims and continued declines in other real estate related expense, staff expense and allocated corporate costs. Mortgage BankingMortgage Banking reported a net loss of $639 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, a $188 million, or 42% increase, over the net loss of $451 million for the same period in 2011. The higher loss was primarily driven by strategic actions taken in the third quarter and higher expenses. The actions taken included additional loan repurchase provision expected to be sufficient to cover pre-2009 GSE demands, higher provision for loan losses associated with charge-offs on the sale of $447 million of nonperforming loans, as well as market valuation losses related to the transfer of $500 million of GNMA loans to held for sale. These income reductions were partially offset by higher net interest income, strong mortgage production, and higher gain on sale margins.Net interest income was $388 million, an increase of $40 million, or 11%. The increase was predominantly due to higher net interest income on loans and LHFS and reduced funding costs on lower MSR balances, partially offset by lower deposit income. Residential mortgage loans increased $2.0 billion, or 8%, resulting in an increase in net interest income of $20 million. Net interest income on LHFS increased $10 million due to an $830 million increase in average balances partially offset by lower loan spreads. Net interest income increased $15 million, or 54%, due to lower funding costs of average MSRs. Total average deposits increased $651 million, or 22%, with net interest income decreasing $7 million due predominantly to lower deposit spreads.Provision for credit losses was $602 million, an increase of $82 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2011 due to an $89 million increase in residential mortgage net charge-offs. Core charge-offs declined, however, the increase in total provision was primarily due to $171 million in charge-offs related to the sale of nonperforming residential mortgage loans in both second and third quarters of 2012. This compares with $10 million related to nonperforming loan sales in 2011. Additionally, the third quarter of 2012 included $22 million of incremental charge-offs related to a change in credit policy accelerating the charge-off of second lien loans from 180 days to 120 days past due.Total noninterest income was $261 million, a decline of $10 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decline was predominantly driven by a $415 million increase in mortgage repurchase provision as a result of a $371 million provision in the third quarter of 2012 that is expected to cover estimated incurred losses on pre-2009 GSE demands. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2012, a $77 million write-down was recorded associated primarily with the transfer of approximately $500 million of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans to LHFS. The repurchase provision and write-downs were partially offset by gains on loan sales and 119fee income due to higher production volume. Loan originations were $24 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $16.2 billion for the prior year, an increase of $7.8 billion, or 48%. Mortgage servicing income was $211 million, an increase of $9 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2011. Total loans serviced were $150 billion at September 30, 2012 compared with $161 billion at September 30, 2011, down 7%.Total noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, an increase of $216 million, or 26%, compared to the same period in 2011. The higher expenses were attributable to a $99 million increase in operating losses due to compliance-related costs, largely associated with mortgage servicing and litigation expenses. Additionally, consulting expenses increased $41 million, predominantly due to costs associated with the Federal Reserve Consent Order and other business initiatives. Total allocated costs increased $51 million and staff expenses increased $39 million driven by costs associated with higher production volumes.Corporate OtherCorporate Other's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $1.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was predominantly due to securities gains derived from the sale of stock in The Coca-Cola Company, partially offset by lower interest income as a result of maturing interest rate swaps utilized to manage interest rate risk, lower gains from the sale of other AFS securities, and a higher charitable contributions expense.Net interest income was $303 million, a decrease of $69 million, or 19%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower income from the aforementioned interest swaps and the foregone dividend income resulting from the sale of the stock in The Coca-Cola Company, and was partially offset by lower cost of funds driven by a decrease in other assets. Total average assets decreased $2.0 billion, or 6%, predominantly due to reduction in the investment portfolio. Average long-term debt decreased by $1.5 billion, or 12%, compared to 2011, primarily due to the repayment of senior and subordinated debt. Average short-term borrowings increased $6.7 billion as our non-deposit funding profile began to reflect a more normalized asset growth and balance sheet environment.Total noninterest income was $2.0 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was predominantly due to a $1.9 billion net gain on sale of stock in The Coca-Cola Company. These gains were partially offset by a $140 million decrease in mark-to-market valuation on our public debt and index linked CDs carried at fair value and a $63 million decrease in net gains on the sale of AFS securities.Total noninterest expenses increased $85 million compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was mainly due to a $38 million charitable contribution of the stock in The Coca-Cola Company to the SunTrust Foundation, increased staff expenses primarily associated with improved business performance, higher severance expense, lease abandonment charges related to office space utilization plan changes and increased debt extinguishment charges in 2012 related to redemption of higher cost trust preferred securities.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresThe Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2012. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2012.
