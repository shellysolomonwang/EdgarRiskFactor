Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThe risks described in this report and in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial, also may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or future results. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors," in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, or future results, should be carefully considered. Additionally, we update the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K by adding the following risk factor:Interest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments.LIBOR and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates. We also update the "Risk Factors" section contained in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K by replacing the existing risk factor, “A failure in, or breach of, our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber- attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses,” with the following two risk factors:Our operational systems and infrastructure may fail or may be the subject of a breach or cyber-attack that could adversely affect our business.We depend on our ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis. As client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns, whether as a result of human error or intentional attack. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in client transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; occurrences of employee error, fraud, or malfeasance; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our businesses and clients. Our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses.In particular, information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have substantially increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication, resources and activities of hackers, terrorists, activists, organized crime, and other external parties, including hostile nation state actors. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use devices or software that are beyond our control environment, which may provide additional avenues for bad actors to gain access to confidential information. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients' devices and software may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, change, or destruction of our or our clients' confidential, proprietary and other information (including personal identifying 104information of individuals), or otherwise disrupt our or our clients' or other third parties' business operations. Other U.S. financial institutions and financial service companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, including attempts to shut down access to their networks and systems in an attempt to extract compensation from them to regain control. Several financial institutions, including SunTrust, have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks, a sophisticated and targeted attack intended to disable or degrade internet service or to sabotage systems.Although we are not aware of any material breach of our networks, systems and data or material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to our networks, systems and data or to obtain, change or destroy confidential data (including personal identifying information of individuals) through a variety of means, including computer viruses, malware, and phishing. In the future, these attacks may result in unauthorized individuals obtaining access to our confidential information or that of our clients, or otherwise accessing, damaging, or disrupting our systems or infrastructure.We must continuously develop and enhance our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. This continued development and enhancement will require us to expend additional resources, including to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities that may be detected. Despite our investments in security measures, including employee training, we are unable to assure that any security measures that require action by employees may not be subject to human error.If our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged, or disrupted, or if we were to experience a loss of our confidential information or that of our clients, we could be subject to serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of trust in us on the part of our clients, vendors or other counterparties, client attrition, reimbursement or other  costs, increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability, or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or financial condition.A disruption, breach, or failure in the operational systems and infrastructure of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our business.Third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. In particular, operating our business requires us to provide access to client and other sensitive company information to our contractors, consultants, and other third parties and authorized entities. Controls and oversight mechanisms are in place to limit access to this information and protect it from unauthorized disclosure, theft, and disruption. However, control systems and policies pertaining to system access are subject to errors in design, oversight failure, software failure, human error, intentional subversion or other compromise resulting in theft, error, loss, or inappropriate use of information or systems to commit fraud, cause embarrassment to us or our executives or to gain competitive advantage. In addition, regulators expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of their performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. If a disruption, breach, or failure in the system or infrastructure of any third party with whom we do business occurred, our business may be materially and adversely affected in a manner similar to if our own systems or infrastructure had been compromised. Our systems and infrastructure may also be attacked, compromised, or damaged as a result of, or as the intended target of, any disruption, breach, or failure in the systems or infrastructure of any third party with whom we do business.105Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
