Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  Below we supplement the risk factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Such risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, and are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we have deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.  The Company added the following risk factor:  Federal bank regulatory agencies have directed us to increase our Tier 1 common equity as a result of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency completed a review, called the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, of the potential capital needs through the end of 2010 of the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve has advised us that based on the SCAP review, we presently have and are projected to continue to have Tier 1 capital well in excess of the amount required to be well capitalized through the forecast period under both the baseline scenario and the more adverse-than-expected scenario (“more adverse”) as prepared by the Department of the Treasury of the United States (the “U.S. Treasury”). The SCAP’s more adverse scenario represents a hypothetical scenario that involves a recession that is longer and more severe than consensus expectations and results in higher than expected credit losses, but is not a forecast of expected losses or revenues. The Federal Reserve has advised us that based on the more adverse scenario that we need to adjust the composition of our Tier 1 capital by increasing the Tier 1 common equity portion by $2.2 billion. The additional common equity is necessary to maintain Tier 1 common equity at 4% of risk weighted assets under the more adverse scenario, as specified by a new regulatory standard that was introduced as part of the stress test. This increase will ensure that we will have a sufficient mix of common equity as a percentage of Tier 1 capital if the more adverse scenario materializes. The Federal Reserve intends the additional common equity to serve as a buffer against higher losses than generally expected, and allow such bank holding companies to remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers should such losses materialize.  As a result, we intend to adjust the composition of our Tier 1 capital by increasing the portion that is composed of Tier 1 common equity. Alternatives include both internally and externally generated capital to increase the common equity level. We presently believe that we will be able to comply with this newly introduced regulatory capital standard using internal and non-governmental sources of capital, while reducing the existing government preferred equity, subject to regulatory approval. However, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in increasing the portion of our Tier 1 capital that is composed of Tier 1 common equity. Further, if we are not able to raise additional common equity either internally or externally, via the private or public markets, we may be required to apply to the U.S. Treasury to replace the preferred shares issued pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program (the “CPP”) with mandatory convertible preferred shares. Mandatory convertible preferred shares provide us the option to convert the preferred shares into common shares within seven years, if necessary. If the mandatory convertible preferred shares are converted, the U.S. Treasury may become a significant holder of our common shares. Changes to our capital composition may dilute or otherwise adversely affect existing security holders. In addition, if we replace the CPP preferred shares with mandatory convertible preferred shares, we may become subject to additional or more restrictive corporate governance and executive compensation regulations.
