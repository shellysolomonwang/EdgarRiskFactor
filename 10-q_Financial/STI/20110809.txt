Risk Factors” of this report, and also include those risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; concerns over market volatility continue; the Dodd-Frank Act makes fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry, some of which may adversely affect our business; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; emergency measures designed to stabilize the U.S. banking system are beginning to wind down; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, our operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.    71    Table of Contents INTRODUCTION  This MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated).  We are one of the nation’s largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under six business segments: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CRE, CIB, Mortgage, and W&IM, with the remainder in Corporate Other and Treasury. In addition to traditional deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, credit-related insurance, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services.  The following analysis of our financial performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this document and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements and related information to conform them to the 2011 presentation. In the MD&A, net interest income and the net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE and annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided below in Table 1, Selected Quarterly Financial Data.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  Economic and regulatory  The economic recovery remained uneven during the quarter and uncertainty was evident as unemployment climbed and data surrounding job growth indicated an unexpected pullback in hiring and available jobs in recent months. Additionally, consumer spending declined during the quarter, consumer sentiment remained relatively low, and measures of inflation increased, due in part to higher commodity prices. The U.S. housing market continued to be weak due to the inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties, weak demand, and home prices remaining under pressure. Amidst the uncertain economic conditions, the Federal Reserve indicated that key interest rates will remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period and that they will continue to reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings. Further, the Federal Reserve maintained a forecast for stable longer-term inflation expectations, gradual economic recovery through 2011 and 2012, although at a slower pace than previously expected, and a slow decline in unemployment with elevated levels persisting through the end of 2012.  The regulatory agencies have taken actions on a considerable amount of rules and regulations during the second quarter, as we marked the one year anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act in July. The Federal Reserve finalized rules during the quarter that would allow the payment of interest on business demand deposits, which had been prohibited under Regulation Q. As a result, our product offerings have been expanded to include business demand deposits that pay interest; however, we do not believe the impact will be material to our financial results. The Federal Reserve also issued a final rule on debit card interchange fees that will limit the amount of interchange fee income that can be received for electronic debit transactions. This rule will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, and we currently believe the impact of this rule may decrease our annual interchange revenue by as much as 50% before any mitigating actions that we may take to offset the impact. See additional discussion of the new interchange rules and their impact on our income in the “Noninterest Income” section of this MD&A. New FDIC rules related to the calculation of our deposit insurance assessment became effective on April 1, 2011 and require us to base our deposit insurance assessment calculation on our total average assets less average tangible equity, rather than domestic deposits. In addition, the FDIC revised the overall pricing structure for large banks, which results in assessment rates being affected by specific risk characteristics, such as asset concentrations, liquidity, and asset quality. These changes by the FDIC caused a modest increase in our regulatory assessments during the quarter. In addition, the work required in complying with the Federal Reserve’s Consent Order that was issued in April is continuing and we remain on schedule. We currently do not expect that complying with the Consent Order will have a material effect on our financial results. We are actively evaluating other proposed rules and regulations, and as they emerge from the various stages of implementation and promulgation, we will be in a position to comply with new requirements and take appropriate actions as warranted.    72    Table of Contents Capital  During the first quarter, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR for the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. Upon completion of their review, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted. As a result of the CCAR completion, we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan, including public offerings of $1.0 billion of common stock and $1.0 billion of senior debt. In addition, we used the proceeds from those offerings, as well as other available funds, to repurchase $3.5 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C and $1.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP’s CPP in November and December 2008. The repurchase of the preferred stock will eliminate approximately $265 million in annual preferred dividend payments and discount accretion that has been negatively affecting our earnings the past two years. In addition, by keeping our shareholders’ best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient and deliberate approach to TARP repayment, we believe that we successfully lessened the impact to our shareholders by issuing less common stock than what would have been required had we chosen to repay TARP earlier.  Our capital remained strong at June 30, 2011, and the level of common equity was significantly bolstered as a result of the successful common equity raise in the first quarter of 2011. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 9.22% compared to 8.08% at December 31, 2010. Meanwhile, as a result of the change in our equity mix due to the repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, our Tier 1 capital ratio declined to 11.11%, compared to 13.67% at December 31, 2010, but increased compared to 11.00% at March 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 capital ratio, excluding TARP, was 10.08%. Our total capital ratio at June 30 was 14.01% compared to 16.54% at December 31, 2010 and 13.92% at March 31, 2011. Overall, our capital remains well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards. With strong capital, ample liquidity, and improved earnings, we believe that we are well-positioned for long-term growth. At the same time, we recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders and on August 9, 2011, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share, payable on September 15, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 1, 2011. See additional discussion of our liquidity and capital position in the “Liquidity Risk” and “Capital Resources” sections of this MD&A.  Financial performance  Our EPS continued to improve during the second quarter, and we continued to build on the positive momentum created in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. Our continued focus on serving our clients and managing our core business to drive improved bottom line results, together with improved credit quality, resulted in net income available to common shareholders during the current quarter of $174 million, or $0.33 per average common diluted share, which compares favorably to the net loss available to common shareholders of $56 million, or $0.11 per average common share, during the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 results were improved over the same period in 2010 due primarily to a lower credit loss provision, higher net interest income, and the absence of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury. Net income available to common shareholders also improved compared to the first quarter’s results of $38 million. The current quarter’s results, when compared to the prior quarter, were driven by a lower credit loss provision, higher noninterest income, the absence of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury, and a one-time non-cash charge of $74 million related to the accelerated accretion associated with the repurchase of the preferred stock in March 2011, offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $212 million compared to a loss of $285 million during the same period in 2010. The improvement during the six month period is primarily related to a reduced credit losses provision, higher total revenue, and less preferred dividend payments. During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011, the decreases in our provision for credit losses compared to the same periods in the prior year were 41% and 45%, respectively, and were a significant driver of the increase in our net income available to common shareholders. As credit quality continues to improve, the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods. As we look towards the future, we continue to invest in teammate engagement, client loyalty, and growth in primary relationships that we believe will drive market share growth and, ultimately, higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders.    73    Table of Contents Asset quality improvement was broad-based and continued a multi-quarter trend with improvements in the provision for loan losses, net charge-offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets, and early stage delinquencies. At June 30, 2011, the ALLL remains elevated by historical standards at 2.40% of total loans but declined 18 basis points compared to December 31, 2010, in part due to a $230 million decrease in the ALLL, and declined by 9 basis points since the first quarter of 2011. The improvement in credit quality drove a 12%, 22%, and 44% decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to the first quarter of 2011, the fourth quarter of 2010, and the second quarter of 2010, respectively. In addition, net charge-offs declined 12%, 19%, and 30% compared to the first quarter of 2011, the fourth quarter of 2010, and the second quarter of 2010. We currently expect net charge-offs to trend down over time, however, we believe third quarter net charge-offs will approximate second quarter net charge-offs. Total NPLs continued the downward trend seen during 2010 with a decline of 12% from December 31, 2010 as a result of reduced inflows into nonaccrual and our problem loan resolution efforts. NPLs are also down 9% compared to the first quarter of 2011. We expect NPLs to continue to decline during the remainder of 2011 subject to economic conditions and credit quality trends remaining stable or improving. In addition, OREO declined 10% during the quarter and 19% since year end, as we continued to opportunistically dispose of properties once we had clear title. Our accruing restructured loan portfolio, which is primarily mortgage and consumer loans, increased by 4% compared to December 31, 2010. However, the portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 86% current on principal and interest payments at both June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Nonperforming Assets,” and “Restructured Loans,” sections of this MD&A.  Average loans remained flat during the quarter compared to both the first quarter of 2011 and to the fourth quarter of 2010, with decreases in certain commercial real estate, commercial construction, and residential real estate categories being offset by increases in commercial & industrial and consumer loans. Even though the total average loan balances have remained flat, our risk profile continues to improve as a result of the decline in certain higher-risk loan portfolios, which have been offset by targeted growth in certain lower-risk portfolios, such that higher-risk loans comprised less than 10% of our entire loan portfolio and lower-risk government guaranteed loans represented 8% of the portfolio as of June 30, 2011. Despite continued soft loan demand, we remain focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers during this uncertain economic landscape. To that end, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, we extended approximately $36.8 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients.  Client deposit growth continued its positive trajectory, reaching a record high in the second quarter, and the positive shift in deposit mix continued with lower-cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher-cost deposits. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% during the second quarter and 2% since the fourth quarter of 2010. Average balance increases were driven by increases in lower cost noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market accounts, partially offset by declines in higher cost CDs. Due to the growth seen in core deposits, our liquidity has been enhanced, enabling us to reduce our higher-cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our funding costs and improvement in net interest margin. While we continue to believe that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients’ desires for having increased liquidity, we believe that we’ve also proactively driven this growth in both our Consumer and Wholesale business, as we’ve expanded the number of primary client relationships and improved our client loyalty.  Our client-focused revenue generation strategies, lower cost funding mix, and improved asset quality contributed to improved operating trends as seen in higher net interest income and margin and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses compared to a year ago. Total revenue, on an FTE basis, remained relatively unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2010 and increased 7% for the first six months of 2011, in comparison to the first six months of 2010, due to stable earning assets, increases in certain fee based revenue, and an expanded net interest margin. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, increased 6%, in the first half of 2011. The increase in net interest income compared to the prior year was due to lower funding costs, improved funding mix, and a reduction in long-term debt. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.53% for the three months ended June 30, 2011 from 3.33% during the same period in 2010 and 3.53% compared to 3.32% for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. Noninterest income declined 4% compared to the same quarter in 2010, most notably due to decreases in trading income, securities gains, and lower service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by higher investment banking income, card fees, and mortgage production income. Compared to the first six months of 2010, noninterest income was up 9% in 2011 due to increases across most categories of income, but primarily driven by higher investment banking income and mortgage production income, partially offset by a decline in deposit account service change income primarily as a result of the Regulation E impact in the current periods compared to the prior year when Regulation E changes were yet to be effective. Noninterest expense increased 3% during the current quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2010, driven primarily by higher personnel costs, operating losses, and regulatory costs, partially offset by gains on debt extinguishment. Compared to the first six months of 2010, noninterest expense increased by 5% during 2011, primarily due to the same factors as the three month periods. The higher personnel costs are due to an increase in compensation as a result of improved revenue generation in certain businesses, as well as the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in loss mitigation and in client service and support roles. The increase in the operating losses was due to increases in legal and compliance related accruals, and regulatory cost increases were due to the change in the FDIC assessment methodology. See additional discussion of our financial performance in the “Consolidated Financial Results” section of this MD&A.    74    Table of Contents Overall, we had some encouraging signs during the quarter with progress being made, but our performance is not where we would like for it to be, and therefore we have specific initiatives aimed at improving our performance in the future. Some of these efforts are designed to further improve our revenue generation while others are intended to lower our expense base. To lower expenses, a key focus will be on implementing an aggressive approach to shared services wherein we will centralize and eliminate redundancy of similar functions currently contained in multiple parts of the organization. This will allow us to more effectively balance cost, quality, and service to more efficiently meet the needs of our lines of business, geographies, and support functions. We have initiatives underway to identify enterprise-wide solutions in such disciplines as technology and operations, finance, procurement, marketing, and human resources to maximize the impact of our investments there. In addition to the shared services assessment, our supplier management efforts will be intensified to yield greater cost savings, and plans to reduce paper usage both within the organization and in our interaction with clients will be accelerated. We also will move toward more technology-driven self-service channels, such as a more robust ATM network and enhanced mobile banking platforms, that increase convenience for clients while driving down delivery costs and enabling improved efficiencies of our branch network. As a result of these initiatives, we are targeting $300 million in annual expense savings, with a majority of the actions to be accomplished during 2012 and the remainder in 2013.    75    Table of Contents       Selected Quarterly Financial Data   Table 1                          Three Months EndedJune 30     Six Months EndedJune 30    (Dollars in millions, except per share data)    2011       2010       2011       2010      Summary of Operations                       Interest income     $1,546        $1,570        $3,100        $3,144      Interest expense     287        392        592        794                                                Net interest income     1,259        1,178        2,508        2,350      Provision for credit losses     392        662        839        1,524                                                Net interest income after provision for credit losses     867        516        1,669        826      Noninterest income     912        952        1,795        1,650      Noninterest expense     1,542        1,503        3,007        2,864                                                Net income/(loss) before provision/(benefit) for income taxes     237        (35)       457        (388)     Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest     1        3        8        5      Provision/(benefit) for income taxes     58        (50)       91        (244)                                               Net income/(loss)     $178        $12        $358        ($149)                                               Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders     $174        ($56)       $212        ($285)                                               Net interest income -

We believe noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.  2For EPS calculation purposes, the impact of dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted share count during periods in which we recognize a net loss available to common shareholders because the impact would be antidilutive.  3We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.  4Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.  5We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.  6We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.    77    Table of Contents       Net Interest Margin   Table 2                                            Three Months Ended     Increase/(Decrease) From        June 30, 2011     June 30, 2010     Prior Year Quarter    (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable-equivalent basis)    Average  Balances       Income/  Expense       Yields/  Rates       Average  Balances       Income/  Expense       Yields/  Rates       Average  Balances       Yields/Rates      Assets                                           Loans:1                                            Real estate residential mortgage 1-4 family     $28,971        $357        4.93   %      $28,638        $393        5.49   %      $333        (0.56)  %     Real estate construction     2,167        21        3.90        3,274        30        3.67        (1,107)       0.23       Real estate home equity lines     14,347        121        3.37        14,973        126        3.37        (626)       -

Income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis.  2Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $27 million and $30 million for the three month periods ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively.  3Accruing TDRs were classified in nonaccruals during prior periods. Due to sustained performance, accruing TDRs have been reclassified to the applicable loans category where the related interest income is being classified for all periods presented.  4We obtained derivative instruments to manage our interest-sensitivity position that increased net interest income $157 million and $148 million for the three month periods ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively.  5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.    78    Table of Contents                                               Six Months Ended         Increase/(Decrease) FromPrior Year            June 30, 2011         June 30, 2010              (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable-equivalent basis)   AverageBalances      Income/ Expense      Yields/ Rates         AverageBalances      Income/ Expense      Yields/ Rates         Average Balances       Yields/ Rates         Assets                                                    Loans:1                                                     Real estate 1-4 family     $29,198        $726        4.97     %     $28,587        $790        5.53      %     $611        (0.56)     %    Real estate construction     2,326        45        3.92          3,674        64        3.54           (1,348)       0.38          Real estate home equity lines     14,459        242        3.37          15,064        250        3.35           (605)       0.02          Real estate commercial     13,334        268        4.06          15,098        305        4.07           (1,764)       (0.01)         Commercial -

Income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis.  2Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $54 million and $61 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively.  3Accruing TDRs were classified in nonaccruals during prior periods. Due to sustained performance, accruing TDRs have been reclassified to the applicable loans category where the related interest income is being classified for all periods presented.  4We obtained derivative instruments to manage our interest-sensitivity position that increased net interest income $312 million and $304 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, respectively.  5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.    79    Table of Contents Net Interest Income/Margin  Second Quarter of 2011  Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $78 million, or 6%, from the second quarter of 2010. This increase was driven mainly by a continued positive trend in net interest margin, which increased 20 basis points to 3.53% in the second quarter of 2011 from 3.33% in the second quarter of 2010. Earning asset yields declined 9 basis points compared to second quarter 2010, but the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 34 basis points over the same period. The biggest contributors to the increase in net interest margin were the growth in lower-cost deposits, specifically demand deposit and money market accounts, while higher-cost time deposits and long-term debt declined. We currently expect the net interest margin to modestly decline in the third quarter of 2011 due primarily to continued decreases in interest earning asset yields, given the low rate environment.  Average earning assets increased $521 million, or less than 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2010. Average loans increased $1.9 billion, or 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2010. The increase in loans was primarily attributable to increases of $2.7 billion, or 8%, in commercial loans, $2.5 billion, or 36%, in consumer-indirect loans, driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios, and $1.3 billion, or 23%, in higher yielding consumer-direct loans related to an increase in government-guaranteed student loans. These increases were partially offset by declines of $1.9 billion, or 13%, in commercial real estate and $1.1 billion, or 34%, in real estate construction, both primarily as a result of our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these loans, and a $1.2 billion, or 24%, decline in nonaccrual loans. LHFS declined $1.2 billion, or 37%, as a result of a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume, as higher mortgage interest rates affected loan demand. Average securities AFS decreased $615 million, or 2%, due primarily to the sale of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities of $4.6 billion and almost entirely offset by purchases of agency MBS and federal agency securities. See additional discussion in the “Securities Available for Sale” section included in this MD&A for more information on the repositioning of our securities AFS portfolio. Average interest earning trading assets increased $404 million, or 13%, in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010, but the additional assets’ yields were lower compared to the assets replaced from the prior year as a result of a change in market spreads.  Our loan portfolio yielded 4.62% for the second quarter, down 15 basis points from second quarter 2010. The yield decline was primarily related to real estate 1-4 family, which was driven by run-off of higher rate loans being replaced with lower rate government guaranteed loans and an increase in the consumer-indirect loan portfolio that included the addition of lower rate loans. Since a large percentage of our commercial loans are variable rate indexed to one month LIBOR, we utilize receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. As of June 30, 2011, the outstanding notional balance of swaps was $15.9 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared to $16.4 billion as of June 30, 2010. Swap income remained stable at $157 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to $148 million in the second quarter of 2010.  Average interest-bearing liabilities declined $2.2 billion, or 2%, from the second quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of significant declines in long-term debt. Total average consumer and commercial deposits increased $5.4 billion, or 5%, in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. This growth consisted of lower-cost deposits, including $5.2 billion, or 14%, in money market accounts, and $4.3 billion, or 17%, in demand deposits, partially offset by a decline of $4.3 billion, or 18%, in higher-cost time deposits. This growth in lower-cost deposits was the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing and clients’ increased preference for more liquid products. The overall growth in consumer and commercial deposits allowed for a reduction in other higher-cost funding sources, including $2.8 billion of long-term debt. The growth in lower-cost deposits and decline in higher-cost deposits and wholesale funding resulted in a 34 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  During the second quarter of 2011, the interest rate environment was characterized by lower long-term rates compared to short-term rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve versus the second quarter of 2010. More specifically, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25%, unchanged from second quarter 2010, the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, unchanged from second quarter 2010, one-month LIBOR averaged 0.20%, a decrease of 11 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.26%, a decrease of 18 basis points, five-year swaps averaged 2.07%, a decrease of 42 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 3.29%, a decrease of 22 basis points.  First Half of 2011  For the first six months of 2011, net interest income was $2.6 billion, an increase of $153 million, or 6%, from the first six months of 2010. Average earning assets increased $207 million, or less than 1%. The slight increase in earning assets was attributable to a $2.6 billion, or 39%, increase in consumer indirect loans, a $1.8 billion, or 5%, increase in commercial loans, and a $1.4 billion, or 26%, increase in consumer direct loans. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $1.8 billion, or 12%, in real estate commercial loans, $1.3 billion, or 37%, in real estate construction, $1.3 billion, or 25%, in average nonaccrual loans, and $1.0 billion, or 4%, in average securities AFS. The average balance decrease in the securities portfolio was primarily attributable to a $1.8 billion reduction in U.S. Treasury securities and federal agency securities.    80    Table of Contents Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $5.5 billion, or 5%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2011 compared to the six month period ended June 30, 2010. Increases of $5.8 billion, or 16%, in money market accounts, and $4.1 billion, or 16%, in demand deposits contributed to the growth in deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $4.5 billion, or 18%, in time deposits. As a result of our asset/liability management actions, long-term debt also decreased by $3.3 billion, or 19%, and brokered deposits decreased by $377 million, or 14%. Factors affecting the year-over-year changes were the same as those discussed related to the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2011.  Consistent with the positive trend previously discussed, the net interest margin increased by 21 basis points from the six months ended June 30, 2010 to the same period in 2011. Yields on average earning assets declined 7 basis points from 4.42% for the first six months ended June 30, 2010 to 4.35% for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The average yield on loans for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was 4.67%, down 10 basis points from the same period in 2010. The factors in the year-over-year decrease were the same as those discussed related to the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2011. Partially offsetting the decline in the average yield on loans, was the average yield on LHFS which increased 12 basis points to 4.15%, and the average yield on securities AFS which increased 8 basis points to 3.29%. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities over the same period decreased 33 basis points, due primarily to the 29 basis point decline in consumer and commercial deposits, which resulted from the declining interest rate environment and the change in deposit mix.  Foregone Interest  Foregone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by 16 basis points for the second quarter of 2011 and 17 basis points for the first six months of 2011, compared to 22 basis points and 23 basis points during the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, as average nonaccrual loans decreased $1.2 billion, or 24%, and $1.3 billion, or 25%, during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.  Noninterest Income  Noninterest income decreased by $40 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, due to lower net gains on the sale of investment securities, lower service charges on deposit accounts, and lower trading account profits and commissions, partially offset by growth in certain consumer and commercial fee categories, including investment banking income, retail investment services income, and card fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, noninterest income increased by $145 million, or 9%, as strong investment banking results, improved mortgage production related results, and higher gains on the sale of investment securities were offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts.  Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $38 million, or 18%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $71 million, or 18%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The decreases were attributable to Regulation E changes and a voluntary decision to eliminate fees on transactions where the overdrafted amount is small, as well as reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees charged to our clients. The voluntary changes and the Regulation E impact began during the third quarter of 2010.    81    Table of Contents  Card fees increased by $11 million, or 12%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $24 million, or 13%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were primarily due to an increase in debit card interchange transactions. Growth was driven by household expansion, higher product penetration, and increasing consumer usage patterns. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing revised standards that significantly lowered the rates that can be charged on debit card transactions and prohibited network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. Currently, our debit card interchange fee revenue is approximately $370 million on an annualized basis. We estimate that this rule, when it becomes effective in the fourth quarter, will impact our debit interchange income by about 50% prior to any mitigating actions. As a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue, we have introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients’ needs and which we expect will provide additional streams of fee income. Additionally, we will also benefit from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs and plan to add other value-added checking account features that, over time, we expect will produce additional deposit fee income. Collectively, and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all of these changes will enable us to recapture approximately 50% of the revenue loss attributable to both the newly-issued interchange fee rules and Regulation E.  Trust and investment management income increased by $8 million, or 6%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $21 million, or 8%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were primarily due to higher market valuations on managed equity assets partially offset by lower money market mutual fund revenue.  Retail investment services income increased by $11 million, or 23%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $22 million, or 23%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were driven by higher recurring brokerage revenue and annuity income.  Mortgage production related income improved by $20 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010 and by $50 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The improvements were primarily due to a decline in the mortgage repurchase provision, partially offset by lower loan production. Reserves for mortgage repurchases were $299 million as of June 30, 2011, an increase of $34 million compared to December 31, 2010. The increase in the reserve was related to an increase in repurchase requests during both the first and second quarters of the year. The increases have been driven primarily by increased agency requests related to the 2007 vintage loans. Repurchase requests can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of requests from the GSEs. While demands will likely continue to be volatile on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we continue to believe that demands from the higher loss 2006 and 2007 vintages will decline as normal seasoning patterns occur.  Mortgage servicing related income decreased by $16 million, or 18%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $14 million, or 9%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The decreases for the three months were primarily due to a decrease in MSR mark to market adjustments, net of hedging gains and losses. The decreases for the six months were primarily due to the decrease in servicing fees. See the “Other Market Risk” section of this MD&A for further information regarding the risks pertaining to the valuation of our MSRs.  Investment banking income increased by $37 million, or 64%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $48 million, or 42%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were primarily attributable to strong syndicated finance fees, which resulted from continued market penetration. We note that investment banking income has and will continue to experience volatility due to market factors.  Trading account profits and commissions decreased by $56 million, or 51%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in valuation gains on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs as our credit spreads tightened. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, trading account profits and commissions were essentially flat compared to the same period in 2010.  In 2011 and 2010, we repositioned the securities AFS portfolio in response to market conditions. Net securities gains decreased by $25 million, or 44%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010 and increased by $38 million, or 66%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. See “Securities Available for Sale” in this MD&A for further discussion regarding our repositioning activity.  Other noninterest income increased by $11 million, or 24%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $30 million, or 41%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to current year gains on private equity investments and client leasing transactions.    82    Table of Contents       Noninterest Expense   Table 4                                        Three Months EndedJune 30     %         Six Months EndedJune 30     %        (Dollars in millions)    2011       2010       Change1           2011       2010       Change1          Employee compensation     $638        $575        11      %     $1,256        $1,132        11      %   Employee benefits     110        107        3           246        242        2                                                                    Personnel expense     748        682        10           1,502        1,374        9         Other real estate expense     64        87        (26)          133        133        -         Credit and collection services     60        66        (9)          111        140        (21)         Operating losses     62        16        NM           89        30        NM         Mortgage reinsurance     6        9        (33)          13        18        (28)                                                                    Credit-related costs     192        178        8           346        321        8         Outside processing and software     162        158        3           320        307        4         Net occupancy expense     89        90        (1)          178        181        (2)         Regulatory assessments     81        65        25           152        129        18         Marketing and customer development     46        44        5           84        78        8         Equipment expense     44        42        5           88        83        6         Consulting and legal     29        18        61           43        32        34         Postage and delivery     20        20        -           42        42        -         Other staff expense     20        15        33           35        28        25         Communications     15        16        (6)          31        32        (3)         Amortization of intangible assets     12        13        (8)          23        26        (12)         Net loss/(gain) on debt extinguishment     (1)        63        NM           (2)        54        NM         Other expense     85        99        (14)          165        177        (7)                                                                    Total noninterest expense     $1,542        $1,503        3      %     $3,007       $2,864        5      %                                                            1 NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.  Noninterest Expense  Noninterest expense increased by $39 million, or 3%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $143 million, or 5%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were driven primarily by a rise in compensation expenses associated with improved revenue generation in certain businesses as well as the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in client-facing and loss mitigation positions. Also contributing to the increases in noninterest expense were higher credit-related costs and increases in regulatory assessment expenses partially offset by lower gains on the extinguishment of debt.  Personnel expenses increased by $66 million, or 10%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $128 million, or 9%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases in personnel expenses were attributable to higher incentive compensation related to improved business performance and the previously mentioned increases in full-time equivalent employees.  Credit-related costs increased by $14 million, or 8%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $25 million, or 8%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. Operating losses, which include certain legal and compliance-related costs, drove the increases, partially offset by decreases in credit and collection services expenses. Over time, as the economic environment improves, we expect that credit-related expenses will also improve, but will likely remain elevated compared to the levels realized prior to the economic recession.  Regulatory assessments expense increased by $16 million, or 25%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $23 million, or 18%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were the result of higher average deposit balances and the change in the assessment base for FDIC insurance premiums that took effect at the beginning of the second quarter of 2011.  Consulting and legal expenses increased by $11 million, or 61%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $11 million, or 34%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were attributable to consulting costs associated with specific revenue growth initiatives, as well as costs to address the Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. For additional information regarding the Consent Order, see Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.    83    Table of Contents Other staff expense increased by $5 million, or 33%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $7 million, or 25%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increases were primarily attributable to employee recruitment costs related to the previously mentioned increases in full-time equivalent employees.  Other noninterest expense decreased by $14 million, or 14%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2010, and by $12 million, or 7%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The decreases were primarily attributable to net decreases in litigation reserves upon the resolution of specific legal matters.  Provision for Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the provision for income taxes was $58 million and $91 million, respectively, compared to tax benefits of $50 million and $244 million for the same periods in 2010, respectively. The provision represents a 24.5% and 20.2% effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively, compared to a (133.1%) and (62.2%) effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively. We calculated income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 based on actual year-to-date results. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the effective tax rate was primarily a result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. In addition, the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was also impacted by $15 million of net unfavorable discrete items. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the pre-tax loss as well as the aforementioned favorable permanent tax items. See additional discussion related to the provision for income taxes in Note 9, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.  In determining whether a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is necessary, we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax law, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. The cumulative valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset for certain state carryforwards was $51 million and $50 million as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. We expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryback period or in future years. Therefore, no valuation allowance is required against federal deferred tax assets or the remaining state deferred tax assets, and we estimate that on a consolidated basis, we have a net deferred tax liability at June 30, 2011.  Loans  We report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, or classes, which further identify loans based upon common risk characteristics.  The commercial and industrial class includes loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards, as well as, other wholesale lending activities. Loans that are reported in the commercial real estate and commercial construction classes are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the underlying real estate.  Residential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans. Residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of both first-lien equity lines and closed-end second-lien loans. At June 30, 2011, 29% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 71% were in a junior lien position. For home equity products in a junior lien position, we service 28% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product.  Consumer other direct loans consist primarily of nonguaranteed student loans and consumer indirect loans consist of loans secured by automobiles or recreational vehicles.    84    Table of Contents       Loan Portfolio by Types of Loans   Table 5                     (Dollars in millions)    June 30, 2011      December 31, 2010     % Change          Commercial loans:                           Commercial & industrial1     $45,922        $44,753        3      %   Commercial real estate     5,707        6,167        (7)         Commercial construction     1,740        2,568        (32)                                            Total commercial loans     53,369        53,488        -         Residential loans:                     Residential mortgages - guaranteed     4,513        4,520        -         Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed2     23,224        23,959        (3)         Home equity products     16,169        16,751        (3)         Residential construction     1,118        1,291        (13)                                            Total residential loans     45,024        46,521        (3)         Consumer loans:                     Guaranteed student loans     4,620        4,260        8         Other direct     1,863        1,722        8         Indirect     9,630        9,499        1         Credit cards     407        485        (16)                                            Total consumer loans         16,520              15,966              3                                                LHFI     $114,913        $115,975        (1)      %                                      LHFS           $2,052                 $3,501                 (41)         %  1Includes $4 million of loans carried at fair value at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  2Includes $445 million and $488 million of loans carried at fair value at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  Loans Held for Investment  LHFI decreased by $1.1 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in nonguaranteed residential mortgages, home equity products, commercial real estate loans, and commercial construction loans. We continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio, as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further reducing our residential real estate exposure. We believe that the reduction in higher risk balances and the growth in specific commercial and consumer loans constitutes a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. Overall, loan growth and loan demand remains weaker than we would like, but we are pleased with the progress that we have been able to make in growing selected areas of our portfolio while concurrently reducing our risk. We expect declines in the higher risk portfolios to continue in the future, though, given the smaller aggregate balance, the absolute dollar decline could moderate somewhat. As such, the runoff in these portfolios could be less of a headwind for total loan growth than it has been in prior quarters.  Commercial loans decreased by $119 million, or less than 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decline was largely attributable to decreases in commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans, largely offset by an increase in commercial and industrial loans. Commercial construction loans decreased by $828 million, or 32%, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure and significantly limiting new production under tighter underwriting standards. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial loans grew by $1.2 billion, or 3%, primarily due to larger corporate borrowers; the increase was most pronounced within areas that we have been targeting for growth, such as asset based lending, middle market lending, and certain industry verticals within CIB.  Residential loans decreased by $1.5 billion, or 3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, primarily to due to payments and payoffs, as well as transfers to OREO and current year net charge-offs. The decline in residential loans was primarily in the higher risk categories, including certain nonguaranteed residential mortgages, home equity products, and residential construction loans.    85    Table of Contents Consumer loans increased by $554 million, or 3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $360 million, or 8%, increase in guaranteed student loans and a $141 million, or 8%, increase in other direct loans partially offset by a $78 million, or 16%, decline in consumer credit card loans.  Loans Held for Sale  LHFS decreased by $1.4 billion, or 41%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decline was attributable to a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume, as higher mortgage interest rates affected loan demand.  Asset Quality  During the second quarter we continued, and in some cases accelerated, the multi-quarter trend of improvements that we have seen among all of our primary metrics. We continue to expect that additional improvement in early stage delinquencies, particularly in our residential portfolio, will be tied to the condition of the economy, as commercial and consumer delinquency rates are already at relatively low levels.  The commercial and industrial loan portfolio continues to perform well, as low delinquency levels were accompanied by a modest decline in NPLs during the quarter. Charge-offs increased slightly as we resolved certain NPLs, but remain well within our expectations.  Commercial real estate net charge-offs increased during the quarter, although the increase in charge-offs was offset by a decline in NPLs. We continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition, the quality of our underwriting, and our ongoing management disciplines. Given the stresses in the commercial real estate market, we have performed a thorough analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio in order to identify loans with an increased risk of default. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with the client to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client’s financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the client’s and guarantor’s, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes.  Commercial construction NPLs declined again this quarter, as we continue to resolve and work through our remaining exposure to these loans. This decline in NPLs was partially attributable to increased payoffs and paydowns. We continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning for problem loans. For example, we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrower capacity and their ability to service obligations in a steep market decline. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered material relative to total loans outstanding.  Net charge-offs, NPLs, and early stage delinquencies in the residential mortgages portfolio declined during the second quarter. Our outlook for the residential mortgage portfolio, based on improving delinquency trends, is for reduced frequency of default over the next few quarters despite the potential for some offsetting increases in severity due to lower home values.  Net charge-offs for the home equity portfolio declined during the quarter, while NPLs and early stage delinquencies remained relatively stable. Runoff in this portfolio has been concentrated in the higher risk categories, where no new production has occurred and little to no line availability exists.  The residential construction portfolio, which is primarily comprised of lot and land loans to individuals, remained relatively stable in terms of NPLs and net charge-offs, while we experienced another quarter of declines in early stage delinquencies. Net charge-offs are expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio. Further, while there may be some variability, we generally expect the trend of declining NPLs to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to OREO and, ultimately, disposition.  For the consumer portfolios, asset quality was stable to modestly improved. Early stage delinquencies, excluding guaranteed student loans, declined during the quarter. Meanwhile, the level of nonperforming consumer loans and net charge-offs remained relatively stable compared to the first quarter of 2011.    86    Table of Contents We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country.

Allowance for Credit Losses  At June 30, 2011, the allowance for credit losses was $2.8 billion, which includes both the ALLL as well as the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience, is shown in the table below:    87    Table of Contents       Summary of Credit Losses Experience   Table 7                                          Three Months EndedJune 30,         % Change      Six Months EndedJune 30,         % Change     (Dollars in millions)    2011           2010             2011           2010                        Allowance for Credit Losses                                             Balance - beginning of period     $2,908           $3,276           (11)        $3,032           $3,235           (6)  %    Benefit for unfunded commitments     (3)           (40)           93        (7)           (55)           87      Provision for loan losses:                                             Commercial loans     124           270           (54)        232           485           (52)      Residential loans     252           413           (39)        574           1,014           (43)      Consumer loans     19           19           -        40           80           (50)                                                                      Total provision for loan losses     395           702           (44)        846           1,579           (46)                                                                      Charge-offs:                                             Commercial loans     (220)           (251)           (12)        (405)           (443)           (9)      Residential loans     (303)           (470)           (36)        (688)           (1,078)           (36)      Consumer loans     (40)           (47)           (15)        (85)           (109)           (22)                                                                      Total charge-offs     (563)           (768)           (27)        (1,178)           (1,630)           (28)                                                                      Recoveries:                                             Commercial loans     41           29           41        70           52           35      Residential loans     6           5           20        11           10           10      Consumer loans     11           12           (8)        21           25           (16)                                                                      Total recoveries     58           46           26        102           87           17                                                                      Net charge-offs     (505)           (722)           (30)        (1,076)           (1,543)           (30)                                                                      Balance - end of period      $2,795            $3,216           (13)         $2,795            $3,216           (13)  %                                                                                Components:                                             ALLL     $2,744           $3,156           (13)                           Unfunded commitments reserve1     51           60           (15)                                                                                 Allowance for credit losses     $2,795           $3,216           (13)                                                                                             Average loans     $114,920           $113,016           2        $115,040           $113,721           1  %    Period-end loans outstanding     114,913           112,925           2                                       Ratios:                                             Allowance to period-end loans2,3     2.40      %     2.81      %     (15)                           Allowance to NPLs2,4     76.57           67.64           13                           Allowance to net charge-offs (annualized)2     1.35      x     1.09      x     24                           Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)     1.76      %     2.57      %     (32)        1.89      %     2.74      %     (31)  %    Provision for loan losses to average loans (annualized)     1.38           2.49           (45)        1.48           2.80           (47)      Recoveries to total charge-offs     10.3           6.0           72        8.7           5.3           64     1The unfunded commitments reserve is separately recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  2This ratio is calculated using the ALLL.  3$449 million and $422 million, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from period-end loans in the calculation.  4$26 million and $33 million, respectively, of NPLs carried at fair value were excluded from NPLs in the calculation.  Charge-offs  Net charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2011 declined by $217 million, or 30%, versus the three months ended June 30, 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, net charge-offs declined by $467 million, or 30%, versus the six months ended June 30, 2010. The decline in net charge-offs occurred across each segment of our loan portfolio and was particularly notable for residential loans. As a percentage of average loans, annualized net charge-offs were 1.76% and 2.57% during the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 1.89% and 2.74%, respectively. The improvements in these figures were the result of improved asset quality. We currently expect net charge-offs to trend down over time, however, we believe third quarter net charge-offs will approximate second quarter net charge-offs.    88    Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses  For the three months ended June 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses decreased by $307 million, or 44%, versus the three months ended June 30, 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses decreased by $733 million, or 46%, versus the six months ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was attributable to significantly lower net charge-offs and the decline in the ALLL resulting from improved credit quality.  ALLL and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  The allocation of our ALLL by loan segment is shown in the tables below:                                Allowance for Loan Losses by Loan Segment       Table 8            June 30, 2011     December 31, 2010    (Dollars in millions)    ALLL       Segment  ALLL as a  % of total  ALLL       Loan  segment as  a % of total  loans       ALLL       Segment  ALLL as a %  of total ALLL       Loan  segment as a  % of total  loans      Commercial loans     $1,200        44 %       47 %       $1,303        44 %       46 %     Residential loans     1,395        51        39        1,498        50        40      Consumer loans     149        5        14        173        6        14                                                                    Total     $2,744        100 %       100 %       $2,974        100 %       100 %                                                                  The ALLL decreased by $230 million, or 8%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, with commercial, residential, and consumer loans-related ALLL decreasing $103 million, $103 million, and $24 million, respectively. The decrease in ALLL was commensurate with the improved credit quality of each segment, including a reduction in higher-risk balances, lower emerging risks in the portfolio, as evidenced by the lower delinquency rates, and the recognition of current year net charge-offs absorbing existing risk. Our risk profile continues to improve, such that higher-risk loans comprised only 10% of our entire loan portfolio and lower-risk government guaranteed loans represented 8% of the portfolio as of June 30, 2011. The variables most impacting the ALLL continue to be unemployment, residential real estate property values, and the variability and relative strength of the housing market. At this point in the cycle, we expect the ALLL to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality and overall economic conditions. As of June 30, 2011, the allowance to period-end loans ratio was 2.40%, down 18 basis points from December 31, 2010, consistent with our continued de-risking of our loan portfolio during the period. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs improved to 76.57% as of June 30, 2011 from 72.86% as of December 31, 2010. The increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $500 million decrease in NPLs partially offset by the decline in ALLL.  The reserve for unfunded commitments was $51 million as of June 30, 2011, a decrease of $7 million, or 12%, versus a reserve of $58 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the reserve was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers.    89    Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets            Nonperforming Assets     Table 9                      (Dollars in millions)    June 30,  2011       December 31,  2010       %  Change      Nonaccrual/NPLs:                  Commercial loans                    Commercial & industrial1     $537        $584        (8)  %    Commercial real estate     399        342        17      Commercial construction     627        961        (35)                                      Total commercial NPLs     1,563        1,887        (17)      Residential loans                    Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed2     1,412        1,543        (8)      Home equity products     335        355        (6)      Residential construction     266        290        (8)                                      Total residential NPLs     2,013        2,188        (8)        Consumer loans                  Other direct     9        10        (10)      Indirect     25        25        -                                      Total consumer NPLs     34        35        (3)                                        Total nonaccrual/NPLs     3,610        4,110        (12)      OREO3     483        596        (19)      Other repossessed assets     11        52        (79)                                        Total nonperforming assets     $4,104        $4,758        (14)  %                                         Accruing loans past due 90 days or more     $1,636        $1,565        5  %    TDRs:                  Accruing restructured loans         2,719              2,613              4          Nonaccruing restructured loans4     923        1,005        (8)      Ratios:                  NPLs to total loans     3.14   %      3.54   %         Nonperforming assets to total loans plus                  OREO and other repossessed assets     3.56        4.08             1Includes $4 million of loans carried at fair value at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.   2 Includes $23 million and $24 million of loans carried at fair value at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.   3 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $175 million and $195 million at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.   4 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.               Nonperforming assets decreased by $654 million, or 14%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $500 million reduction in NPLs as a result of our problem loan resolution efforts. Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the U.S. housing market correction. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming assets portfolio. Nonetheless, we expect that we will see continued declines in NPLs throughout the rest of the year.    90    Table of Contents Nonperforming Loans  Nonperforming commercial loans decreased by $324 million, or 17%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, as a $334 million decrease in commercial construction NPLs and a $47 million decrease in commercial and industrial NPLs was partially offset by a $57 million increase in commercial real estate NPLs related to a small number of large commercial real estate borrowers. We continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate NPLs as a result of the ongoing commercial real estate correction cycle.  Nonperforming residential loans decreased by $175 million, or 8%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, primarily as a result of a $131 million decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs. The $131 million decrease was partially attributable to the reclassification of certain nonperforming residential mortgages as held for sale to reflect our intention to sell these mortgages. We recorded an incremental charge-off of $10 million in the first quarter in connection with the decision to transfer and sell these mortgages. Approximately $34 million of these reclassified NPLs were sold during the quarter; the remaining $13 million were transferred back to LHFI as they were no longer deemed marketable for sale. The remaining decrease was attributable to lower inflows of NPLs and net charge-offs.  Nonperforming consumer loans decreased by $1 million, or 3%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, primarily as a result of a $1 million decrease in indirect consumer NPLs. The decrease was driven by net charge-offs of existing nonperforming consumer loans during the year, largely offset by the migration of delinquent consumer loans to nonaccrual status.  Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting. We recognized $10 million and $11 million of cash basis interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $18 million and $22 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $65 million and $89 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $136 million and $185 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have been recorded.  Other Nonperforming Assets  OREO decreased by $113 million, or 19%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decline consisted of a $130 million decrease in residential homes and an $18 million decrease in residential construction related properties, partially offset by a $35 million increase in commercial properties. During the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $351 million and $344 million, respectively, and net losses on sales of OREO of $1 million and net gains of $5 million, respectively, inclusive of the valuation reserve attributed to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Gains and losses on sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 37% and 41%, respectively, of OREO; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value, less costs to sell. Further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.  Other repossessed assets decreased by $41 million, or 79%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decrease was largely attributable to the sale of repossessed assets during the year.  Accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by $71 million, or 5%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages or student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency. At June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $69 million and $84 million, respectively, of past due accruing loans were not guaranteed.  At the end of 2010, we completed an internal review of STM’s residential foreclosure processes. We have taken steps to improve upon our processes as a result of our review. In addition, the Federal Reserve recently conducted a horizontal review of the nation’s largest mortgage loan servicers, including SunTrust. Following this review, SunTrust and other servicers entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and have filed a copy of it as an Exhibit to this Form 10-Q. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and then make any appropriate remediation, reimbursement, or adjustment. We have already begun implementing the requirements prescribed by the Consent Order. However, this may result in additional delays in the foreclosure process at a time when foreclosure    91    Table of Contents upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, is already elevated. Any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. We expect that our costs will increase in 2011 as a result of the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment, revise affidavit filings and make any other operational changes. This may result in higher noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal expenses, in our Mortgage line of business. In addition, process enhancements could increase our default servicing costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales temporarily may increase, and this may result in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances, and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our MSR asset. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our process enhancements, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes, could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. Nevertheless, we believe these additional costs will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or EPS.  Restructured Loans  In order to maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing review that is programmatic in nature. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees, to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extension in terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms. Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as accruing TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, it is probable that the loan will likely continue to be reported as TDR for the remaining life of the loan, or foreclosed and sold. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At June 30, 2011, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $397 million.  The following table displays our residential real estate TDR portfolio, which includes both guaranteed and nonguaranteed loans, by modification type and payment status at June 30, 2011. The table excludes loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified. Such loans totaled less than $100 million at June 30, 2011.

At June 30, 2011, our total TDR portfolio was $3.6 billion and was composed of $3.2 billion, or 87%, of residential loans (predominately first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $466 million, or 13%, of commercial loans (predominately income-producing properties), and $13 million, or less than 1%, of direct consumer loans.    92    Table of Contents Accruing TDRs increased by $106 million, or 4%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. The increase in accruing TDRs was attributable to a general increase in the number of loan modifications during the year. Nonaccruing TDRs decreased by $82 million, or 8%, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, reflecting net charge-offs during the year. The size of our TDR portfolio increased by less than $100 million upon adopting the new TDR accounting guidance as of July 1, 2011. See Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information.  Interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such interest income recorded was $28 million and $24 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $55 million and $44 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $39 million and $35 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $76 million and $65 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have been recorded.    93    Table of Contents SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE  The following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in federal agency securities, CP, derivative contracts and trading loans due to normal business activity. The increase was offset by a net decrease in equity securities due primarily to issuer redemptions of ARS municipal fund preferred shares.  Certain illiquid securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007 from affiliates, which included SIVs that are collateralized by various domestic and foreign assets, residential MBS, including Alternative A-paper and subprime collateral, CDOs, and commercial loans, as well as senior interests retained from SunTrust-sponsored securitizations. During the first quarter of 2011, we recognized approximately $17 million in net market valuation gains related to these securities and received approximately $77 million in cash from sales and paydowns related to these securities, thereby eliminating our exposure to these distressed assets.  The Company also purchased ARS primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 as a result of the FINRA investigation. See additional discussion related to FINRA’s ARS investigation in Note 14, “Contingencies.” The fair value of these ARS recorded in trading assets declined to $54 million as of June 30, 2011 compared to $147 million as of December 31, 2010. The reduction was due primarily to issuer redemptions of preferred equity ARS, offset slightly by a gain in fair value of the ARS. The majority of these remaining ARS securities are CDOs collateralized by trust preferred bank debt.  Trading liabilities increased $348 million, or 13%, since December 31, 2010 due primarily to an increase in derivative contracts as a result of normal business activity.    94    Table of Contents         Securities Available for Sale     Table 12                              As of June 30, 2011    (Dollars in millions)    Amortized Cost      Unrealized Gains      Unrealized Losses     Fair Value      U.S. Treasury securities     $730        $4        $8        $726      Federal agency securities     2,519        48        1        2,566      U.S. states and political subdivisions     499        19        2        516      MBS - agency     18,797        536        2        19,331      MBS - private     335        1        25        311      CDO securities     337        -        -        337      ABS     615        14        4        625      Corporate and other debt securities     54        3        1        56      Coke common stock     -        2,019        -        2,019      Other equity securities1     728        1        -        729                                                Total securities AFS     $24,614        $2,645        $43        $27,216                                                  1At June 30, 2011, other equity securities included $205 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock (par value), $391 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock (par value), and $132 million in mutual fund investments (par value).

Securities Available for Sale  The securities AFS portfolio is managed as part of our overall asset and liability management process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $27.2 billion as of June 30, 2011, an increase of $321 million, or 1%, versus December 31, 2010. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the six months reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile. These changes included reducing the size of the U.S. Treasury securities portfolio by $4.8 billion, from which the proceeds were partly used to repurchase our Series C and Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock that we issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP’s CPP. The proceeds were also used to increase agency MBS and federal agency securities. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we recorded $96 million in net realized gains primarily from the sale of securities AFS as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio, compared to net realized gains of $58 million during the same period in 2010. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.    95    Table of Contents At June 30, 2011, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.6 billion in net unrealized gains, comprised of a $2.0 billion unrealized gain from our remaining 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $583 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.4 billion in net unrealized gains, which were comprised of a $2.0 billion unrealized gain from our remaining 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $438 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. We entered into two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective July 15, 2008 with a major, unaffiliated financial institution (the “Counterparty”) collectively covering our 30 million Coke shares. Under The Agreements, we must deliver to the Counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of Coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares. The Counterparty is obligated to settle The Agreements for no less than $38.67 per share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the “Minimum Proceeds”). The share forward agreements give us the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the Counterparty, at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement, any of the 30 million Coke common shares that are not delivered to the Counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements. The Agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our 30 million Coke common shares at a price no less than $38.67 per share, while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the Coke common shares up to $66.02 per share and $65.72 per share, under each of the respective variable forward agreements. Additional details related to these forward agreements can be found in Note 11, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  For the three months ended June 30, 2011, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio increased to 3.40% compared to 3.19% for the three months ended June 30, 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio increased to 3.29% compared to 3.21% for the six months ended June 30, 2010. The yield increases were largely due to reduced holdings of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities and increased holdings of higher yielding agency MBS securities over the last six months.  The portfolio’s effective duration decreased to 3.0% as of June 30, 2011 from 3.3% as of December 31, 2010. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 3.0% suggests an expected price change of 3.0% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.  The credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong at June 30, 2011 and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns.  We expect the size of our securities portfolio to remain relatively stable in the near term. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. Accordingly, we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and/or declining deposits.    96    Table of Contents BORROWINGS            Short-Term Borrowings     Table 13                                              As of June 30, 2011     Three Months Ended June 30, 2011     Six Months Ended June 30, 2011    (Dollars in millions)    Balance       Rate            MaximumOutstanding at any Month-End            MaximumOutstanding at any Month-End           Daily Average       Daily Average             Balance       Rate         Balance       Rate        Fed funds purchased¹     $939        0.12   %      $1,001       0.12   %      $990        $1,057        0.15   %      $1,169      Securities sold under agreement to repurchase¹     2,253        0.14        2,264       0.14        2,253        2,283        0.15        2,411      CP issued     35        1.00        149       1.20        196        159        1.10        196      Other short-term borrowings2     2,756        0.34        2,785       0.34        2,909        2,688        0.35        2,909                                                                Total short-term borrowings     $5,983             $6,199                 $6,187                                                                                 As of June 30, 2010     Three Months Ended June 30, 2010     Six Months Ended June 30, 2010                    MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End           MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End    (Dollars in millions)   Balance     Rate     Daily Average       Daily Average            Balance     Rate       Balance     Rate       Fed funds purchased¹     $1,260        0.18   %      $1,224        0.18   %      $1,370        $1,319        0.18   %      $3,163      Securities sold under agreement to repurchase¹     2,477        0.16        2,632        0.14        2,673        2,308        0.12        2,794      CP issued     180        0.50        246        0.63        223        615        0.37        1,009      Other short-term borrowings2     2,337        0.38        2,291        0.46        2,422        2,079        0.49        2,422                                                                Total short-term borrowings     $6,254             $6,393                  $6,321                                                                           1Fed funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of borrowings.   2Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral held by the Company, U.S. Treasury demand notes, and other short-term borrowed funds.         Our period-end short-term borrowings decreased $271 million, or 4%, from June 30, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in Fed funds purchased of $321 million and a $145 million decline in CP outstanding, partially offset by an increase in dealer collateral of $205 million.  Average short-term borrowings decreased by $194 million, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily due to average declines in Fed funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $223 million and $368 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase of $494 million in average other short-term borrowings. For the first six months of 2011, average short-term borrowings decreased by $134 million, or 2%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010 as a result of declines in average Fed funds purchased and average CP issued of $262 million and $456 million, respectively, were largely offset by a rise in average other short-term borrowings of $609 million. The amount of average CP outstanding declined, in part, due to a downgrade of our short-term debt ratings during 2010.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, and for the three months ended June 30, 2010, our period-end outstanding balances were not materially different from maximum monthly outstanding balances or from the daily averages for any category of short-term borrowings. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, Fed funds purchased was the only category of short-term borrowings with a significant difference between the maximum outstanding balance and the period ended balance, resulting from our temporary increase in borrowings during January 2010, which was part of our ordinary balance sheet management practices.  Long-Term Debt  During the six months ended June 30, 2011, our long-term debt increased by $45 million. The change was primarily due to our issuance of $1.0 billion of five year 3.60% senior notes during the first quarter of 2011, offset by the maturity and redemption of $852 million of our ten year 6.375% subordinated notes and our repurchase of $220 million of fixed rate senior and junior subordinated notes that were due in 2011 and 2036.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures (risk weighted assets) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles.    97    Table of Contents Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities.  Both the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk weighted assets. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average assets, a regulatory exposure measure with adjustments similar to those used to calculate Tier 1 capital. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.  In September 2010, the BCBS announced new regulatory capital requirements (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements, through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements, new capital conservation buffers, and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure. Basel III would impose a new common equity requirement of 7%, comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The transition period for banks to meet the revised common equity requirement will begin in 2013, with full implementation in 2019. The BCBS has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional, counter-cyclical capital buffer on top of Basel III standards. The new rule also proposes the deduction of certain assets in measuring Tier 1 capital. It is anticipated that U.S. regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS. We monitor our capital structure as to compliance with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and take into account these new regulations as they are published and become applicable to us in our capital planning.

As a result of the CCAR, some of the bank holding companies increased or restarted dividends payments, common stock repurchases, or repaid U.S. government capital borrowed under the CPP. Upon completion of their review, the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the CCAR in December 2010. As such, during March 2011, we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan, including public offerings of $1.0 billion of common stock and $1.0 billion of senior debt. In addition, we used the proceeds from those offerings, as well as other available funds, to repurchase $3.5 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C and $1.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP’s CPP. As a result of the repurchase of Series C and D preferred stock, we incurred a one-time, non-cash charge to net income available to common shareholders of $74 million during the first quarter of 2011 related to accelerating the outstanding discount accretion on the Series C and D preferred stock.  As a result of the common stock offering our common equity was enhanced, increasing by $1.0 billion, net of issuance costs, adding approximately 35 million new common shares to our total outstanding common shares. Conversely, during the six months ended June 30, 2011, total Shareholders’ Equity decreased by $3.5 billion from December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of the repurchase of the Series C and D preferred stock offset by the issuance of the new common shares.    98    Table of Contents While our total equity decreased, our capital levels remain strong. Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital ratios were 9.22%, 11.11%, and 14.01 %, respectively, at June 30, 2011 compared to 8.08%, 13.67%, and 16.54%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 Capital ratio excluding preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was 10.08%. The increase in Tier 1 common equity was the result of the issuance of common equity. The decline in Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios was due to the reduction in total equity as a result of the repurchase of the preferred shares issued to the U.S. Treasury. Overall, we remain well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to the current U.S. regulatory standards, and our capital ratios exceed the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee under Basel III and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies.  We declared and paid common dividends totaling $6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2011, or $0.01 per common share, compared to $5 million, or $0.01 per common share, during the same period in 2010. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $11 million, or $0.02 per common share, compared to $10 million, or $0.02 per common share during the same period in 2010. In addition, we declared dividends payable during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010 of $2 million and $4 million, respectively, on our Series A preferred stock. Further, during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we declared dividends payable of $0 million and $60 million, and $60 million and $120 million, respectively, to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock.  We remain subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase our dividend. However, with the repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the CPP, we can return capital to our shareholders in the form of an increased common dividend, and on August 9, 2011, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share, payable on September 15, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 1, 2011. See Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Form 10-Q for additional information on our dividend. In addition, limits exist on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. There was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations at June 30, 2011.    99    Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  There have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  There have been no significant changes to our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, except as discussed below.

Operational Risk Management  There have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Market Risk Management  Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet, which includes all loans (including variable rate loans) and any associated hedges. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities, investment portfolio, Coke common stock, MSRs, loan warehouse and pipeline, and debt and brokered deposits carried at fair value. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board.  Market Risk from Non-Trading Activities  As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.  The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous 100 basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates.        December 31, 2010   December 31, 2010       Economic Perspective       Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months  (Basis points)    June 30, 2011     December 31, 2010    Rate Change         +100   (0.6%)   0.2%   -100   (1.2%)   (0.9%)  The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits/(losses) and commissions from a financial reporting perspective.    100    Table of Contents             Financial Reporting Perspective      Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income      Over 12 Months  (Basis points)    June 30, 2011     December 31, 2010    Rate Change         +100   (0.3%)   0.5%   -100   (1.3%)   (1.0%)  The difference from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to the +100 and -100 basis point shock scenarios is primarily due to an increase in liability sensitivity from projected fixed rate loan and investment security growth, funded with short-term borrowings and customer deposits.  We also perform valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios.  As of June 30, 2011, the MVE profile indicates changes with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates.                Estimated % Change in MVE  (Basis points)    June 30, 2011     December 31, 2010    Rate Change         +100   (3.1%)   (3.4%)   -100   (0.2%)   1.1%  While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.  Trading Activities  Under established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio. Our VAR calculation measures the potential losses using a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period. This means that, on average, losses are expected to exceed VAR two or three times per year. We had no backtest exceptions to our overall VAR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. The following table displays high, low, and average VAR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.    101    Table of Contents                  For the Three Months Ended     For the Six Months Ended       June 30   June 30  (Dollars in millions)   2011   2010   2011   2010   Average VAR   $5   $9   $5   $10   High VAR   $6   $11   $7   $13   Low VAR   $4   $7   $4   $7  Average VAR during the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 was lower compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to sales, paydowns, and maturities of illiquid trading assets. This is a result of continuing to manage down illiquid asset holdings where possible, as they are not part of our core business activities. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, averaged $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. The increase in average trading balances is primarily a result of an increase in the TRS portfolio and growth in fixed income trading partially offset by reductions in illiquid asset holdings. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, were $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Liquidity Risk  Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity.  The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. As of June 30, 2011, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $24.6 billion of securities, of which approximately 90% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.  We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a liquid securities portfolio, although the Parent Company invested approximately $5 billion of cash in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities during 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 prior to retiring its TARP preferred securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital related) for an extended period of months in accordance with Company risk limits.  We assess liquidity needs in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. The table below presents period-end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, which we believe exceeds any contingent liquidity needs.

Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. In addition, contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. As of June 30, 2011, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and DBRS all maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings, while Fitch maintained a “Positive” outlook, citing improved credit and earnings trends. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the “Stable” and “Positive” credit rating outlooks.

As of June 30, 2011, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. In the absence of robust loan demand, we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to purchase and retire certain high-cost debt securities or other borrowings. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, pursuant to a capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve, we repurchased high-cost Tier 1 capital securities, including $4.9 billion of our Series C and Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP’s CPP. Despite these transactions, the Parent Company retains a material cash position, in accordance with Company policies and risk limits discussed in greater detail below.  Sources of Funds. Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, primarily gathered from our retail branch network, are our largest and most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits totaled $121.7 billion as of June 30, 2011, up from $120.0 billion as of December 31, 2010.  We also maintain access to a diversified collection of wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding totaled $22.7 billion as of June 30, 2011, down slightly from $22.9 billion as of December 31, 2010. In total, the Bank and Parent Company have approximately $3.2 billion of wholesale funding maturing during the second half of 2011. Approximately $852 million of wholesale debt matured during the six months ended June 30, 2011 and was redeemed at par. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and Fed funds purchased, totaled $6.8 billion as of June 30, 2011, down from $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2010.  We also have access to wholesale liquidity via the capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized outstanding issuance of up to $5.0 billion of such securities, of which approximately $3.0 billion of issuance capacity remains available. The Bank also maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of June 30, 2011, the Bank had capacity to issue $33.7 billion of notes under the Global Bank Note program. Borrowings under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Our capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor.  Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. Through the second quarter of 2011, we had no Parent Company debt that matured, and none is scheduled to mature during the remainder of 2011. Approximately $1.0 billion of Parent Company debt is scheduled to mature in 2012. Much of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.    103    Table of Contents The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances.  Recent Developments. Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective, the potential impact of which cannot be presently quantified. However, we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and conservative liquidity management practices. See discussion of certain current legislative and regulatory proposals within the “Executive Overview” section of this MD&A.  Other Liquidity Considerations. As detailed in Table 16, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $60.8 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at June 30, 2011. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $5.5 billion in letters of credit as of June 30, 2011, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $3.4 billion of these letters as of June 30, 2011 supported variable rate demand obligations.

As of June 30, 2011, our cumulative UTBs amounted to $99 million. The gross liability for interest related to UTBs was $20 million as of June 30, 2011. These UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and, if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal, operating cash flows, likely over multiple years.  Other Market Risk  Except as discussed below, there have been no other significant changes to other market risk as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  MSRs, which are carried at fair value, totaled $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $47 million and $136 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $67 million and $134 million, respectively. We recorded decreases of $162 million and $145 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively. We recorded decreases of $411 million and $520 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively. Increases or decrease in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows.      104    Table of Contents For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, we recorded losses related to MSRs of $29 million and $54 million (including decay of $41 million and $94 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, we recorded losses related to MSRs of $19 million and $52 million (including decay of $54 million and $118 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. We continue to evaluate the impact that the Consent Order may have, and we currently do not expect the impact to be material unless third party price indications reflect lower market valuations.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  See discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 6, “Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities,” and Note 13, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. Except as noted within the “Long-Term Debt” section of this MD&A, there have been no significant changes in our Contractual Commitments as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.    105    Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS  The following table for our reportable business segments compares net income/(loss) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 to the same periods in 2010:           Net Income/(Loss) by Segment   Table 17                            Three Months EndedJune 30     Six Months EndedJune 30    (Dollars in millions)    2011       2010       2011       2010      Retail Banking     $39        $39        $68        $37      Diversified Commercial Banking     56        40        122        85      CRE     (82)        (86)        (159)        (127)      CIB     103        67        196        104      Mortgage     (147)        (228)        (312)        (541)      W&IM     37        36        75        62      Corporate Other and Treasury     124        134        269        248      Reconciling Items     48        10        99        (17)     The following table for our reportable business segments compares average loans and average deposits for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011 to the same periods in 2010:           Average Loans and Deposits by Segment   Table 18                            Three Months Ended June 30        Average Loans     Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits    (Dollars in millions)    2011       2010      2011     2010     Retail Banking     $35,021        $32,740        $77,372        $75,502      Diversified Commercial Banking     22,649        22,457        18,955        18,162      CRE     7,354        10,185        1,520        1,609      CIB     13,338        10,762        8,241        6,663      Mortgage     28,822        28,662        2,695        2,749      W&IM     7,522        8,072        12,148        11,070      Corporate Other and Treasury     253        200        1,000        802            Six Months Ended June 30        Average Loans     Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits        2011     2010     2011     2010     Retail Banking     $35,176        $32,689        $76,640        $74,681      Diversified Commercial Banking     22,585        22,596        19,064        18,731      CRE     7,654        10,501        1,475        1,679      CIB     12,783        10,871        8,110        6,334      Mortgage     29,067        28,773        2,838        2,597      W&IM     7,567        8,070        12,227        11,052      Corporate Other and Treasury     245        257        986        809     See Note 15, “Business Segment Reporting,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our segment structure, basis of presentation and internal management reporting methodologies.  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  Six Months Ended June 30, 2011 vs. 2010  Retail Banking  Retail Banking reported net income of $68 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, an increase of $31 million, or 84%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to lower provision for credit losses and higher net interest income that was partially offset by lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense.    106    Table of Contents Net interest income was $1.3 billion, an increase of $19 million, or 2%, from the same period in 2010. The increase was driven by the benefits derived from higher average loan balances and spreads and higher average deposit balances partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. Average loan balances increased $2.5 billion, or 8%. Indirect installment loans increased $2.7 billion, driven by organic indirect auto production and by the acquisition of $1.7 billion of consumer auto loans in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. Additional growth was the result of the purchase of $1.5 billion of guaranteed student loans during the past twelve months. Partially offsetting those increases were decreases in home equity lines, residential mortgages, and business banking loans. Loan-related net interest income increased $44 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year driven by increased loan volume and higher loan spreads. Average deposit balances increased $2.0 billion, or 3%. Favorable deposit mix trends continued as low cost average deposit balances increased, offsetting a $3.5 billion, or 16%, decline in average time deposits. Deposit-related net interest income decreased $33 million, or 4%, as the value of deposits fell in the current interest rate environment.  Provision for credit losses was $413 million, a decrease of $122 million, or 23%, over the same period in 2010 primarily driven by declines of $54 million in home equity line, $21 million in commercial, $20 million in credit card, and $18 million in residential mortgage loan net charge-offs.  Total noninterest income was $544 million, a decrease of $34 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2010. Service charges on deposits decreased $66 million, or 21%, driven by lower NSF/overdraft fees resulting from Regulation E changes. Those decreases were partially offset by higher interchange and ATM card fees, which increased a combined $29 million, or 13%, primarily due to increased transaction volume and households.  Total noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, up $56 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by increases in other real estate, marketing and advertising, and shared corporate expenses primarily in technology and operational areas.  Diversified Commercial Banking  Diversified Commercial Banking reported net income of $122 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, an increase of $37 million, or 44%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was attributable to a decrease in provision for credit losses and an increase in total revenue.  Net interest income was $344 million, a $28 million, or 9%, increase from the same period in 2010. Average loan balances were relatively flat to prior year. However, the mix of the portfolio changed as an increase in commercial loans was offset by decreases in leasing and commercial real estate loans. Loan-related net interest income increased $26 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2010 due to increased loan spreads. Average deposit balances increased $333 million, or 2%, from the same period in 2010. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as higher cost time deposits declined $534 million, or 40%, while lower cost commercial demand deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 19%. NOW and money market combined average balances decreased $351 million, or 3%. Deposit-related net interest income decreased $3 million, or 2%, due to a modest decrease in overall deposit spreads.  Provision for credit losses was $38 million, a decrease of $26 million, or 41%, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, leasing and consumer mortgages partly offset by higher net charge-offs in tax-exempt loans.  Total noninterest income was $122 million, an increase of $13 million, or 12%, from the prior year driven primarily by leasing revenue.  Total noninterest expense was $235 million, up $7 million, or 3%, from the prior year as lower credit-related expenses were offset with higher overhead and staff expenses.  Commercial Real Estate  CRE reported a net loss of $159 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to a net loss of $127 million for the same period in 2010. The increase in net loss was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses.  Net interest income was $72 million, a $13 million, or 15%, decline from the same period in 2010. Average loan balances declined $2.8 billion, or 27%, largely resulting from a $2.4 billion decrease in commercial real estate loans. Loan-related net interest income decreased $15 million, or 19%, as the decrease in average balances more than offset higher loan spreads. Average deposit balances declined $204 million, or 12%, driven by a $150 million decrease in money market accounts and a $43 million decrease in demand deposits. Deposit-related net interest income declined from prior year by $4 million, or 17%, primarily attributable to decreased average balances and lower deposit spreads.    107    Table of Contents Provision for credit losses was $219 million, an increase of $31 million, or 16%, over the same period in 2010. The increase was predominantly driven by higher net charge-offs of residential construction and development and commercial real estate loans.  Total noninterest income was $48 million, an increase of $8 million, or 20%, from the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to sales and mark-to-market gains related to loans carried at fair value and higher income related to Affordable Housing.  Total noninterest expense was $217 million, an increase of $14 million, or 7%, over the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by higher other real estate expenses.  Corporate and Investment Banking  CIB’s net income for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $196 million, an increase of $92 million, or 88%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was driven by higher total revenues and a decline in provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.  Net interest income was $238 million, an increase of $60 million, or 34%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $1.9 billion, or 18%, increase in average loan balances. The increase in loan balances was largely the result of a $0.9 billion increase in Three Pillars, our CP conduit, and a $0.3 billion increase in asset based lending loans. Line of credit utilization rates are slightly down versus prior year although offset by term loan growth. The increase in average loan balances, as well as higher loan spreads, resulted in a $49 million, or 44%, increase in loan-related net interest income. Total average customer deposits increased $1.8 billion, or 28%, with growth concentrated in money market accounts, demand deposits, and NOW accounts. Higher deposit volumes mitigated the impact of lower deposits spreads which resulted in increased net interest income of $10 million.  Provision for credit losses was $3 million, as net charge-offs declined $33 million, or 92%, from the prior year. Lower net charge-offs related to large corporate borrowers operating in economically sensitive industries.  Total noninterest income was $370 million, an increase of $115 million, or 45%, over the prior year. The increase is primarily due to improved performance in loan syndications, equity underwritings and bond originations, as well as lower loss contingency reserves related to the deterioration of collateral on previously securitized loans and higher merchant banking gains.  Total noninterest expense was $295 million, an increase of $63 million, or 27%, over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher staff expense related to increased revenue generation and higher credit-related expenses.  Mortgage  Mortgage reported a net loss of $312 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, an improvement of $229 million, or 42%, compared to the same period in 2010. The improvement was driven by lower provision for credit losses, lower mortgage repurchase provision, and higher net interest income that was partially offset by reduced mortgage production income due to lower loan volume and higher noninterest expense.  Net interest income was $241 million, up $33 million, or 16%, over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income on loans, which increased $35 million, or 27%, principally due to improved spreads. Total average loans, primarily residential mortgages, were up $294 million, or 1%.  Provision for credit losses was $376 million, a decrease of $315 million, or 46%, from the same period in 2010. The decline was driven by a $241 million decline in residential mortgage loan charge-offs, in addition to a decline in other residential related construction net charge-offs. Net charge-offs in 2011 included charge-offs of $10 million related to $57 million of NPLs transferred to LHFS compared to $51 million in charge-offs in 2010 related to a larger NPL transfer.  Total noninterest income was $156 million, up $31 million, or 25%, compared with the same period in 2010. The increase was principally due to higher production income, which was up $51 million. The improvement was primarily due to lower mortgage repurchase provision, which declined $106 million, or 39%, that was partially offset by reduced income as a result of lower mortgage production. Loan originations were $10.4 billion for the first six months of 2011, compared to $12.6 billion for the same period in the prior year, a 17% decrease. Servicing income of $144 million was down $14 million, or 9%, principally due to lower service fees resulting from a reduction in the total loans serviced. At June 30, 2011, total loans serviced were $162.9 billion compared with $177.8 billion at June 30, 2010, a decline of 8%.    108    Table of Contents Total noninterest expense was $528 million, an increase of $14 million, or 3%, over the prior year. The increase was due to higher staff expenses.  Wealth and Investment Management  W&IM’s net income for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $75 million, an increase of $13 million, or 21%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher trust and retail investment income and net interest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.  Net interest income was $204 million, an increase of $17 million, or 9%, over the prior year driven mostly by deposit-related net interest income. Average loan balances declined $503 million, or 6%, with decreases primarily in consumer direct, commercial real estate, and residential mortgages. However, loan-related net interest income increased $2 million, or 3%, as higher loan spreads more than offset the decrease in average loan balances. Average customer deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 11%, as money market accounts increased $1.6 billion, or 44% and average demand deposits increased $311 million, or 16%. Average time deposits decreased $470 million, or 33%, and NOW accounts decreased $202 million, or 5%. Deposit-related net interest income increased $13 million, or 11%, due to the combination of higher average balances and improved deposit spreads driven by deposit mix.  Provision for credit losses was $28 million, a decrease of $1 million, or 3%, over the prior year primarily due to decreased consumer and commercial loan net charge-offs.  Total noninterest income was $423 million, an increase of $41 million, or 11%, over the prior year. Trust income increased $20 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher market valuations on managed equity assets and higher revenue from our RidgeWorth mutual fund complex. Retail Investment income increased $22 million, or 23%, driven by increased recurring brokerage revenue and annuity income.  As of June 30, 2011, assets under management were approximately $104.7 billion compared to $116.1 billion as of June 30, 2010. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, managed institutional assets, and participant-directed retirement accounts. The June 30, 2010 assets under management included approximately $16 billion of money market mutual fund assets that transferred to a third-party during the latter part of 2010. SunTrust’s total assets under advisement were approximately $201.0 billion, which includes $104.7 billion in assets under management, $49.9 billion in non-managed trust assets, $35.8 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $10.6 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.  Total noninterest expense was $477 million, an increase of $36 million, or 8%, over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by staff expense due to higher compensation associated with revenue growth, as well as increases in structural expense, other real estate expense, and allocated administrative expenses.  Corporate Other and Treasury  Corporate Other and Treasury’s net income for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $269 million, an increase of $21 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased net interest income and lower losses from the extinguishment of debt.  Net interest income was $277 million, an increase of $38 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was mainly due to the interest rate environment and balance sheet risk management strategies. Total average assets decreased $841 million, or 3%, primarily due to a reduction in investment securities. Total average deposits remained consistent with the prior year. Average long-term debt decreased by $3.6 billion, or 22%, compared to last year as we repaid FHLB advances and senior and subordinated bank debt in conjunction with strong consumer and commercial deposit growth.  Total noninterest income was $151 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease was mainly due to less favorable mark-to-market valuations on our public debt carried at fair value partially offset by a $36 million increase in gains of the sale of investment securities.  Total noninterest expense decreased $37 million compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease is mainly due to FHLB debt termination losses in 2010.    109    Table of Contents Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  See “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  The Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2011. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2011. However, the Company believes that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance, but can provide reasonable assurance, that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.  Changes in internal control over financial reporting  There have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of its business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. Although the ultimate outcome of these suits cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of management that none of these matters, when resolved, will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. For additional information, see Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference.      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and in Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this report, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.  Additionally, we delete three existing risk factors. First, we delete the existing risk factors “Recently enacted legislation, legislation enacted in the future, and certain proposed federal programs subject us to increased regulation and may adversely affect us,” and “We have not yet received permission to repay TARP funds,” to reflect the substantial implementation of most expected legislation and regulatory actions, and to reflect our repayment of TARP. We also delete the existing risk factor “SunTrust Bank may be subject to higher deposit insurance assessment” following the publication by the FDIC of its final rule.      Item 2.
