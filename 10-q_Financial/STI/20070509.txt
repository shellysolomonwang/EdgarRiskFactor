Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  The Company added the following risk factor during the quarter:  Our financial instruments carried at fair value expose the Company to certain market risks.  We maintain an available for sale securities portfolio and trading assets which include various types of instruments and maturities. We recently increased the size of trading assets in conjunction with the Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 157 and No. 159. In addition, the Company elected to record selected fixed-rate debt, mortgage loans, securitization warehouses and other trading assets at fair value. The changes in fair value of the financial instruments elected to be carried at fair value pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 159 are recognized in earnings. The financial instruments carried at fair value are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and the Company’s market-based credit spreads, as well as to the risk of default by specific borrowers. The Company manages the market risks associated with these instruments through active hedging arrangements or broader asset/liability management strategies. Changes in the market values of these financial instruments could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may classify additional financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value in the future.   Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
