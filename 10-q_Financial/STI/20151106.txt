Item 1A.RISK FACTORSThe risks described in this report and in the Company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial, also may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or future results. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors," in the Company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K,  which could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, or future results, should be carefully considered.Additionally, we amend the existing risk factor, “Legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position,” by inserting the text below after the sixth paragraph:The FDIC has proposed to apply an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points on all banks with at least $10 billion in assets as a method of increasing its deposit insurance fund (DIF) reserve ratio. As proposed by the FDIC, the surcharge would apply equally to all institutions with $10 billion or more of assets, and would not differ based on the size or complexity of the institution, or the riskiness of its assets. Further, the proposed surcharge would be multiplied by our statutorily defined deposit insurance assessment base (average total assets less tangible equity) rather than just our insured deposits. The FDIC has indicated that the surtax, if enacted, would apply for approximately two years.102Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
