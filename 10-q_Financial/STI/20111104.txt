Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, and in this report, and also include those risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; concerns over market volatility continue; the Dodd-Frank Act makes fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry, some of which may adversely affect our business; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; emergency measures designed to stabilize the U.S. banking system are beginning to wind down; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages; we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, our operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial 75condition and results of operations and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.INTRODUCTIONThis MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated).We are one of the nation’s largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under six business segments: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CRE, CIB, Mortgage, and W&IM, with the remainder in Corporate Other and Treasury. In addition to traditional deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, credit-related insurance, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services.The following analysis of our financial performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this document and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements and related information to conform them to the September 30, 2011 presentation. In the MD&A, net interest income and the net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE and annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as, to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided below in Table 1, Selected Quarterly Financial Data.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWEconomic and regulatoryDuring the quarter, the economic recovery remained slow and uncertain, with unemployment remaining high, the U.S. housing market continuing to show signs of weakness, and consumer confidence remaining low. Unemployment, remaining above 9%, held relatively steady compared to the prior quarter and was slightly lower than year end. The U.S. housing market continued to be weak as evidenced by the large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties, home prices remaining under pressure, construction on new single-family homes remaining at low levels, and sales of existing homes remaining weak. Consumer confidence remained near its lowest level in two years as consumer spending increased at only a moderate pace due in part to inflationary pressures that included elevated commodity prices. Additionally, the financial markets witnessed high levels of volatility due to the economic uncertainty, the long-term U.S. debt downgrade by S&P, and the European debt crisis. Amidst the slumping economic conditions and U.S. debt downgrade, the Federal Reserve indicated that key interest rates will remain at exceptionally low levels, potentially through mid-2013, and announced a new plan to keep longer-term rates low and stimulate the economy by selling a total of $400 billion in short-term U.S. Treasuries and purchasing the same amount of longer-term U.S. Treasuries through June 2012. Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced that it would support conditions in the mortgage markets by reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the recovery, the Federal Reserve maintained a forecast for stable longer-term inflation expectations and gradual economic recovery. During the quarter, we expanded our deposit product offerings, in response to revisions to Regulation Q, to include payment of interest on business demand deposits. As expected, the interest paid during the quarter on these products was nominal, and we expect that to continue. Conversely, during the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve's final rules related to debit card interchange fees will become effective, and we believe the impact to our results will be more material than the Regulation Q changes. These rules will limit the amount of interchange fee income that can be received for electronic debit transactions, and we currently believe the impact of this rule may decrease our interchange revenue by about 50%, or approximately $45 million to $50 million per quarter. We continue to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximately $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Regulation E and rules related to debit card interchange fees. However, these mitigating actions are not expected to impact 76revenue until late 2012 and 2013, and inherent in this expectation is our ability to charge certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide. See additional discussion in the “Noninterest Income” section of this MD&A. The work required to comply with the Federal Reserve’s Consent Order is continuing. We currently anticipate modest increases in certain expenses, namely personnel and consulting, as we implement and comply with the provisions of the Consent Order. We are actively evaluating other proposed rules and regulations, and as they emerge from the various stages of implementation and promulgation, we expect to be in a position to comply with new requirements and take appropriate actions as warranted. See additional discussion related to the Consent Order in Note 14, "Contingencies", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and in the "Nonperforming Assets" section of this MD&A.CapitalDuring the first quarter of 2011, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR for the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. Upon completion of their review, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted. As a result, we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan, including issuing $1.0 billion of common stock and $1.0 billion of senior debt. In addition, we used the proceeds from those offerings, as well as other available funds, to repurchase $3.5 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C and $1.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP in November and December, 2008. The repurchase of the preferred stock will eliminate approximately $265 million in annual preferred dividend payments and discount accretion that has been negatively affecting our earnings the past two years. Additionally, by keeping our shareholders’ best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient and deliberate approach to TARP repayment, we believe that we successfully lessened the impact to our shareholders by issuing less common stock than what would have been required had we chosen to repay earlier.Our capital remained strong at September 30, 2011, and the level of common equity was significantly bolstered as a result of the successful common equity raise in the first quarter of 2011. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 9.31% compared to 8.08% at December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of the common equity raise. Meanwhile, as a result of the change in our equity mix due to the repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury and repurchase of trust preferred securities, as well as the impact of loan growth in risk-weighted assets, our Tier 1 capital ratio declined to 11.10%, compared to 13.67% at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 capital ratio, excluding TARP, was 10.08%. Our total capital ratio at September 30 was 13.91% compared to 16.54% at December 31, 2010. Overall, our capital remains well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards. Consistent with our desire to take actions that will positively benefit our shareholders, we made decisions during the quarter that increased the return of capital to our shareholders. First, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.05 per share. Second, when the U.S. Treasury auctioned our common stock warrants, we repurchased and retired approximately 4 million of the 17.9 million common stock warrants auctioned. With strong capital, ample liquidity, and improved earnings, we believe that we are well-positioned for long-term growth. See additional discussion of our liquidity and capital position in the “Liquidity Risk” and “Capital Resources” sections of this MD&A.Financial performanceContinuing to build on the positive momentum achieved during the first half of 2011, our net income and EPS improved during the third quarter. Our continued focus on serving our clients and managing our core business to drive improved bottom line results, together with improved credit quality, resulted in net income available to common shareholders during the current quarter of $211 million, or $0.39 per average common diluted share, which compares favorably to the net income available to common shareholders of $84 million, or $0.17 per average common diluted share, during the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2011 results were improved over the same period in 2010 due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses, higher net interest income, and the absence of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury. Net income available to common shareholders also improved compared to the second quarter’s results of $174 million and the first quarter's results of $38 million. The current quarter’s results, when compared to the prior quarter, were driven by a lower provision for credit losses. Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $424 million compared to a loss of $201 million during the same period in 2010. The improvement during the nine month period is primarily related to lower provision for credit losses, higher total revenue, and a reduction in preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2011, improved credit quality resulted in the decreases of 44% and 45%, respectively, in our provision for credit losses compared to the same periods in the prior year and were a significant driver of the increase in our net income available to common shareholders. As credit quality continues to improve, the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods. As we look towards the future, we continue to invest in teammate engagement, client loyalty, and growth in primary relationships that we believe will drive market share growth and, ultimately, higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders.77Our asset quality metrics improved this quarter, primarily due to favorable trends in the Commercial loan portfolio, with improvements in the provision for loan losses, net charge-offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets, and early stage delinquencies. At September 30, 2011, the ALLL remains elevated by historical standards at 2.22% of total loans but declined 36 basis points compared to December 31, 2010, in part due to a $374 million decrease in the ALLL, and declined by 18 basis points since the second quarter of 2011. The improvement in credit quality drove a 12% and 44% decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to the second quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010, respectively. Additionally, net charge-offs declined 3% and 29% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2010. We currently expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable during the fourth quarter, as compared to third quarter net charge-off levels. Total NPLs continued the downward trend seen during 2010 and early 2011, with a decline of 21% from December 31, 2010 as a result of reduced inflows into nonaccrual and our problem loan resolution efforts. NPLs are also down 10% compared to the second quarter of 2011. We expect additional NPL declines in the fourth quarter, subject to economic conditions and credit quality trends remaining stable or improving from conditions seen during the third quarter. OREO increased 5% during the quarter and decreased 15% since year end. The increase during the quarter was a result of an increase in commercial property inventory due to the migration of nonperforming loans through the workout process. The decline since year end was the result of disposition of properties once we had clear title, coupled with a slow down of inflows during the year. Our accruing restructured loan portfolio, which is primarily mortgage and consumer loans, increased by 8% compared to December 31, 2010. However, the portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 86% current on principal and interest payments at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Nonperforming Assets,” and “Restructured Loans,” sections of this MD&A.Mortgage repurchase demands remained elevated during the quarter, with the largest component continuing to be from the 2007 vintage. Almost all of the demands in the current quarter were consistent with prior quarters trends, with the majority being agency-related. We believe that demands will continue to be volatile and may remain elevated in the fourth quarter. As a result, our mortgage repurchase reserve remains at levels relatively consistent with prior quarters. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 13, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, the "Noninterest Income" section of this MD&A, and "Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q.Average loans increased by $1 billion, or 1%, during the quarter compared to both the second quarter of 2011 and to the fourth quarter of 2010, with increases in commercial & industrial and consumer loans being partially offset by decreases in certain commercial real estate, commercial construction, and residential real estate categories. Even though the total average loan balances have only increased modestly, our risk profile continues to improve as a result of the decline in certain higher-risk loan portfolios, which have been offset by targeted growth in certain lower-risk portfolios such as government-guaranteed loans, which represent 8% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2011. Despite continued soft loan demand, we remain focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers during this uncertain economic landscape. To that end, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we extended approximately $60 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients.Client deposit growth continued its positive trajectory, reaching another record high in the third quarter after reaching the previous high in the second quarter, and the positive shift in deposit mix continued with lower-cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher-cost deposits. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% during the third quarter and 3% since the fourth quarter of 2010. Average balance increases were driven by increases in lower cost noninterest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by declines in higher cost CDs. Due to the growth seen in core deposits, our liquidity has been enhanced, enabling us to reduce our higher-cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our funding costs. While we continue to believe that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients’ desires for having increased liquidity, we believe that we’ve also proactively driven this growth in both our Consumer and Wholesale business, as we’ve expanded the number of primary client relationships and improved our client loyalty.Our client-focused revenue generation strategies, lower cost funding mix, and improved asset quality contributed to improved operating trends as seen in higher net interest income and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses compared to a year ago. Total revenue, on an FTE basis, declined 5% compared to the third quarter of 2010 and increased 3% for the first nine months of 2011, in comparison to the first nine months of 2010. The change in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a decline in noninterest income as a result of lower mortgage-related income and lower securities gains. The increase in the nine month period was due primarily to an expanded net interest margin that was driven by a slight decrease in interest income that was overcome by a larger decrease in interest expense. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, increased 2% and 5%, in the first three and nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010. The increase in net interest income compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower funding costs and an improved funding mix. As a result, our net interest margin increased to 3.49% for the three months ended September 30, 2011 from 3.41% during the same period in 2010, and to 3.52% from 3.35% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. Noninterest income declined 14% 78compared to the same quarter in 2010, most notably due to decreases in securities gains and lower mortgage-related income, partially offset by higher trading income driven by higher valuation gains on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs. Compared to the first nine months of 2010, noninterest income was essentially unchanged in 2011, with increases in trading income, card fees, trust income, and investment banking income offset by lower securities gains and mortgage-related income. Noninterest income decreased 1% compared to the second quarter, driven by lower securities gains and a decline in investment banking income due to lower transaction volume in light of market volatility, following strong results in the second quarter. This was partially offset by an increase in mortgage production income as a result of increased origination volume as well as wider margins that were partially offset by higher mortgage repurchase provision. Noninterest expense increased 4% during the current quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2010, driven primarily by higher personnel costs, operating losses, and regulatory costs, partially offset by gains on debt extinguishment. Compared to the first nine months of 2010, noninterest expense increased by 5% primarily due to the same factors as the three month period. The higher personnel costs are due to the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in loss mitigation and in client service and support roles, and an increase in compensation as a result of improved revenue generation in certain businesses. The increase in the operating losses was due to increases in legal and mortgage servicing-related accruals, and regulatory cost increases were due to the change in the FDIC assessment methodology. Noninterest expense increased 1% compared to the second quarter due to mortgage-related costs, with operating losses and credit and collections expense driving the increase. See additional discussion of our financial performance in the “Consolidated Financial Results” section of this MD&A.Our results have improved and progress is being made for further improvement, but our performance is not where we would like for it to be, and therefore we announced specific initiatives that are aimed at improving our performance in the future. Our Playbook for Profitable Growth ("PPG") is the collection of initiatives across the organization that we believe will improve efficiency and over time will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to targeted levels below 60%, along with the expected normalization in credit-related expense and mortgage repurchase provision as the economic environment improves. The three main components of the PPG expense program are focused in the areas of strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies, and operations staff and support. We have made significant progress in our planning for PPG and implementation is underway on many of its initiatives. As a result of PPG, we are targeting $300 million in annual expense savings, with a majority of the actions to be accomplished during 2012 and the remainder in 2013. Only a small portion of the savings will be realized in 2011. 79SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA      Table 1 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions, except per share data)2011  2010  2011  2010 Summary of Operations       Interest income$1,538 $1,604 $4,638 $4,747Interest expense275 366 867 1,160Net interest income1,263 1,238 3,771 3,587Provision for credit losses347 615 1,186 2,138Net interest income after provision for credit losses916 623 2,585 1,449Noninterest income903 1,047 2,698 2,697Noninterest expense1,560 1,499 4,567 4,362Net income/(loss) before provision/(benefit) for income taxes259 171 716 (216)Net (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interest(1) 4 7 9Provision/(benefit) for income taxes45 14 136 (230)Net income$215 $153 $573 $5Net income/(loss) available to common shareholders$211 $84 $424 ($201)        Net interest income -

The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $84 million and $89 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively.3Accruing TDRs were classified in nonaccruals during prior periods. Due to sustained performance, accruing TDRs have been reclassified to the applicable loans category where the related interest income is being classified for all periods presented.4Derivative instruments that manage our interest-sensitivity position increased net interest income $476 million and $457 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively.5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.83Net Interest Income/MarginThird Quarter of 2011Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $27 million, or 2%, from the third quarter of 2010. This increase was driven primarily by a continued positive trend in net interest margin, which increased 8 basis points to 3.49% in the third quarter of 2011 from 3.41% in the third quarter of 2010. Earning asset yields declined 17 basis points compared to third quarter 2010, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 29 basis points over the same period. Net interest margin increased primarily due to the growth in lower-cost deposits, specifically demand deposit and money market accounts, and the decrease in higher-cost time deposits and long-term debt. We currently expect the net interest margin to decline in the fourth quarter of 2011 by a similar amount to the 4 basis point decline experienced in the prior quarter, as earning asset yield compression is expected as a result of the continued low rate environment.Average earning assets decreased $413 million, or less than 1%, compared to the third quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average securities AFS of $2.0 billion, or 8%, due primarily to the sale of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities of $5.3 billion, primarily offset by purchases of agency MBS and federal agency securities. See additional discussion in the “Securities Available for Sale” section in this MD&A for more information on the repositioning of our securities AFS portfolio. LHFS also declined $1.2 billion, or 38%, as a result of a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase in average loans of $2.3 billion, or 2%, compared to the third quarter of 2010. The increase in loans was primarily attributable to increases of $4.2 billion, or 13%, in commercial loans, primarily driven by our large corporate borrowers, $2.0 billion, or 26%, in consumer-indirect loans, driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios, and $1.2 billion, or 21%, of consumer-direct loans related to an increase in government-guaranteed student loans. These increases were partially offset by declines of $1.5 billion, or 11%, in commercial real estate and $1.5 billion, or 43%, of real estate construction, both primarily as a result of our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these loan types, and a $1.1 billion, or 24%, decline in nonaccrual loans. Our loan portfolio yielded 4.54% for the third quarter, down 20 basis points from third quarter 2010. The yield decline was primarily related to an increase in the consumer-indirect loan portfolio that included lower rate loans, and a decrease in real estate 1-4 family loans, which was driven by run-off of higher rate loans that we replaced with lower rate government guaranteed loans. Since a large percentage of our commercial loans are variable rate indexed to one month LIBOR, we utilize receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2011, the outstanding notional balance of swaps was $15.9 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared to $16.4 billion as of September 30, 2010. Swap income remained relatively stable at $159 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $153 million in the third quarter of 2010. Reflected in our quarterly swap income is approximately $55 million of interest income related to terminated swaps, which we anticipate will decline to approximately $20 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter of 2012. In addition, the U.S. government recently announced a plan that could potentially impact prepayments and borrower payment caps related to a portion of our student loan portfolio. Some of our portfolio was acquired at a discount and prepayments may result in additional net interest income; however, the impact of the plan is not expected to have a material effect on our net interest income.Average interest-bearing liabilities declined $2.4 billion, or 2%, from the third quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of significant declines in higher cost time deposits. Total average consumer and commercial deposits increased $5.7 billion, or 5%, in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. This growth consisted of lower-cost deposits, including $3.3 billion, or 8%, in money market accounts, and $5.4 billion, or 20%, in demand deposits, partially offset by a decline of $4.0 billion, or 17%, in higher-cost time deposits. This growth in lower-cost deposits was the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing and clients’ increased preference for more liquid products. The growth in lower-cost deposits and the decline in higher-cost deposits and wholesale funding resulted in a 29 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the same quarter in the prior year.During the third quarter of 2011, the interest rate environment was characterized by lower long-term rates compared to short-term rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve versus the third quarter of 2010. More specifically, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25%, unchanged from third quarter 2010. The Prime rate averaged 3.25%, unchanged from third quarter 2010. During the current quarter, benchmark rates were as follows compared to the third quarter of 2010; one-month LIBOR averaged 0.21%, a decrease of 8 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.30%, a decrease of 9 basis points, five-year swaps averaged 1.44%, a decrease of 32 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 2.56%, a decrease of 22 basis points.First Nine Months of 2011For the first nine months of 2011, net interest income was $3.9 billion, an increase of $179 million, or 5%, from the first nine months of 2010. Although total average earning assets were relatively unchanged, significant changes in the components occurred. Average loans increased $1.7 billion, or 1%, due to increases of $2.6 billion, or 8%, in commercial loans, $2.4 billion, or 34%, in consumer indirect 84loans, and $1.3 billion, or 24%, in consumer direct loans. These increases in average loans were offset by a $1.7 billion, or 11%, decrease in commercial real estate loans, a $1.4 billion, or 39%, decrease in real estate construction, and a $1.2 billion, or 25%, decrease in average nonaccrual loans. Average securities AFS decreased $1.3 billion, or 5%, and average LHFS declined $1.0 billion, or 31%. The average balance decrease in the securities portfolio was primarily attributable to a $2.7 billion reduction in U.S. Treasury securities and federal agency securities, partially offset by an increase in agency MBS securities. The factors for the remaining year-over-year changes were the same as those discussed related to the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2011.Interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $2.4 billion, or 2%, primarily driven by the $2.7 billion, or 17%, decline in long-term debt. However, average consumer and commercial deposits increased $5.6 billion, or 5%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2010. The increase was driven by a $4.5 billion, or 18%, increase in demand deposits. Additionally, a $4.9 billion, or 13%, increase in money market accounts was partially offset by a decrease of $4.3 billion, or 18%, in time deposits. Factors affecting the year-over-year changes were the same as those discussed related to the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2011.Consistent with the positive trend previously discussed, the net interest margin increased by 17 basis points from the nine months ended September 30, 2010 to the same period in 2011. Yields on average earning assets declined 10 basis points from 4.41% for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 to 4.31% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The average yield on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was 4.63%, down 13 basis points from the same period in 2010. The factors in the year-over-year decrease were the same as those discussed above related to the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Partially offsetting the decline in the average yield on loans was the average yield on securities AFS, which increased 5 basis points to 3.30% as a result of reduced holdings of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities and increased holdings of higher yielding MBS securities over the last nine months. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities over the same period decreased 31 basis points, due primarily to the 27 basis point decline in consumer and commercial deposits, which resulted from the declining interest rate environment and the change in deposit mix.Foregone InterestForegone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by 14 basis points for the third quarter of 2011 and 15 basis points for the first nine months of 2011, compared to 19 basis points and 22 basis points during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, as average nonaccrual loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 24%, and $1.2 billion, or 25%, during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively. See additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the “Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.85Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income decreased by $144 million, or 14%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, due to lower net gains on the sale of investment securities, a decline in investment banking income, and lower mortgage-related income, partially offset by higher trading account profits, retail investment services income, trust and investment management income, and card fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, noninterest income remained stable, as double digit growth in core consumer and commercial fee categories such as investment banking, card fees, and retail investment services was offset by lower mortgage-related income, as well as lower deposit service charges due to Regulation E and net securities gains from the sale of investment securities.Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $8 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $79 million, or 13%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decreases were attributable to Regulation E changes and a voluntary decision to eliminate fees on transactions where the overdrafted amount is small, as well as reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees charged to our clients. The voluntary changes and the Regulation E impact began during the third quarter of 2010.Card fees increased by $8 million, or 8%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $32 million, or 12%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases were primarily due to an increase in debit card interchange transactions. Growth was driven by household expansion, higher product penetration, and increasing consumer usage patterns. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing revised standards that significantly lowered the rates that can be charged on debit card transactions and prohibited network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. We estimate that this rule, when it becomes effective in the fourth quarter, will reduce our debit interchange income by about 50% or $45 million to $50 million per quarter prior to any mitigating actions. As a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue, we have introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients’ needs and which we expect will provide additional streams of fee income. Additionally, we will also benefit from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs and plan to add other value-added checking account features that, over time, we expect will produce additional deposit fee income. Collectively, and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all of these changes will enable us to recapture 50% of the approximate $300 million of combined annual revenue loss attributable to both the newly-issued interchange fee rules and Regulation E. Inherent in this expectation is our ability to charge certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide.Trust and investment management income increased by $10 million, or 8%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $31 million, or 8%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases were primarily due to higher revenue from our RidgeWorth mutual fund complex and higher market valuations on managed equity assets.Retail investment services income increased by $6 million, or 12%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $28 million, or 19%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases were driven by higher recurring brokerage revenue and annuity income.Mortgage production related income decreased $79 million, or 59%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010 and by $30 million, or 35%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The declines were primarily due to a decrease in refinance volume. The mortgage repurchase provision for the third quarter 2011 was $117 million compared to $95 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the three month period was a result of higher agency-related repurchase requests. Conversely, the repurchase provision declined to $287 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to $371 million in the same nine month period in 2010 in anticipation of higher repurchase requests in 2011, which also resulted in an increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Reserves for mortgage repurchases were $282 million as of September 30, 2011, a decrease of $17 million from prior quarter, reflective of the increase in resolutions during the third quarter of 2011. Repurchase requests can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of requests from the GSEs. Requests were elevated in the third quarter, which is a trend that may continue through the fourth quarter and may increase compared to third quarter levels. Should this trend continue, we may see an increase in the repurchase provision, which would result in lower mortgage production income as further discussed in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 13, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, the "Executive Overview" section of this MD&A, and "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q.Mortgage servicing related income decreased by $74 million, or 56%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $88 million, or 30%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decreases for the three and nine months were primarily due to a decrease in net MSR hedge performance. See the “Other Market Risk” section of this MD&A for further information regarding the risks pertaining to the valuation of our MSRs. The remaining decrease is due to a decline in service fees attributable to a decrease in 86the servicing portfolio. At September 30, 2011, the balance of mortgages serviced was $161.0 billion compared to $176.6 billion as of September 30, 2010.Investment banking income decreased by $28 million, or 29%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and increased by $21 million, or 10%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decline in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter was partially due to strong prior year results, coupled with challenging market conditions and decreased transaction volume during the current quarter. The increase for the nine months was primarily attributable to strong syndicated finance fees, which resulted from continued market penetration. We note that investment banking income has and will continue to experience volatility due to market factors and client behavior patterns.Trading account profits and commissions increased by $88 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $91 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to valuation gains on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs of $78 million in the third quarter of 2011 due to wider debt spreads compared to valuation losses of $81 million in the third quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by declines in fair market value adjustments on illiquid securities and previously securitized loans, as well as a decline in core trading income, which was impacted by volatile markets during the quarter.Net securities gains decreased by $67 million, or 97%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010 and by $30 million, or 23%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. In 2011 and 2010, we repositioned the securities AFS portfolio in response to market conditions, which caused sales and the resulting gains. See “Securities Available for Sale” in this MD&A for further discussion regarding our repositioning activity.Other noninterest income increased by $7 million, or 15%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $38 million, or 32%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to current year gains on private equity investments and client leasing transactions.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.87Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense increased by $61 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $205 million, or 5%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases were driven primarily by a rise in personnel expenses associated with improved revenue generation in certain businesses, as well as the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in client-facing and mortgage loss mitigation and servicing roles. Also contributing to the increases in noninterest expense were higher operating losses, largely attributable to mortgage servicing, and increases in regulatory assessment expenses partially offset by gains on the extinguishment of debt.Personnel expenses increased by $41 million, or 6%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $169 million, or 8%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases in personnel expenses were attributable to higher compensation related to improved business performance and the previously mentioned increases in full-time equivalent employees. Regulatory assessments expense increased by $13 million, or 19%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $35 million, or 18%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases were the result of the change in the assessment base for FDIC insurance premiums that took effect at the beginning of the second quarter of 2011.Operating losses increased by $45 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $104 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increase was due to higher legal and compliance-related costs largely attributable to mortgage servicing.Credit and collection services expense increased by $2 million, or 3%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, but decreased by $26 million, or 13%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decrease for the nine months was primarily due to lower residential mortgage and commercial real estate collections expense and lower mortgage loan closing costs in conjunction with the decline in mortgage loan production. Other real estate expense decreased by $16 million, or 21%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $15 million, or 7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Over time, as the economic environment improves, we expect that other real estate expenses will improve, but will likely remain elevated compared to the levels realized prior to the economic recession.Consulting and legal expenses increased by $14 million, or 70%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $25 million, or 48%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increases were attributable to consulting costs associated with specific business initiatives, as well as costs to address the Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. For additional information regarding the Consent Order, see Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.Other expense decreased by $29 million, or 25%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010, and by $46 million, or 15%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decreases were primarily attributable to lower legal-related expenses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the provision for income taxes was $45 million and $136 million, respectively, compared to a provision of $14 million and a benefit of $230 million for the same periods in 2010, respectively. The provision represents a 17.3% and 19.2% effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, compared to a 8.3% and (102.1)% effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively. We calculated income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 based on actual year-to-date results. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the effective tax rate was primarily a result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was also impacted by $13 million of net unfavorable discrete items. For the three months ended September 30, 2010, the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items as discussed for the 2011 periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the pre-tax loss as well as the aforementioned favorable permanent tax items. See additional discussion related to the provision for income taxes in Note 9, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.88In determining whether a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is necessary, we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax law, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. The cumulative valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset for certain state carryforwards was $52 million and $50 million as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. We expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryback period or in future years. Therefore, no valuation allowance is required against federal deferred tax assets or the remaining state deferred tax assets. On a consolidated basis, we estimate that we have a net deferred tax liability at September 30, 2011.LOANSWe report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, or classes, which further identify loans based upon common risk characteristics.The commercial and industrial class includes loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards and other wholesale lending activities. Loans that are reported in the commercial real estate and commercial construction classes are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate.Residential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans. Residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first-lien or junior-lien position. At September 30, 2011, 29% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 71% were in a junior lien position. For home equity products in a junior lien position, we service 32% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product.The classes comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct, consisting primarily of nonguaranteed student loans, indirect, consisting of loans secured by automobiles or recreational vehicles, and credit cards.Loan Portfolio by Types of Loans    Table 5(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010 % ChangeCommercial loans:     Commercial & industrial1$47,985 $44,753 7 %Commercial real estate5,330 6,167 (14)Commercial construction1,390 2,568 (46)Total commercial loans54,705 53,488 2Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - guaranteed4,449 4,520 (2)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed223,517 23,959 (2)Home equity products15,980 16,751 (5)Residential construction1,046 1,291 (19)Total residential loans44,992 46,521 (3)Consumer loans:     Guaranteed student loans5,333 4,260 25Other direct1,945 1,722 13Indirect10,003 9,499 5Credit cards497 485 2Total consumer loans 17,778 15,966 11LHFI$117,475 $115,975 1 %LHFS$2,243 $3,501 (36)%1Includes $3 million and $4 million of loans carried at fair value at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.2Includes $449 million and $488 million of loans carried at fair value at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.89Loans Held for InvestmentLHFI increased by $1.5 billion, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. We continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio, as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further managing down our residential real estate exposure. We believe that the reduction in loans that we consider to be higher risk and the growth in specific commercial and consumer loans constitutes a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. For example, we continued to manage down the commercial and residential construction portfolios, which declined by a combined $1.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and are down by $7.5 billion since the end of 2008. At the same time that we have been managing these and other higher risk balances down, we have also been reducing our risk by increasing our government-guaranteed loans. Government-guaranteed loans increased this quarter by about $650 million, and they now total $9.8 billion, or 8% of our loan portfolio.Commercial loans increased by $1.2 billion, or 2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was largely attributable to increases in commercial and industrial loans, largely offset by decreases in commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans. Commercial and industrial loans grew by $3.2 billion, or 7%, primarily driven by our larger corporate borrowers; the increase was across multiple industries, mainly in the form of increased term funding. Meanwhile, commercial construction loans decreased by $1.2 billion or 46%, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure and significantly limiting new production under tighter underwriting standards.Residential loans decreased by $1.5 billion, or 3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, with declines across all the residential loan classes, especially home equity and residential construction. Payments and payoffs, as well as transfers to OREO and current year net charge-offs, were the primary drivers for the overall decline.Consumer loans increased by $1.8 billion, or 11%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $1.1 billion, or 25%, increase in guaranteed student loans and a $504 million, or 5%, increase in indirect loans.Loans Held for SaleLHFS decreased by $1.3 billion, or 36%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decline was attributable to a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume. While mortgage interest rates declined during the third quarter of 2011, resulting in higher applications and interest rate locks, there was insufficient time for that activity to translate into higher LHFS by September 30, 2011.Asset QualityDuring the third quarter all of our primary asset quality metrics continued to improve, largely due to favorable trends in our commercial loans. Specifically, early stage delinquencies have declined 14 basis points since year end and 20 basis points when excluding government guaranteed loan delinquencies. The commercial and consumer delinquencies are 0.15% and 0.67% of total loans at September 30, 2011, respectively, and are at relatively low levels, while residential delinquencies have remained stable at 1.45%. Any further improvement in overall delinquencies will be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment and to a lesser extent, home values. Commercial charge-offs remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter, as an increase in commercial construction was largely offset by decreases in our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios. We continue to believe that our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios will perform comparatively well given their composition, the quality of our underwriting, and our ongoing management disciplines. Given the stresses in the commercial real estate market, we have performed a thorough analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with our client to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client’s financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the client’s and guarantor’s, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes.Commercial NPLs declined this quarter across all loan types. Commercial construction NPLs declined again this quarter as a result of continuing risk mitigation activities. We continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. For example, we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrowers' capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific 90projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding.Overall asset quality trends for residential loans were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. Net charge-offs in the residential mortgages portfolio declined modestly during the third quarter while early stage delinquencies and NPLs were relatively stable. Net charge-offs for the home equity portfolio declined during the quarter, while early stage delinquencies and NPLs remained stable compared to the second quarter of 2011. Runoff in this portfolio has been concentrated in the higher loan to value categories, where no new production has occurred and little to no line availability exists.The residential construction portfolio, which is primarily comprised of lot and land loans to individuals, showed a decline in terms of NPLs and net charge-offs, while experiencing another quarter of declines in early stage delinquencies. For the consumer portfolios, asset quality was stable to modestly improved. Early stage delinquencies, excluding guaranteed student loans, remained stable during the quarter. Meanwhile, the level of nonperforming consumer loans and net charge-offs remained relatively stable compared to the second quarter of 2011.We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 3, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.The following table shows the percentage breakdown of our total LHFI portfolio at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 by geographic region.Loan Types by Geography         Table 6 Commercial Residential Consumer  September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010  September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010  September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Geography:           Central127% 29% 21% 20% 15% 14%Florida220 21 28 29 19 21MidAtlantic326 28 36 35 27 27 Other27 22 15 16 39 38Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%1The Central region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.2The Florida region includes Florida only.3The MidAtlantic region includes the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESAt September 30, 2011, the allowance for credit losses was $2.7 billion, which includes both the ALLL, as well as, the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience, is shown in the table below:91Summary of Credit Losses Experience        Table 7 Three Months EndedSeptember 30, % Change  Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, % Change (Dollars in millions)2011 2010 2011 2010 Allowance for Credit Losses           Balance - beginning of period$2,795 $3,216 (13)% $3,032 $3,235 (6)%Benefit for unfunded commitments(1) (5) (80) (8) (60) (87)Provision for loan losses:           Commercial loans86 186 (54) 318 671 (53)Residential loans236 392 (40) 810 1,406 (42)Consumer loans26 42 (38) 66 122 (46)Total provision for loan losses348 620 (44) 1,194 2,199 (46)Charge-offs:           Commercial loans(214) (251) (15) (619) (694) (11)Residential loans(282) (433) (35) (970) (1,511) (36)Consumer loans(40) (41) (2) (125) (150) (17)Total charge-offs(536) (725) (26) (1,714) (2,355) (27)Recoveries:           Commercial loans29 20 45 99 72 38Residential loans3 5 (40) 14 15 (7)Consumer loans12 10 20 33 35 (6)Total recoveries44 35 26 146 122 20Net charge-offs(492) (690) (29) (1,568) (2,233) (30)Balance - end of period$2,650 $3,141 (16)% $2,650 $3,141 (16)%Components:           ALLL$2,600 $3,086 (16)%      Unfunded commitments reserve150 55 (9)      Allowance for credit losses$2,650 $3,141 (16)%      Average loans$115,638 $113,322 2 % $115,242 $113,587 1 %Period-end loans outstanding117,475 115,055 2      Ratios:           Allowance to period-end loans2,3,42.22% 2.69% (17)%      Allowance to NPLs2,580.92 71.07 14      Allowance to net charge-offs (annualized)21.33x 1.13x 18      Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)1.69% 2.42% (30)% 1.82% 2.63% (31)%Provision for loan losses to average loans (annualized)1.19 2.17 (45) 1.38 2.59 (47)Recoveries to total charge-offs8.2 4.8 71 8.5 5.2 631The unfunded commitments reserve is separately recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.2This ratio is calculated using the ALLL.3$452 million and $480 million, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from period-end loans in the calculation.4Excluding government-guaranteed loans of $9.8 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively from period-end loans in the calculation results in ratios of 2.42% and 2.91%, respectively.5$26 million and $31 million, respectively, of NPLs carried at fair value were excluded from NPLs in the calculation.92Charge-offsNet charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2011 declined by $198 million, or 29%, versus the three months ended September 30, 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net charge-offs declined by $665 million, or 30%, versus the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decline in net charge-offs occurred across each segment of our loan portfolio and was particularly notable for residential loans. As a percentage of average loans, annualized net charge-offs were 1.69% and 2.42% during the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 1.82% and 2.63%, respectively. The improvements in these figures were the result of improved asset quality. We currently expect net charge-offs to be generally stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.Provision for Loan LossesFor the three months ended September 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses decreased by $272 million, or 44%, versus the three months ended September 30, 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses decreased by $1.0 billion, or 46%, versus the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was attributable to significantly lower net charge-offs and the decline in the ALLL resulting from improved credit quality.ALLL and Reserve for Unfunded CommitmentsThe allocation of our ALLL by loan segment is shown in the tables below: Allowance for Loan Losses by Loan Segment       Table 8 September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010(Dollars in millions)ALLL  Segment ALLL as a % of total ALLL Loan segment as a % of total loans  ALLL  Segment ALLL as a % of total ALLL Loan segment as a % of total loans Commercial loans$1,101 42% 47% $1,303 44% 46%Residential loans1,352 52 38 1,498 50 40Consumer loans147 6 15 173 6 14Total$2,600 100% 100% $2,974 100% 100%The ALLL decreased by $374 million, or 13%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, with commercial, residential, and consumer loans-related ALLL decreasing $202 million, $146 million, and $26 million, respectively. The decrease in ALLL was commensurate with the improved credit quality of each segment as evidenced by lower delinquency rates, reductions in higher-risk balances, and lower NPLs. Our risk profile continues to improve, as certain higher-risk loans continue to decline, while lower-risk government guaranteed loans represented 8% of the portfolio as of September 30, 2011. The variables most impacting the ALLL continue to be unemployment, residential real estate property values, and the variability and relative strength of the housing market. At this point in the cycle, we expect the ALLL to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality and overall economic conditions. As of September 30, 2011, the allowance to period-end loans ratio was 2.22%, down from 2.58% at December 31, 2010, consistent with our continued actions to reduce the risk of our loan portfolio during the period. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs improved to 80.92% as of September 30, 2011 from 72.86% as of December 31, 2010. The improvement in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $871 million decrease in NPLs partially offset by the decline in ALLL.The reserve for unfunded commitments was $50 million as of September 30, 2011, a decrease of $8 million, or 14%, compared to $58 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the reserve was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers.93NONPERFORMING ASSETS           Nonperforming Assets    Table 9(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2011  December 31, 2010  % Change Nonaccrual/NPLs:     Commercial loans      Commercial & industrial1$479 $584 (18)%Commercial real estate341 342 —Commercial construction385 961 (60)Total commercial NPLs1,205 1,887 (36)Residential loans     Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed21,417 1,543 (8)Home equity products340 355 (4)Residential construction250 290 (14)Total residential NPLs2,007 2,188 (8)Consumer loans     Other direct7 10 (30)Indirect20 25 (20)Total consumer NPLs27 35 (23)Total nonaccrual/NPLs3,239 4,110 (21)OREO3509 596 (15)Other repossessed assets15 52 (71) Total nonperforming assets$3,763 $4,758 (21)%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$1,824 $1,565 17 %TDRs:     Accruing restructured loans $2,824 $2,613 8 %Nonaccruing restructured loans4883 1,005 (12)Ratios:     NPLs to total loans2.76% 3.54%  Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO and other repossessed assets3.19 4.08  1Includes $3 million and $4 million of loans carried at fair value at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.2Includes $23 million and $24 million of loans carried at fair value at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.3Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $134 million and $195 million at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.4Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.Nonperforming assets decreased by $1.0 billion, or 21%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to an $871 million reduction in NPLs as a result of our problem loan resolution efforts. Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the U.S. housing market correction. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming assets portfolio. Overall, NPL declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial loans, as the higher-risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced, while the commercial and industrial loans have generally performed well. We expect the recent quarters' trends to continue resulting in additional declines in NPLs in the fourth quarter.Nonperforming LoansNonperforming commercial loans decreased by $682 million, or 36%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, driven by a $576 million decrease in commercial construction NPLs and a $105 million decrease in commercial and industrial NPLs. 94We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter; however, we continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate NPLs as we move through the current commercial real estate cycle, as well as some impact on residential loans related to mortgage loan repurchases from investors. See Note 13, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Nonperforming residential loans decreased by $181 million, or 8%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, primarily as a result of a $126 million decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs. The $126 million decrease was partially attributable to the reclassification of certain nonperforming residential mortgages as held for sale to reflect our intention to sell these mortgages. We recorded an incremental charge-off of $10 million in the first quarter in connection with the decision to transfer and sell these mortgages. Approximately $34 million of these reclassified NPLs were sold during the second quarter; the remaining $13 million were transferred back to LHFI as they were no longer deemed marketable for sale. The remaining decrease was attributable to lower inflows of NPLs and net charge-offs.Nonperforming consumer loans decreased by $8 million, or 23%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, primarily as a result of a $5 million decrease in indirect consumer NPLs. The decrease was driven by net charge-offs of existing nonperforming consumer loans during the year, largely offset by the migration of delinquent consumer loans to nonaccrual status.Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting. We recognized $7 million and $10 million of cash basis interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $25 million and $32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $58 million and $81 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $194 million and $266 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have been recognized.Other Nonperforming AssetsOREO decreased by $87 million, or 15%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decline consisted of a net $130 million decrease in residential homes, partially offset by a $29 million increase in commercial properties and a $14 million increase in residential construction related properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $474 million and $561 million, respectively, and net gains on sales of OREO of less than $1 million and net losses of $6 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves, primarily attributed to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Gains and losses on sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 35% and 45%, respectively, of OREO; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value, less costs to sell. Further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.Other repossessed assets decreased by $37 million, or 71%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was largely attributable to the sale of repossessed assets during the year.The majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency. Accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by $259 million, or 17%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, $228 million of which was attributable to guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans At September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $116 million and $84 million, respectively, of past due accruing loans were not guaranteed.At the end of 2010, we completed an internal review of STM’s residential foreclosure processes. In 2011, we continue to improve upon our processes as a result of our review. In addition, following the Federal Reserve's horizontal review of the nation’s largest mortgage loan servicers, including SunTrust, SunTrust and other servicers entered into Consent Orders with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and have filed a copy of it as an Exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and then make any appropriate remediation, reimbursement, or adjustment. Additionally, borrowers who had a residential foreclosure action pending during this two-year review period will be solicited through advertising and direct mailings to request a review by the independent consultant of their case if they believe they incurred a financial injury as a result of errors, misrepresentations or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process. These requirements prescribed by the Consent Order may result in additional delays in the foreclosure process at a time when the time required for foreclosure upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, continues to be elevated. These delays in the foreclosure process 95have adversely affected us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and by exposing us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. These delays have also resulted, in some cases, in an inability to meet certain investor foreclosure timelines for loans we service for others, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in the assessment of compensatory fees. Noninterest expenses in our Mortgage line of business have also increased in 2011 as a result of the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment, revise affidavit filings and make any other operational changes. Additionally, continued and evolving changes in the regulatory environment and industry standards have increased our default servicing costs. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales has increased, and this has resulted in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances, and has adversely impacted the collectability of such advances. Accordingly, additional delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our process enhancements, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes, could further increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. See additional discussion in Part II, Item IA, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q.Restructured LoansTo maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees, to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extension in terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms. Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as accruing TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will likely continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At September 30, 2011, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $393 million. See Note 3, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.The following table displays our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status at September 30, 2011. Loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled $62 million at September 30, 2011.Selected Residential TDR Data          Table 10 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$463 $53 $516 $19 $68 $87Term extension25 13 38 2 24 26Rate reduction and term extension1,666 309 1,975 64 449 513Other216 2 18 3 7 10Total$2,170 $377 $2,547 $88 $548 $6361TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.2Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.At September 30, 2011, our total TDR portfolio was $3.7 billion and was composed of $3.2 billion, or 86%, of residential loans (predominately first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $485 million, or 13%, of commercial loans (predominately income-producing properties), and $40 million, or 1%, of direct consumer loans.96Accruing TDRs increased by $211 million, or 8%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase in accruing TDRs was partly attributable to an increase in the number of loan modifications during the year and partly related to the adoption of new accounting guidance. Applying the new guidance, which required a review and evaluation of loan modifications completed since January 1, 2011, resulted in the identification of $93 million of additional TDRs as of July 1, 2011, which is the date the guidance became effective. Nonaccruing TDRs decreased by $122 million, or 12%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, primarily reflecting net charge-offs during the year, as well as returns of commercial TDRs to accrual status and repayments. See additional discussion in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", and Note 3, "Loans", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such interest income recorded was $29 million and $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $84 million and $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $40 million and $37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $116 million and $102 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, would have been recognized.SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUEThe following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. For a complete discussion of our fair value elections and the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments, refer to Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Trading Assets and Liabilities  Table 11(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Trading Assets   U.S. Treasury securities$209 $187Federal agency securities612 361U.S. states and political subdivisions77 123MBS - agency509 301MBS - private1 15CDO/CLO securities44 55ABS37 59Corporate and other debt securities445 743CP78 14Equity securities85 221Derivative contracts 12,505 2,743Trading loans1,686 1,353Total trading assets$6,288 $6,175    Trading Liabilities   U.S. Treasury securities$326 $439MBS - agency1 —Corporate and other debt securities211 398Equity securities14 —Derivative contracts 11,183 1,841Total trading liabilities$1,735 $2,6781 The current year amount is offset with cash collateral received from or deposited with derivative counterparties when the derivative contracts are subject to ISDA master netting arrangements. We made this change as of July 1, 2011 due to resolution during the quarter of certain operational limitations. This presentation is in accordance with applicable accounting standards and applied prospectively.97Trading Assets and LiabilitiesTrading assets increased $113 million, or 2%, since December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in federal agency securities, agency MBS, CP and trading loans due to normal business activity. The increase was offset by a decrease in corporate and other debt securities due to normal business activity, and a decrease in equity securities due primarily to issuer redemptions of ARS municipal fund preferred shares. Derivative assets increased $950 million primarily due to the increase in the fixed income portfolio driven by the declining interest rate environment. This increase was offset by $1.2 billion in cash collateral as a result of our decision, beginning on July 1, 2011, to offset the derivatives with the related collateral. See Note 11, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 12 , "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Certain illiquid securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007 from affiliates, which included SIVs that are collateralized by various domestic and foreign assets, residential MBS, including Alternative A-paper and subprime collateral, CDOs, and commercial loans, as well as senior interests retained from SunTrust-sponsored securitizations. During the first quarter of 2011, we recognized approximately $17 million in net market valuation gains related to these securities and received approximately $77 million in cash from sales and paydowns related to these securities, thereby eliminating our exposure to these distressed assets.The Company also purchased ARS primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 as a result of the FINRA investigation. See additional discussion related to FINRA’s ARS investigation in Note 14, “Contingencies.” The fair value of these ARS recorded in trading assets and included in Table 10 above declined to $43 million as of September 30, 2011 compared to $147 million as of December 31, 2010. The reduction was due primarily to issuer redemptions of preferred equity ARS, offset slightly by a gain in fair value of the ARS. The majority of these remaining ARS securities are CDOs collateralized by trust preferred bank debt.Trading liabilities decreased $943 million, or 35%, since December 31, 2010 due primarily to decreases in U.S. Treasury securities and corporate and other debt securities as a result of normal business activity. Derivative liabilities increased $478 million primarily due to the increase in the fixed income portfolio driven by the declining interest rate environment. This increase was offset by $1.1 billion in cash collateral as a result of our decision, beginning on July 1, 2011, to offset the derivatives with the related collateral. See Note 11, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 12, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Securities Available for Sale      Table 12 September 30, 2011(Dollars in millions)Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses FairValue U.S. Treasury securities$374 $12 $— $386Federal agency securities2,527 118 — 2,645U.S. states and political subdivisions471 21 2 490MBS - agency19,302 728 — 20,030MBS - private319 1 33 287CDO/CLO securities337 — 5 332ABS534 13 7 540Corporate and other debt securities53 2 1 54Coke common stock— 2,027 — 2,027Other equity securities1710 1 — 711Total securities AFS$24,627 $2,923 $48 $27,5021At September 30, 2011, other equity securities included the following securities at cost: $171 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $391 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and $148 million in mutual fund investments. 98 As of December 31, 2010(Dollars in millions)Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses FairValue U.S. Treasury securities$5,446 $115 $45 $5,516Federal agency securities1,883 19 7 1,895U.S. states and political subdivisions565 17 3 579MBS - agency14,014 372 28 14,358MBS - private378 3 34 347CDO/CLO securities50 — — 50ABS798 15 5 808Corporate and other debt securities464 19 1 482Coke common stock— 1,973 — 1,973Other equity securities1886 1 — 887Total securities AFS$24,484 $2,534 $123 $26,8951At December 31, 2010, other equity securities included the following securities at cost: $298 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $391 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and $197 million in mutual fund investments.Securities Available for SaleThe securities AFS portfolio is managed as part of our overall ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $27.5 billion as of September 30, 2011, an increase of $607 million, or 2%, versus December 31, 2010. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the nine months reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile. These changes included reducing the size of the U.S. Treasury securities portfolio by $5.1 billion, from which the proceeds were partly used to repurchase our Series C and Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock that we issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. The proceeds were also used to increase agency MBS and federal agency securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we recorded $98 million in net realized gains primarily from the sale of securities AFS as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio, compared to net realized gains of $128 million during the same period in 2010. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.At September 30, 2011, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.9 billion in net unrealized gains, comprised of a $2.0 billion unrealized gain from our 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $848 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.4 billion in net unrealized gains, which were comprised of a $2.0 billion unrealized gain from our 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $438 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. The net unrealized gain, excluding Coke, increased due to the decline in interest rates experienced during 2011. We entered into two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective July 15, 2008 with a major, unaffiliated financial institution (the “Counterparty”) collectively covering our 30 million Coke shares. Under The Agreements, we must deliver to the Counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of Coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares. The Counterparty is obligated to settle The Agreements for no less than $38.67 per share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the “Minimum Proceeds”). The Agreements give us the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the Counterparty, at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement, any of the 30 million Coke common shares that are not delivered to the Counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements. The Agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our 30 million Coke common shares at a price no less than $38.67 per share, while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the Coke common shares up to $66.02 per share and $65.72 per share, under each of the respective variable forward agreements. Additional details related to these forward agreements can be found in Note 11, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.For the three months ended September 30, 2011, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio increased to 3.33% compared to 3.32% for the three months ended September 30, 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio increased to 3.30% compared to 3.25% for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The yield increases were largely due to reduced holdings of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities and increased holdings of higher yielding agency MBS securities during 2011.The portfolio’s effective duration decreased to 2.2% as of September 30, 2011 from 3.3% as of December 31, 2010. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration 99embedded options. An effective duration of 2.2% suggests an expected price change of 2.2% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.The credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong at September 30, 2011 and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns.We expect the size of our securities portfolio to remain relatively stable in the near term. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. Accordingly, we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and/or declining deposits.BORROWINGS                               Short-term Borrowings              Table 13 As of September 30, 2011 Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2011(Dollars in millions)Balance  Rate  Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End  Daily Average MaximumOutstanding at any Month-End   Balance  Rate  Balance  Rate  Fed funds purchased 1$998 0.11% $1,069 0.11% $1,090 $1,061 0.14% $1,169Securities sold under agreement to repurchase 12,016 0.14 2,170 0.15 2,182 2,245 0.15 2,411Other short-term borrowings 23,218 0.34 3,063 0.40 3,218 2,920 0.40 3,218Total short-term borrowings$6,232   $6,302     $6,226       As of September 30, 2010 Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010(Dollars in millions)Balance Rate Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End    Balance Rate Balance Rate Fed funds purchased 1$1,076 0.21% $1,176 0.20% $1,186 $1,271 0.18% $3,163Securities sold under agreement to repurchase 12,429 0.15 2,505 0.16 2,554 2,375 0.14 2,794Other short-term borrowings 24,894 0.30 3,192 0.40 4,894 2,862 0.44 4,894Total short-term borrowings$8,399   $6,873     $6,508    1Fed funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of borrowings.2Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral held by the Company, U.S. Treasury demand notes, CP, short-term FHLB advances, and other short-term borrowed funds.Short-Term Borrowings Our period-end short-term borrowings decreased $2.2 billion, or 26%, from September 30, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in other short-term borrowings of $1.7 billion and a $413 million decline in securities sold under agreement to repurchase.Average short-term borrowings decreased by $571 million, or 8%, compared to the third quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily due to average decreases in securities sold under agreement to repurchase of $335 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, average short-term borrowings decreased by $282 million, or 4%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as a result of declines in average Fed funds purchased of $210 million.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, our period-end outstanding balances were not materially different from maximum monthly outstanding balances or from the daily averages for any category of short-term borrowings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, average Fed funds purchased had a significant difference between the maximum outstanding balance and the period ended balance, resulting from our temporary increase in borrowings during January 2010, which was part of our ordinary balance sheet management practices. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, average other short-term borrowing had a significant difference between the maximum outstanding balance and the period ended balance, resulting from a decrease of dealer collateral held by SunTrust.100Long-Term DebtDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2011, our long-term debt decreased by $104 million. The change was primarily due to the maturity and redemption of $852 million of our ten year 6.375% subordinated notes and our repurchase of $320 million of fixed rate senior and junior subordinated notes that were due in 2011 and 2036, offset by our issuance of $1.0 billion of five year 3.60% senior notes during the first quarter of 2011. Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2011, on October 27, 2011 we issued $750 million of 3.50% senior Parent Company notes that will mature in 2017.In September 2011, we conducted a consent solicitation from holders of our 6% subordinated notes due 2026 to terminate each of four replacement capital covenants executed by us in connection with various hybrid securities offerings. Under the terms of the replacement capital covenants, we could only repurchase, redeem or repay those covered hybrid securities if a specific portion of the funds used were the proceeds of the sale of equity or certain equity-like securities within a specified time period prior to such repurchase, redemption or repayment. We received the consent of the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the 6% subordinated notes due 2026 and, consequently, the termination of the replacement capital covenants became effective on September 23, 2011.CAPITAL RESOURCESOur primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures (risk weighted assets) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles.Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk weighted assets, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities.Both the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk weighted assets. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average assets, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.In September 2010, the BCBS announced new regulatory capital requirements (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements, through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements, new capital conservation buffers, and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure. Basel III would impose a new common equity requirement of 7%, comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The transition period for banks to meet the revised common equity requirement will begin in 2013, with full implementation in 2019. The BCBS has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional, counter-cyclical capital buffer on top of Basel III standards. The new rule also proposes the deduction of certain assets in measuring Tier 1 capital. It is anticipated that U.S. regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS. We monitor our capital structure as to compliance with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and take into account these new regulations as they are published and become applicable to us in our capital planning.101Capital Ratios  Table 14(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Tier 1 capital$14,531 $18,156Total capital18,211 21,967Risk-weighted assets130,952 132,819Tier 1 common equity:   Tier 1 capital14,531 18,156Less:   Qualifying trust preferred securities2,051 2,350Preferred stock172 4,942Allowable minority interest120 127Tier 1 common equity$12,188 $10,737Risk-based ratios:   Tier 1 common equity9.31% 8.08%Tier 1 capital11.10 13.67Total capital13.91 16.54Tier 1 leverage ratio8.90 10.94Total shareholders’ equity to assets11.71 13.38In March 2011, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR to evaluate capital plans of the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. As a result of the CCAR, some of the bank holding companies increased or reinstated dividends payments, common stock repurchases, or repaid U.S. government capital borrowed under the CPP. Upon completion of their review, the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the CCAR in December 2010. As such, during March 2011, we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan, including issuing $1.0 billion of common stock and $1.0 billion of senior debt. We then used the proceeds from those offerings, as well as other available funds, to repurchase $3.5 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C and $1.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP’s CPP. As a result of the repurchase of Series C and D Preferred Stock, we incurred a one-time, non-cash charge to net income available to common shareholders of $74 million related to accelerating the outstanding discount accretion on the Series C and D Preferred Stock. In September 2011, the U.S. Treasury sold, in a public auction, warrants to purchase 11.9 million shares of SunTrust common stock at an exercise price of $44.15 per share (Series B warrants) and 6 million shares of SunTrust common stock at an exercise price of $33.70 per share (Series A warrants). We had issued the warrants to the U.S. Treasury in connection with its investment in SunTrust Banks, Inc. under the CPP and the warrants have expiration dates of November 2018 (Series B) and December 2018 (Series A). In conjunction with the auction, we reacquired and retired 4 million of the Series A warrants for $11 million.During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, our common equity increased by $1.8 billion, primarily as a result of the common stock offering, net income, and an increase in AOCI due to higher unrealized gains primarily related to securities and derivatives. Conversely, total shareholders’ equity decreased by $2.9 billion from December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of the repurchase of the Series C and D Preferred Stock, partially offset by the issuance of the new common shares.Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital ratios were 9.31%, 11.10%, and 13.91%, respectively, at September 30, 2011 compared to 8.08%, 13.67%, and 16.54%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 Capital ratio excluding preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was 10.08%. The increase in Tier 1 common equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was the result of the issuance of common equity. The decline in Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios was due to the reduction in total equity as a result of the repurchase of the Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. Overall, our capital levels are strong at September 30, 2011 as we remain well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to the current U.S. regulatory standards, and our capital ratios exceed the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee under Basel III and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies.We declared and paid common dividends totaling $26 million during the three months ended September 30, 2011, or $0.05 per common share, compared to $5 million, or $0.01 per common share, during the same period in 2010. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $37 million, or $0.07 per common share, compared to $15 million, or $0.03 per common share during the same period in 2010. Additionally, we declared dividends payable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 of approximately $2 million and $5 million, and $2 million and $6 million, respectively, on our Series A Preferred Stock. Further, during the three and nine months ended 102September 30, 2010, we declared dividends payable of $61 million and $182 million, respectively, and during the first quarter of 2011, we declared dividends of $60 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock. Following the repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the CPP, on August 9, 2011, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share, which was paid on September 15, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 1, 2011. However, we remain subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase our dividend. See Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional considerations regarding the level of future dividends. Additionally, limits exist on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. There was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations at September 30, 2011.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThere have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies section as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010; however, we have updated our discussion of Goodwill to incorporate our annual impairment test assumptions and results.GoodwillAs of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, our reporting units with goodwill balances are Branch Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CIB, and W&IM. Branch Banking is a component of the Retail Banking reportable segment. See Note 15, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our reportable segments.We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of September 30th, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. The goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions, as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities, and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time; however, supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions, adjusted to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions. Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of September 30, 2011, we determined there is no goodwill impairment as the fair value for all reporting units is in excess of the respective reporting unit's carrying value by the following percentages: Branch Banking12%Diversified Commercial Banking27%CIB36%W&IM150%Valuation TechniquesIn determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require assumptions about short and long-term net cash flow, growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. Additionally, we consider guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available, to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units.Growth AssumptionsMulti-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, client service and retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at 4% as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation.103Discount Rate AssumptionsDiscount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. In the annual analysis as of September 30, 2011, the discount rates ranged from 13% to 17%.Estimated Fair Value and SensitivitiesThe estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors, including current economic and market conditions, marketplace dynamics such as level of short selling, company-specific growth opportunities, and guideline company and guideline transaction information.Economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a company's stock price, resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization. In those circumstances, current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant's estimate of entity-specific value measured over a reasonable period of time. We believe that recent volatility may be tied to concerns related to a rating agency downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding the global economy, rather than the result of company-specific adjustments to cash flows, guideline multiples, or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of our reporting units. As a result, the use of market capitalization is a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units. Therefore, we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over a reasonable period.The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units.If there is a situation where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value, an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed that involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination.The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit's net assets. The fair value of the reporting unit's net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following:•recent data observed in the market, including similar assets,•cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates,•market indices,•estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, and•price indications from independent third parties.Observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant. The estimated fair values reflect management's assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit, liquidity, and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment.If the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill.ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTThere have been no significant changes to our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, except as discussed below.104Credit Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our credit risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.Operational Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet, which includes all loans (including variable rate loans) and any associated hedges. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities, investment portfolio, Coke common stock, MSRs, loan warehouse and pipeline, and debt and brokered deposits carried at fair value. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board.Market Risk from Non-Trading ActivitiesAs the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous 100 basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. Interest Rate Sensitivity from an Economic Perspective  Table 15 Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months(Basis points)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Rate Change   +100(0.2)% 0.2%-100(1.2)% (0.9)%The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits/(losses) and commissions from a financial reporting perspective.105Interest Rate Sensitivity from a Financial Reporting Perspective  Table 16 Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months(Basis points)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Rate Change   +1000.1% 0.5%-100(1.3)% (1.0)%The difference from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2011 seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to the +100 and -100 basis point shock scenarios is primarily due to an increase in liability sensitivity from projected balance sheet growth, funded with short-term borrowings.We also perform valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios.As of September 30, 2011, the MVE profile indicates changes with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. However, results at September 30, 2011 in the downward rate shock is significantly less meaningful than the upward rate shock. In a -100 shock scenario, current interest rate levels that are already at or near 0% are adversely impacting discounted cash flow analysis causing the short end of the discount curve to be zero bound and therefore, the shock behaves more like a curve flattener than a parallel shock. Market Value of Equity Sensitivity  Table 17 Estimated % Change in MVE(Basis points)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Rate Change   +100(2.9)% (3.4)%-1000.0% 1.1%While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.Market Risk from Trading ActivitiesUnder established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets, and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio. Our VAR calculation measures the potential losses using a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period. This means that, on average, losses are expected to exceed VAR two or three times per year. We had no backtest exceptions to our overall VAR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. The following table displays high, low, and average VAR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.106Value at Risk Profile      Table 18 For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30 For the Nine Months EndedSeptember 30(Dollars in millions)2011 2010 2011 2010Average VAR$5 $8 $5 $9High VAR$6 $9 $7 $13Low VAR$4 $7 $4 $7Average VAR during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 was lower compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to sales, paydowns, and maturities of illiquid trading assets. This is a result of continuing to manage down illiquid asset holdings where possible, as they are not part of our core business activities. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, averaged $4.1 billion and $3.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increases in average trading balances are primarily a result of an increase in the TRS portfolio and growth in fixed income trading, but partially offset by reductions in illiquid trading asset holdings. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, were $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity.The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. As of September 30, 2011, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $13.9 billion of free and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately 92% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a portfolio of publicly traded securities, although the Parent Company invested approximately $5 billion of cash in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities during 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 prior to retiring its TARP preferred securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital related) for an extended period of months in accordance with Company risk limits.We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. The table below presents period-end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. We believe these contingent liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs. 107Contingent Liquidity Sources   Table 19 September 30, 2011 September 30, 2010(Dollars in billions)As of  Average for theNine Months Ended ¹  As of  Average for theNine Months Ended ¹ Excess reserves$1.7 $3.0 $0.4 $2.4Free and liquid investment portfolio securities15.7 17.7 20.9 18.0FHLB borrowing capacity15.2 13.0 9.1 8.3Discount window borrowing capacity15.0 13.7 12.1 11.8Total$47.6 $47.4 $42.5 $40.51Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. Additionally, contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. As of September 30, 2011, Moody’s, S&P, and DBRS all maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings, while Fitch maintained a “Positive” outlook, citing improved credit and earnings trends. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the “Stable” and “Positive” credit rating outlooks.Debt Credit Ratings and Outlook      Table 20 As of September 30, 2011 Moody’s  S&P  Fitch  DBRS SunTrust Banks, Inc.

As of September 30, 2011, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. In the absence of robust loan demand, we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to purchase and retire certain high-cost debt securities or other borrowings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, pursuant to a capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve, we repurchased high-cost Tier 1 capital securities, including $4.9 billion of our Series C and Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP’s CPP and Trust Preferred Securities. Despite these transactions, the Parent Company retains a material cash position, in accordance with Company policies and risk limits discussed in greater detail below.Sources of Funds. Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, primarily gathered from our retail branch network, are our largest and most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits increased to $123.9 billion as of September 30, 2011, from $120.0 billion as of December 31, 2010.We also maintain access to a diversified collection of wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding slightly decreased to $21.5 billion as of September 30, 2011, from $22.9 billion as of December 31, 2010. Collectively, the Bank and Parent Company have approximately $3.2 billion of long-term wholesale funding maturing during the final quarter of 2011. Approximately $852 million of wholesale debt matured during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and was redeemed at par. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and Fed funds purchased, decreased to $6.0 billion as of September 30, 2011, from $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2010.108As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5 billion of such securities, of which approximately $2.2 billion of issuance capacity remains available. The most recent issuance from this shelf occurred on October 27, 2011, when we issued $750 million of 3.50% senior Parent Company notes due January 20, 2017. The Bank also maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of September 30, 2011, the Bank had $33.7 billion of remaining board authority to issue notes under the program. However, the Bank has no present intention of issuing notes under the program and intentionally allowed the program to expire. The Bank is in the process of renewing the program and once renewed, will have ability to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. During the third quarter of 2011, we had no Parent Company debt that matured, and none is scheduled to mature during the remainder of 2011. Approximately $1 billion of Parent Company debt is scheduled to mature in 2012. A majority of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances.Recent Developments. Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective, the potential impact of which cannot be presently quantified. However, we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and liquidity management practices. See discussion of certain current legislative and regulatory proposals within the “Executive Overview” section of this MD&A.Other Liquidity Considerations. As detailed in Table 21, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $61.0 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at September 30, 2011. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $5.5 billion in letters of credit as of September 30, 2011, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $3.3 billion of these letters as of September 30, 2011 supported variable rate demand obligations.As of September 30, 2011, our cumulative UTBs amounted to $99 million. The gross liability for interest related to UTBs was $21 million as of September 30, 2011. These UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions, and if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal operating cash flows, likely over multiple years.109Unfunded Lending Commitments  Table 21(Dollars in millions)September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010Unused lines of credit:   Commercial$35,129 $34,363 Mortgage commitments 17,226 9,159Home equity lines12,981 13,557Commercial real estate1,439 1,579CP conduit769 1,091Credit card3,478 3,561Total unused lines of credit$61,022 $63,310Letters of credit:   Financial standby$5,402 $6,263Performance standby72 108Commercial70 68Total letters of credit$5,544 $6,4391Includes $5.1 billion and $4.2 billion in IRLCs accounted for as derivatives as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.Other Market RiskExcept as discussed below, there have been no other significant changes to other market risk as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.MSRs, which are carried at fair value, totaled $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $47 million and $183 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $64 million and $198 million, respectively. We recorded decreases of $437 million and $582 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. We recorded decreases of $290 million and $811 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, respectively. Increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, we recorded losses related to MSRs of $40 million and $94 million (including decay of $46 million and $139 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, we recorded gains related to MSRs of $25 million and losses of $26 million (including decay of $49 million and $167 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. We continue to evaluate the impact that the Consent Order may have, and we currently do not expect the impact to be material unless third party price indications reflect lower market valuations.Recent changes to the U.S. Government's Making Homes Affordable Program will likely increase the number of borrowers that are eligible for mortgage refinance opportunities. We expect that prepayment rates for a portion of the loans in our servicing portfolio will increase and result in a decline in the value of our MSR asset in future quarters. Program terms, such as seller representations and warranties, will influence the impact on prepayment rates and those details have yet to be published.

Except as noted within the “Borrowings" section of this MD&A, there have been no significant changes in our Contractual Commitments as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.110BUSINESS SEGMENTSThe following table for our reportable business segments compares net income/(loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 to the same periods in 2010: Net Income/(Loss) by Segment      Table 22 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30(Dollars in millions)2011 2010 2011 2010Retail Banking$58 $36 $126 $73Diversified Commercial Banking76 63 202 151CRE(89) (114) (248) (241)CIB64 109 258 210Mortgage(138) (103) (451) (646)W&IM31 28 104 89Corporate Other and Treasury156 96 407 345Reconciling Items57 38 175 24The following table for our reportable business segments compares average loans and average deposits for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2011 to the same periods in 2010: Average Loans and Deposits by Segment      Table 23 Three Months Ended September 30 Average Loans Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits(Dollars in millions)2011 2010 2011 2010Retail Banking$35,397 $33,537 $77,112 $75,598Diversified Commercial Banking23,116 22,380 19,300 17,757CRE6,658 9,377 1,582 1,446CIB14,302 10,950 8,679 7,021Mortgage28,765 29,044 3,081 3,440W&IM7,258 7,852 12,315 11,228Corporate Other and Treasury142 182 905 743         Nine Months Ended September 30 Average Loans Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits 2011 2010 2011 2010Retail Banking$35,330 $33,053 $76,848 $75,056Diversified Commercial Banking22,985 22,722 19,210 18,469CRE7,314 10,111 1,513 1,602CIB13,084 10,713 8,264 6,522Mortgage28,966 28,864 2,920 2,881W&IM7,377 7,916 12,177 11,020Corporate Other and Treasury186 208 931 717See Note 15, “Business Segment Reporting,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our segment structure, basis of presentation and internal management reporting methodologies.111BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTSNine Months Ended September 30, 2011 vs. 2010Retail BankingRetail Banking reported net income of $126 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $53 million, or 73%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to lower provision for credit losses and higher net interest income that was partially offset by lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense.Net interest income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $27 million, or 1%, from the same period in 2010. The increase was driven by the benefits derived from higher average loan balances and spreads and higher average deposit balances partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. Average loan balances increased $2.3 billion, or 7%. Indirect consumer loans increased $2.4 billion, driven by organic indirect auto production and by the acquisition of $1.7 billion of consumer auto loans in the third and fourth quarters of 2010. Additional consumer loan growth was the result of the purchase of $1.4 billion of guaranteed student loans during the past twelve months. Partially offsetting those increases were decreases in home equity lines, residential mortgages, and commercial loans. Loan related net interest income increased $54 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year driven by increased loan volume and higher loan spreads.Average customer deposit balances increased $1.8 billion, or 2%. Favorable deposit mix trends continued as low cost average deposit balances increased, offsetting a $3.4 billion, or 16%, decline in average time deposits. Deposit-related net interest income decreased $40 million, or 3%, as the value of deposits fell in the current interest rate environment.Provision for credit losses was $593 million, a decrease of $172 million, or 22%, over the same period in 2010 primarily driven by declines of $75 million in home equity line, $33 million in commercial, $27 million in credit card, and $29 million in residential mortgage loan net charge-offs.Total noninterest income was $830 million, a decrease of $27 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2010. Service charges on deposits decreased $71 million, or 16%, driven by lower NSF/overdraft fees resulting from Regulation E changes. Those decreases were partially offset by higher interchange and ATM card fees, which increased a combined $40 million, or 12%, primarily due to increased transaction volume.Total noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, up $86 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by increases in other real estate and other shared corporate expenses primarily in technology and operational areas.Diversified Commercial BankingDiversified Commercial Banking reported net income of $202 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $51 million, or 34%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was attributable to a decrease in provision for credit losses and increases in net interest income.Net interest income was $532 million, a $44 million, or 9%, increase from the same period in 2010. Average loan balances were relatively flat to prior year, increasing $263 million or 1%, with increases in commercial domestic loans, tax-exempt loans and auto dealer floor plan loans, offset by decreases in leasing and commercial real estate loans. Loan-related net interest income increased $38 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2010 due to increased loan spreads. Average customer deposit balances increased $741 million, or 4%, from the same period in 2010. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as higher cost time deposits declined $446 million, or 36%, while lower cost commercial demand deposits increased $1.6 billion, or 24%. NOW and money market combined average balances decreased $372 million, or 3%. Provision for credit losses was $49 million, a decrease of $39 million, or 44%, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in commercial real estate loans, commercial domestic loans and lease financing.Total noninterest income was $191 million, an increase of $18 million, or 10%, from the prior year driven primarily by leasing revenue. Additional increases in card services fees, revenue share for capital market fees and nonmargin loan fees were offset by decreases in letter of credit fees, service charges on deposits and investment banking income.Total noninterest expense was $358 million, up $23 million, or 7%, from the prior year as lower other real estate expenses were offset with higher administrative overhead, operations, and staff expenses. 112Commercial Real Estate and Affordable HousingCRE reported a net loss of $248 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the net loss of $241 million for the same period in 2010. The increase in net loss was primarily due to higher provision expense. Net interest income was $106 million, an $18 million, or 15% decline from the same period in 2010. Average loan balances declined $2.8 billion, or 28%, largely due to a $2.3 billion decrease in commercial real estate loans. Loan related net interest income decreased $21 million, or 19%, as the decrease in average balances more than offset higher loan spreads. Average customer deposit balances declined $89 million, or 6%, driven by an $85 million decrease in money market accounts. Deposit related net interest income declined from prior year by $4 million, or 12%, attributable to declines in deposit spreads and volume.Provision for credit losses was $353 million, a $9 million, or 3%, increase over the same period in 2010. The increase was predominantly driven by higher net charge-offs related to residential land and investor owned real estate loans.Total noninterest income was $73 million, an increase of $12 million, or 20%, from the same period in 2010. The increase was the result of favorable sales and mark-to-market gains related to the GB&T loan portfolio carried at fair market value, and higher income related to Affordable Housing.Total noninterest expense was $316 million, a decrease of $8 million, or 2%, over the same period in 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by lower credit expenses, staff expense, and Affordable Housing-related expense. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher allocated administrative expenses.Corporate and Investment BankingCIB's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $258 million, an increase of $48 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was driven by higher total revenues and a decline in provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.Net interest income was $362 million, an increase of $89 million or 33% from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.4 billion, or 22%, increase in average loan balances. The increase in loan balances was largely the result of a $814 million increase in Three Pillars, the CP conduit, a $324 million increase in asset-based lending loans, additional increases in term loans, and an increase of line of credit utilization. The increase in average loan balances, as well as higher loan spreads, resulted in a $73 million, or 43%, increase in loan-related net interest income. Total average client deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 27%, with growth concentrated in demand deposits, NOW accounts, and money market accounts. Higher deposit volumes offset the impact of lower deposit spreads contributing $17 million to the overall increase in net interest income. Provision for loan losses was a benefit $1 million due to net recoveries of loans previously charged off as net charge-offs declined $38 million from the prior year. Lower net charge-offs related to large corporate borrowers operating in economically sensitive industries drove the decline. Total noninterest income was $477 million, an increase of $28 million, or 6%, over the prior year. The increase is primarily due to improved performance in loan syndications, equity underwritings, foreign exchange fees, and merchant banking gains as well as a decline in valuation losses associated with previously securitized loans.Total noninterest expense was $433 million, an increase of $81 million, or 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher staff expense related to increased revenue generation, higher operating losses impacted by increased legal-related expenses, as well as increased operation costs related to growth in loans and deposits.MortgageMortgage reported a net loss of $451 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, an improvement of $195 million, or 30% compared to the same period in 2010. The improvement was driven by lower provision for credit losses and repurchase provision that was partially offset by lower production income due to lower loan originations, less favorable net MSR hedge performance and higher expenses.Net interest income was $362 million, up $31 million, or 9% over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income on loans, which increased $43 million, or 22%, principally due to improved spreads. Total average loans, primarily residential mortgages were relatively consistent with prior year, increasing $102 million. The improvement in net interest income on loans was partially offset by lower deposit and other liability spreads resulting in a decline of $8.7 million, or 8%.113Provision for credit losses was $520 million, a decrease of $436 million, or 46%, from the same period in 2010. The decline was primarily driven by a $351 million decline in residential mortgage loan charge-offs as well as reductions in residential construction-to-perm net charge-offs. Net charge-offs included $10 million and $51 million of charge-offs related to NPL sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.Total noninterest income was $271 million, down $126 million, or 32%, compared with the same period in 2010. The decline was principally due to lower production income as a result of lower loan origination volume, partially offset by lower repurchase provision and less favorable net MSR hedge performance. Total production income of $42 million was down $28 million, or 40%. Loan originations were $16.2 billion for the first nine months of 2011, compared with $20.6 billion for the same period the prior year, a 21% decrease. Servicing income of $202 million declined $88 million, or 30%, due to less favorable net MSR hedge performance and lower service fees. Total loans serviced at September 30, 2011 were $161.0 billion compared to $176.6 billion at September 30, 2010, down 9%.Total noninterest expense was $847 million, an increase of $35 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher staff expense and an increase in legal and compliance-related costs, partially offset by lower OREO expenses.Wealth and Investment ManagementW&IM's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $104 million, an increase of $15 million, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher trust and retail investment income and net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income was $305 million, an increase of $25 million, or 9%, over the prior year driven mostly by deposit-related net interest income. Average customer deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 10%, as money market accounts increased $1.3 billion, or 36%, and average demand deposits increased $403 million, or 21%. Average time deposits decreased $464 million, or 32%, and NOW accounts decreased $122 million, or 3%. Deposit-related net interest income increased $23 million, or 13%, due to the combination of higher average balances and improved deposit spreads. Average loan balances declined $539 million, or 7%, with decreases primarily in consumer direct categories, commercial real estate, and residential mortgages. Additionally, higher loan spreads offset the decrease in average loan balances. Provision for credit losses was $54 million, an increase of $10 million, or 23%, due to increased consumer and commercial loan net charge-offs.Total noninterest income was $624 million, an increase of $46 million, or 8%. Trust income increased $30 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher revenue from our RidgeWorth mutual fund complex and higher market valuations on managed equity assets. Retail investment income increased $28 million, or 20%, driven by increased recurring brokerage revenue and annuity income.As of September 30, 2011, assets under management were approximately $96.7 billion compared to $107.9 billion as of September 30, 2010. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, managed institutional assets, and participant-directed retirement accounts. The September 30, 2010 assets under management included approximately $4 billion of money market mutual fund assets that were transferred to a third party during the fourth quarter of 2010. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $187.8 billion, which includes $96.7 billion in assets under management, $47.3 billion in non-managed trust assets, $34.2 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $9.6 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.Total noninterest expense was $710 million, an increase of $38 million, or 6%, over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by staff expense due to higher compensation associated with revenue growth, as well as increases in structural expense, other real estate expense, allocated deposit operations expense, and allocated administrative expense.Corporate Other and TreasuryCorporate Other and Treasury's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $407 million, an increase of $62 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased net interest income, favorable mark-to-market valuations on our public debt and index-linked CDs carried at fair value, and lower losses from the extinguishment of debt.Net interest income was $385 million, an increase of $27 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was mainly due to the interest rate environment and balance sheet risk management strategies. Total average assets decreased $1.2 billion, or 4%, primarily due to a reduction in investment securities in conjunction with the redemption of U.S. Treasury preferred 114stock in the first quarter of 2011. Total average deposits remained consistent with the prior year. Average long-term debt decreased by $3.1 billion, or 20%, compared to last year as we repaid FHLB advances and senior and subordinated bank debt in conjunction with strong consumer and commercial deposit growth.Total noninterest income was $254 million, an increase of $61 million, or 32%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was mainly due to favorable mark-to-market valuations on our public debt and index-linked CDs carried at fair value and partially offset by a $31 million decrease in gains of the sale of investment securities.Total noninterest expense decreased $40 million compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease is mainly due to FHLB debt termination losses in 2010 and lower net recovery of allocated corporate administrative expense.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A, which is incorporated herein by reference.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresThe Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2011. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2011. However, the Company believes that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance, but can provide reasonable assurance, that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.Changes in internal control over financial reportingThere have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of its business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. Although the ultimate outcome of these suits cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of management that none of these matters, when resolved, will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. For additional information, see Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference.Item 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and in Part II, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.115In addition, the Company amends the following risk factors to reference additional information.We are subject to certain risks related to originating, selling and servicing mortgages. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers, investors or insurers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. We originate and often sell mortgage loans. When we sell mortgage loans, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event that we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. Likewise, we are required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if we breach a representation or warranty in connection with our securitizations, whether or not we were the originator of the loan. While in many cases we may have a remedy available against the originating broker or correspondent, often these may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against us, and we face the further risk that the originating broker or correspondent may not have the financial capacity to satisfy remedies that may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from the originating broker or correspondent. We have received a number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers. These have resulted in an increase in the amount of losses for repurchases. While we have taken steps to enhance our underwriting policies and procedures, these steps will not reduce risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, our results of operations may be adversely affected.During the third quarter of 2011, repurchase requests increased substantially. However, repurchase requests historically have been highly volatile and it is too early to tell if this is the beginning of a trend. If repurchase requests remain at current or higher levels, we may need to increase the repurchase reserve, which would adversely affect net income available to common shareholders. See Note 13, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Noninterest Income” sections in this Form 10-Q. In addition, investors have begun to demonstrate reduced flexibility and reduced willingness to resolve pending repurchase requests and, if this continues, our repurchase rates may increase and this would cause us to increase our repurchase reserve.Finally, we have received indemnification requests related to our servicing of loans owned or insured by other parties, primarily GSEs. Typically, such a claim seeks to impose a compensatory fee on us for departures from GSE service levels. In most cases, this is related to delays in the foreclosure process. Additionally, we have received indemnification requests where an investor or insurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of the servicing agreement. While the number of such claims has been small, these could increase in the future. See Note 13, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Other Nonperforming Assets.”The fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In particular, programs to facilitate loan refinancing, such as the recently expanded Home Affordable Refinance Program, may cause us to reevaluate repayment assumptions related to the prepayment speed assumptions related to loans that we service, and this may adversely affect the fair value of our MSR asset. Federal Reserve policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict. As a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The continuing weakness or further weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on our business: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in the value of our LHFS or other assets;•A loss of clients, reduced earnings, and/or a suppressed stock price could trigger an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;•An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy 116laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us; or•An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on LHFS. We depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer. The success of our business has been, and the continuing success will be, dependent to a large degree on the continued services of executive officers, especially our Executive Chairman, James M. Wells III, and our President and Chief Executive Officer, William H. Rogers, Jr., and other key personnel who have extensive experience in the industry. We generally do not carry key person life insurance on any of the executive officers or other key personnel. If we lose the services of any of these integral personnel and fail to manage a smooth transition to new personnel, the business could be impacted.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
