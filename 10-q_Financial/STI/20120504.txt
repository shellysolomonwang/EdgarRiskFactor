Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and in Part II, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this report, and include risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and 70increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even from inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.INTRODUCTIONThis MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated).We are one of the nation’s largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under three business segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See Note 14, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the change in our segment reporting structure since December 31, 2011. In addition to deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, capital market services, and credit-related insurance.The following analysis of our financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2012 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements, and other information contained in this document and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements and related information to conform them to the March 31, 2012 presentation. In the MD&A, net interest income, the net interest margin, and the efficiency ratio are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as, to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided below in Table 1, Selected Quarterly Financial Data.71EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWEconomic and regulatoryMany economic indicators showed signs of improvement during the first three months of 2012 after remaining relatively unchanged during 2011. Unemployment declined and consumer confidence and the equity markets improved. The unemployment rate, which fell below 9% during the fourth quarter of 2011, continued to decline modestly in 2012 but remained above 8%. Consumer confidence was stagnant throughout 2011, but grew 8% during the first quarter of 2012, as consumer spending increased amidst improving labor market conditions and subdued consumer price inflation. Despite improvements in these economic indicators, the economy was still facing economic pressures, both new and existing. The price of oil and gasoline rose substantially in the first three months of 2012, causing direct pressure on consumers' consumption of gasoline and other consumer goods. The U.S. housing market continued to be weak as evidenced by the large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties. Additionally, home prices remain under pressure and construction of new single-family homes remain at historically low levels. Additionally, while some actions have been taken in 2012 to ease the European sovereign debt crisis, potential for volatility in the financial markets continues to exist. As of March 31, 2012, we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of European countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. See additional discussion of European debt exposure in "Other Market Risk" in this MD&A.Despite the moderately improving economic conditions seen during the first three months of 2012, the Federal Reserve indicated in March that it expects to maintain key interest rates at exceptionally low levels, at least through late 2014. Additionally, the Federal Reserve continues to conduct accommodative monetary policy through the maintenance of large portfolios of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and agency MBS. However, the Federal Reserve indicated that the size and composition of this portfolio would be reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate to promote price stability and a stronger economic recovery. Amidst these actions, the Federal Reserve outlook remains for moderate economic growth, a high unemployment rate, and near term modest consumer price inflation. Regulatory and financial reform efforts continued in 2012, as regulatory agencies proposed and worked to finalize numerous rules. The Federal Reserve's final rules related to debit card interchange fees that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011 continued to cause a significant decrease in our interchange revenue. When comparing the first quarter of 2012 interchange revenue to the first quarter of 2011, we experienced a decrease of $41 million. We continue to believe going forward, the estimated impact of this rule may decrease our interchange revenue by approximately $40 - $50 million per quarter. However, we continue to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximately $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Regulation E and rules related to debit card interchange fees over the course of 2012 and into 2013, and inherent in this expectation is client acceptance of certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide. See additional discussion in the “Noninterest Income” section of this MD&A. In 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation's largest mortgage loan servicers, including us. Following this review, we and other servicers entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and "Nonperforming Assets" in this MD&A. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. Our work required to comply with the Federal Reserve’s Consent Order continues. At this time, we anticipate modest increases in certain expenses as we implement and comply with the provisions of the Consent Order. However, we note that the final regulatory guidance as to financial harm and certain aspects of the scope of the foreclosure review have not been finalized. Once finalized, such guidance could increase the current estimate of the expenses and would provide the basis for determining the amount of any remediation efforts. We also continue with settlement discussions with the U.S. and States Attorneys General related to mortgage servicing claims as discussed in Note 13, "Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.CapitalThe Federal Reserve completed its most recent CCAR for the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies in March 2012. The Federal Reserve's review indicated that our capital exceeded requirements throughout the Supervisory Stress Test time horizon without any additional capital actions. Therefore, we expect to maintain our current quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share, and we also expect to redeem certain trust preferred securities at such time as their governing documents permit, including when these securities are no longer expected to qualify as Tier 1 capital.We have received a communication from the Federal Reserve regarding the re-submission process, which includes the new economic scenarios, and we are in the process of preparing an updated CCAR that must be re-submitted to the Federal Reserve in June 2012, with the expectation that the Federal Reserve will complete their review by the end of the third quarter. Our 72first quarter results will be included as part of our updated capital analysis that will include another full stress test, and our management team will work closely with our Board to determine any appropriate future capital plan to include in our resubmission. Our capital remained strong at March 31, 2012, as capital levels increased as a result of strong first quarter earnings. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 9.33% compared to 9.22% at December 31, 2011. Our Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios increased to 11.00% and 13.73%, respectively, compared to 10.90% and 13.67%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Overall, our capital remains strong and well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards. See additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the and “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity Risk” sections of this MD&A.Financial performanceOur core performance this quarter drove a solid start to 2012 and marked a continuation of the improved momentum we built during 2011. Improved revenue, as well as continued favorable trends in loans, deposits, and credit metrics provided the base for the quarter's results. During the first three months of 2012, EPS increased, net interest income and noninterest income grew, credit quality continued to improve, low-cost deposits increased and remained at record highs, capital ratios remained strong, and we made progress on our goal of eliminating $300 million in annual expenses by the end of 2013. At March 31, 2012, we had eliminated $190 million in annualized expenses from our expense base through our PPG expense initiative. Net income available to common shareholders during the three months ended March 31, 2012 was $245 million, or $0.46 per average common diluted share, compared to $38 million, or $0.08 per average common diluted share during the same period in 2011. Results in 2012 compared to 2011 were driven by lower provision for credit losses, higher net interest income, and the absence of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury in 2011 and a non-cash charge related to the accelerated accretion associated with repayment of the U.S. government's TARP investment in March 2011. These results were partially offset by higher noninterest expense. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, improved credit quality resulted in a decrease of 29% in our provision for credit losses compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, which was a significant driver of the increase in our net income available to common shareholders. As credit quality continues to improve, the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods. Our PPG expense initiative made significant progress in the first quarter of 2012, increasing to $190 million of annualized savings realized at March 31, 2012 (or approximately $50 million in savings realized in the first quarter) compared to $75 million of annualized savings realized at December 31, 2011. The three main components of the PPG expense program, strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies, and operations staff and support, all contributed to the progress during the quarter. Our Strategic Supply Management initiatives have lowered costs with our suppliers, as well as reduced our own demand for such services. In addition to contract renegotiations, savings are being realized through reduced travel and lower usage of temporary labor, courier, and print services. Consumer bank savings continue to be realized in branch staff and location efficiencies due to technological advancements and investment in lower-cost channels, with a high rate of adoption of the new technology by our clients. Additionally, savings have come from renegotiating the rate we pay for rewards related to our rewards check card program and restructuring the rewards earnings rate. In operations staff and support, savings have been driven by lean process design efforts and streamlining key business processes. Additionally, we have expanded our use of digital technology by reducing paper statements significantly. Our goal remains at $300 million in annual expense savings through this program. Given the progress to date, we believe that we are still well positioned to achieve the $300 million in annual expense savings by December 2013. However, the more important goal that we are achieving overall is establishing an efficiency minded culture that will benefit the Company and our shareholders beyond the stated plans of the PPG program. Our asset quality metrics continued to improve in 2012, with improvements in net charge-offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets, and early stage delinquencies. The improvement in credit quality drove a 31% decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to 2011. Net charge-offs declined 26% compared to 2011, with improvements in each portfolio. At March 31, 2012, the ALLL ratio remains elevated by historical standards at 1.92% of total loans, but declined nine basis points compared to December 31, 2011, due to decreases in the ALLL coupled with an increase in loans. We currently expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable to down during the second quarter of 2012. Total NPLs continued the downward trend that began in 2010, with a decline of 9% from December 31, 2011 as a result of reduced inflows into nonaccrual combined with our problem loan resolution efforts. Declines were experienced in all categories, with the largest declines coming from the residential and commercial portfolios. We expect a continuation of the declining trend in NPLs in the second quarter of 2012. OREO declined 14% during the quarter and was the result of continued disposition of properties once we had clear title coupled with a slow down of inflows. Our restructured loan portfolio declined 4% compared to December 31, 2011, with decreases in both the nonaccruing and accruing loan populations. The accruing restructured portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 89% current on principal and interest payments at March 31, 2012. Early stage delinquencies, a leading 73indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, declined during the first three months of 2012, both in total and when excluding government-guaranteed loan delinquencies. This decline was a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce risk in the portfolio as evidenced by declines in higher-risk loans. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Nonperforming Assets,” and “Restructured Loans,” sections of this MD&A.Average loans increased by $3.1 billion, or 3%, during the quarter, led by increases in commercial & industrial and guaranteed mortgage and student loans being partially offset by decreases in nonguaranteed residential and commercial real estate loans. The total average loan balances have also increased solidly from the same period in 2011, with similar portfolio category increases and decreases as those seen during the first quarter of 2011. Our risk profile remains noticeably improved as declines in certain higher-risk loan portfolios have been offset by targeted growth in certain lower-risk portfolios, such as government-guaranteed loans. As a result, our guaranteed loans represent 11% of the portfolio as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and 8% at March 31, 2011. A major driver of the increase in government guaranteed loans has been the purchase of guaranteed loan portfolios and originations. While our decision to purchase government guaranteed loans has benefited us in the current economic cycle, as the economy grows and organic loan growth increases, we expect slower growth of our government guaranteed portfolios in the future. Additionally, despite continued soft overall loan demand, we remain committed to providing home financing in the communities we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers during this uncertain economic landscape. To that end, during the three months ended March 31, 2012, we extended approximately $21 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients.Deposits remained at record highs during 2012 and the shift in deposit mix seen during 2011 to lower-cost deposits continued. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% during three months ended March 31, 2012, led by average balance increases of 4% in noninterest-bearing DDAs, partially offset by declines in higher cost CDs of 4%. Average deposits grew 4% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, due primarily to the same factors as the growth in the current quarter. Due to the growth seen in core deposits, our liquidity has been enhanced, enabling us to reduce our higher-cost wholesale funding sources. Our primary higher-cost funding source is long-term debt, which we reduced, on average, by 11% and 18% compared to the prior quarter and prior year quarter, respectively. While we continue to believe that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients’ desires for having increased liquidity, we believe that we have also proactively generated this growth in both our Consumer and Wholesale business, as we have expanded the number of primary client relationships.Increased revenue and improved asset quality contributed to improved core performance and operating trends as seen in lower provision for credit losses and higher net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses compared to a year ago. Total revenue, on an FTE basis, increased 3% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, driven by an increase in net interest income as a result of higher loan balances and lower interest expense, offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of lower card income and less securities gains. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, increased 5% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, primarily as a result of lower funding costs and an improved funding mix. Our net interest margin was 3.49% for the three months ended March 31, 2012, modestly down from 3.53% during the same period in 2011. Noninterest income declined 1% compared to 2011, most notably due to decreases in card fees and lower securities gains, predominantly offset by increased mortgage-related income that was driven by the low interest rate environment, which caused increased production volume. Card fees were lower during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to the new regulations on debit card interchange fees that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011. Noninterest expense increased 5% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, driven primarily by higher personnel costs and operating losses, partially offset by lower FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments and lower advertising spending. The higher personnel costs were due to higher incentive compensation associated with improved business performance and annual salary increases. The increase in the operating losses was driven by litigation-related expenses, which tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters, as well as operating losses associated with mortgage servicing. See additional discussion of our financial performance in the “Consolidated Financial Results” section of this MD&A.74Line of Business HighlightsDuring the first quarter of 2012, we changed our reporting segments. At March 31, 2012, we measured business activities based on three segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. During the first three months of 2012, core performance improved in each line of business, with higher revenues and net income in each segment compared to the prior year. Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management•The Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment had higher net income, driven by increased net interest income and lower credit losses compared to the same period in 2011. Net income was 33% higher as net interest income grew and the provision for credit losses declined 23% during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. •We have capitalized on our deposit transformation away from free checking and retained 98% of our balances through this process. The average deposit size of a new checking account is up almost 50% in our Everyday Checking product relative to what it was under Free Checking. Additionally, favorable deposit trends toward lower-cost products continued.•Consumer lending production has been very strong, increasing 24% on an organic basis compared to the first quarter of 2011.Wholesale Banking•The Wholesale Banking segment also had higher net income, driven by increased net interest income, lower credit losses, and lower noninterest expenses. Net income was 60% higher as net interest income grew 10% and the provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses declined 31% and 3%, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. •The CIB line of business achieved its second highest quarterly profit in its history.•Commercial loan growth, primarily within the Commercial and Industrial category, remained solid overall, although concentrated in larger and middle-market clients, and deposit growth remained strong. Mortgage Banking•The Mortgage Banking segment had an improvement in net loss of 20% during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The current quarter results were largely due to a 26% decline in provision for credit losses and a 94% increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 35% increase in noninterest expenses during 2012 compared to 2011. •While we continue to manage through the legacy mortgage issues, we experienced another quarter of healthy mortgage production, increasing 33% compared to the same quarter in 2011. Our Corporate Other segment remained virtually unchanged from December 31, 2011 and encompasses all remaining areas of the Company and remains key to our asset and liability performance. This segment continues to manage the balance sheet within the context of changing financial market conditions. While this segment's net income declined during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, the driver was due to less gains on sales of AFS securities partially offset by a small increase in net interest income. Additional discussion of our segment structure and changes made during 2012 can be found in Note 14, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and further discussion of segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2012 can be found in the "Business Segment Results" section of this MD&A.75SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA  Table 1 Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions, except per share data)2012 2011Summary of Operations   Interest income$1,534 $1,554Interest expense223 305Net interest income1,311 1,249Provision for credit losses317 447Net interest income after provision for credit losses994 802Noninterest income876 883Noninterest expense1,541 1,465Net income before provision for income taxes329 220Provision for income taxes69 33Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest10 7Net income$250 $180Net income available to common shareholders$245 $38    Net interest income - FTE$1,342 $1,277Total revenue - FTE2,218 2,160Total revenue - FTE excluding securities gains, net 12,200 2,096Net income per average common share:   Diluted0.46 0.08Diluted excluding effect of accelerated accretion associated with the repurchase of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury0.46 0.22Basic0.46 0.08Dividends paid per average common share0.05 0.01Book value per common share37.11 35.49Tangible book value per common share 225.49 23.79Market price:   High24.93 33.14Low18.07 27.38Close24.17 28.84Selected Average Balances   Total assets$176,855 $173,066Earning assets154,623 146,786Loans122,542 115,162Consumer and commercial deposits125,843 120,710Brokered time and foreign deposits2,274 2,606Total shareholders’ equity20,256 23,107Average common shares - diluted (thousands)536,407 503,503Average common shares - basic (thousands)533,100 499,669Financial Ratios (Annualized)   ROA0.57% 0.42%ROE4.94 0.84Net interest margin - FTE3.49 3.53Efficiency ratio 369.50 67.83Tangible efficiency ratio 469.02 67.32Total average shareholders’ equity to total average assets11.45 13.35Tangible equity to tangible assets 58.14 7.87Capital Adequacy   Tier 1 common equity9.33% 9.05%Tier 1 capital11.00 11.00Total capital13.73 13.92Tier 1 leverage8.77 8.72   76SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA, continued Three Months Ended March 31 2012 2011Reconcilement of Non U.S. GAAP Financial Measures   Net income available to common shareholders$245 $38Accelerated accretion for repurchase of preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury— 74Net income available to common shareholders excluding accelerated accretion for repurchase of preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury$245 $112Net income per average common share - diluted$0.46 $0.08Effect of accelerated accretion for repurchase of preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury— 0.14Net income per average common share - diluted, excluding effect of accelerated accretion for repurchase of preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury$0.46 $0.22    Net income$250 $180Preferred dividends(3) (2)U.S. Treasury preferred dividends and accretion of discount— (66)Accelerated accretion for repurchase of preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury— (74)Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to unvested shares(2) —Net income available to common shareholders$245 $38    Net interest income$1,311 $1,249FTE adjustment31 28Net interest income - FTE1,342 1,277Noninterest income876 883Total revenue - FTE2,218 2,160Net securities gains(18) (64)Total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains$2,200 $2,096Efficiency ratio 369.50 % 67.83 %Impact of excluding amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs(0.48) (0.51)Tangible efficiency ratio 469.02 % 67.32 %Total shareholders’ equity$20,241 $19,223Goodwill, net of deferred taxes of $164 and $139, respectively(6,180) (6,185)Other intangible assets, net of deferred taxes of $14 and $24, respectively, and MSRs(1,142) (1,635)MSRs1,070 1,538Tangible equity13,989 12,941Preferred stock(275) (172)Tangible common equity$13,714 $12,769Total assets$178,226 $170,794Goodwill(6,344) (6,324)Other intangible assets including MSRs(1,155) (1,659)MSRs1,070 1,538Tangible assets$171,797 $164,349Tangible equity to tangible assets 58.14% 7.87 %Tangible book value per common share 2$25.49 $23.79    Total loans$122,691 $114,932Government guaranteed loans(13,633) (8,993)Loans held at fair value(413) (457)Total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans$108,645 $105,482Allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans 62.16% 2.71%1We present total revenue-FTE excluding net securities gains. We believe noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.2We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.3Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.4We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.6 We present a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.77Consolidated Daily Average Balances, Income/Expense and Average Yields Earned and Rates PaidTable 2   Three Months Ended Increase/(Decrease) From Prior Year Quarter  March 31, 2012 March 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable-equivalent basis) AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Yields/RatesAssets                Loans:1                Commercial and industrial - FTE 2 $49,542 $599 4.86% $44,181 $583 5.35% $5,361 (0.49)%Commercial real estate 4,737 44 3.72 5,720 53 3.76 (983) (0.04)Commercial construction 921 9 3.89 1,466 14 3.80 (545) 0.09Residential mortgages - guaranteed 6,478 53 3.25 4,305 35 3.26 2,173 (0.01)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed 21,946 259 4.71 22,173 287 5.18 (227) (0.47)Home equity products 15,283 141 3.70 16,214 151 3.78 (931) (0.08)Residential construction 738 9 5.13 962 12 5.20 (224) (0.07)Guaranteed student loans 7,308 71 3.93 4,376 46 4.30 2,932 (0.37)Other direct 2,100 23 4.45 1,741 22 5.01 359 (0.56)Indirect 10,112 100 3.99 9,473 114 4.89 639 (0.90)Credit cards 545 14 10.59 522 15 11.54 23 (0.95)Nonaccrual3 2,832 7 1.05 4,029 8 0.77 (1,197) 0.28Total loans 122,542 1,329 4.36 115,162 1,340 4.72 7,380 (0.36)Securities available for sale:                Taxable 24,250 190 3.14 23,705 185 3.12 545 0.02Tax-exempt - FTE2 420 6 5.41 549 7 5.54 (129) (0.13)Total securities available for sale - FTE 24,670 196 3.17 24,254 192 3.17 416 —Securities purchased under agreements to resell 731 — 0.03 1,064 — 0.01 (333) 0.02LHFS 2,649 25 3.70 2,726 28 4.13 (77) (0.43)Interest-bearing deposits 21 — 0.21 22 — 0.13 (1) 0.08Interest earning trading assets 4,010 15 1.49 3,558 22 2.49 452 (1.00)Total earning assets 154,623 1,565 4.07 146,786 1,582 4.37 7,837 (0.30)ALLL (2,428)     (2,852)     424  Cash and due from banks 4,563     6,485     (1,922)  Other assets 14,893     17,699     (2,806)  Noninterest earning trading assets 2,260     2,654     (394)  Unrealized gains on securities available for sale 2,944     2,294     650  Total assets $176,855     $173,066     $3,789  Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity                Interest-bearing deposits:                NOW accounts $25,262 $6 0.10% $25,370 $11 0.17% ($108) (0.07)%Money market accounts 42,489 25 0.24 42,603 48 0.46 (114) (0.22)Savings 4,860 1 0.12 4,266 1 0.13 594 (0.01)Consumer time 11,472 44 1.54 12,774 51 1.61 (1,302) (0.07)Other time 6,368 28 1.69 7,417 33 1.78 (1,049) (0.09)Total interest-bearing consumer and commercial deposits 90,451 104 0.46 92,430 144 0.63 (1,979) (0.17)Brokered time deposits 2,265 23 4.03 2,347 25 4.36 (82) (0.33)Foreign deposits 9 — 0.13 259 — 0.15 (250) (0.02)Total interest-bearing deposits 92,725 127 0.55 95,036 169 0.72 (2,311) (0.17)Funds purchased 871 — 0.10 1,114 — 0.18 (243) (0.08)Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 1,634 1 0.14 2,302 1 0.16 (668) (0.02)Interest-bearing trading liabilities 531 2 1.73 930 8 3.34 (399) (1.61)Other short-term borrowings 9,170 5 0.20 2,760 3 0.41 6,410 (0.21)Long-term debt 11,356 88 3.13 13,806 124 3.64 (2,450) (0.51)Total interest-bearing liabilities 116,287 223 0.77 115,948 305 1.07 339 (0.30)Noninterest-bearing deposits 35,392     28,280     7,112 Other liabilities 3,893     3,955     (62) Noninterest-bearing trading liabilities 1,027     1,776     (749) Shareholders’ equity 20,256     23,107     (2,851) Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $176,855     $173,066     $3,789 Interest Rate Spread     3.30%     3.30%   — %Net Interest Income - FTE4   $1,342    $1,277      Net Interest Margin5     3.49%     3.53%   (0.04)%1Interest income includes loan fees of $24 million and $39 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 2Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $31 million and $28 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.3Income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis.4Derivative instruments that manage our interest-sensitivity position increased net interest income $156 million and $154 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.78Net Interest Income/MarginNet interest income, on an FTE basis, was $1.3 billion during the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $65 million, up 5%, from the first quarter of 2011. This increase was predominantly driven by higher loan balances and lower interest expense, the latter of which was a result of the continued favorable trends in the deposit mix, lower long-term debt, and lower overall borrowing costs. Net interest margin decreased by 4 basis points to 3.49% in 2012, from 3.53% in the first quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase in average earning assets at lower yields, partially offset by a decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Yields on earning assets declined by 30 basis points to 4.07%, compared to 4.37%  during the first quarter of 2011, as growth in earning assets was primarily concentrated in lower yielding loans due to the current interest rate environment. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 30 basis points over the same period, predominantly due to the growth in lower-cost deposits, along with a decrease in higher-cost time deposits and long-term debt. Average earning assets increased by $7.8 billion, or 5%, compared with the first quarter of 2011. The increase was predominantly due to the growth in average loans, which increased by $7.4 billion, or 6%. The increase in loans was attributable to increases in commercial and industrial loans, primarily driven by our large corporate and middle market borrowers, government-guaranteed student loans, which increased primarily as a result of portfolio acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2011, guaranteed residential mortgages, and consumer-indirect loans, driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios during 2011. These increases were partially offset by declines in nonaccrual loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity products, and commercial construction loans. The declines in commercial real estate and commercial construction were both predominantly as a result of our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these higher-risk loans.Our loan portfolio yielded 4.36% for the quarter, down 36 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. The yield decline was predominantly related to increases in the consumer-indirect loan portfolio that included high-quality loans acquired at lower rates, increases in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio that also were at lower rates, a run-off of higher rate nonguaranteed residential mortgages that we replaced with lower rate guaranteed residential mortgages, and an increase in lower yielding government-guaranteed student loans. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The largest notional position of these swaps are receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. As of March 31, 2012, the outstanding notional balance of swaps was $13.4 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared with $14.4 billion as of March 31, 2011. Swap income remained relatively stable at $151 million during the first quarter of 2012 compared with $154 million during the first quarter of 2011. Reflected in our swap income during the first quarter of 2012, was approximately $69 million of income related to terminated swaps. Beginning in the second quarter of 2012, the quarterly income from certain swaps that were previously terminated will decline by approximately $35 million, which equates to approximately 10 basis points of net interest margin compression. Assuming no significant changes to LIBOR, we expect commercial loan swap income to remain relatively stable at second quarter levels for the remainder of the year. In the absence of additions or terminations, our notional balance of swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of 2013 with remaining maturities through early 2017. The average maturity of our active swap notional balances at March 31, 2012 was 3.2 years. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $0.3 billion, or less than 1%, from the first quarter of 2011. Increases in lower-cost client deposits and other short-term borrowings were mostly offset by a $2.5 billion, or 18%, decline in long-term debt and a $2.4 billion, or 12%, decline in higher-cost time deposits, compared with the same period during 2011. Total average consumer and commercial deposits increased by $5.1 billion, or 4%, compared with the same period during 2011. This increase was predominantly driven by a $7.1 billion, or 25%, increase in demand deposits. The growth in lower-cost deposits and the decline in time deposits and wholesale funding resulted in a 30 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared with the same period during 2011. The growth in lower-cost deposits was the result of successful sales efforts and clients’ increased preference for more liquid products. The increase in other short-term borrowings is a result of our FHLB borrowings, which is part of our ordinary balance sheet management practices.During the first quarter of 2012, the interest rate environment was characterized by a flattening of the yield curve versus the same period during 2011, as three-month LIBOR increased slightly and rates at the long end of the curve declined. More specifically, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25%, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. The Prime rate averaged 3.25%, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, benchmark rates were as follows compared with the first quarter of 2011; one-month LIBOR averaged 0.26%, unchanged from the first quarter of 2011, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.51%, an increase of 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2011, five-year swaps averaged 1.17%, a decrease of 115 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 2.12%, a decrease of 142 basis points.79Foregone InterestForegone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by 10 basis points during the first quarter of 2012, compared with 17 basis points during the first quarter of 2011, as average nonaccrual loans decreased by $1.2 billion, or 30%, from the first quarter of 2011.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Noninterest income decreased by $7 million, or 1%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, due primarily to lower net securities gains and card fees, predominantly offset by higher mortgage-related income.Net securities gains decreased by $46 million, or 72%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The higher gains on securities in 2011 were due to portfolio repositioning to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile and included sales of $9.4 billion of securities compared to $0.7 billion during 2012. See “Securities Available for Sale” in this MD&A for further discussion regarding our investment portfolio activity.Card fees decreased by $39 million, or 39%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decline was a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of fourth quarter 2011. When comparing the first quarter of 2012 interchange revenue to the first quarter of 2011, we experienced a decrease of $41 million. The estimated impact is consistent with our initial and future expectations, prior to any mitigating actions. As a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue, we have introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients’ needs and which we expect will provide additional sources of fee income. Additionally, we also expect to benefit from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs, actions taken to reduce the costs related to our debit card program, and the introduction of other value-added deposit product features over the next two years, which we expect will produce additional deposit fee income. Collectively, and over time, we believe that the benefits from all of these changes will enable us to recapture 50% of the approximate $300 million of combined annual revenue loss attributable to both the interchange fee rules and Regulation E. Inherent in this expectation is client acceptance of certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide.Other charges and fees decreased by $11 million, or 9%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Premium income related to reinsurance services declined due to paydowns in underlying loans' principal balances and the termination of contracts during 2011. Fee income was also impacted by a decline in letter of credit fees due to a reduction of $1.1 billion in outstanding letters of credit. Mortgage production related income/(loss) improved by $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher loan production and increased gain on sale margins, partially offset by an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Mortgage loan production increased 33% over the first quarter of 2011 as refinancing activity increased due to the HARP 2.0 program and the low mortgage interest rate environment. The mortgage repurchase provision for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was $175 million compared to $80 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net charge-offs during the quarter were $112 million compared to $75 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The reserve for mortgage repurchases was $383 million at March 31, 802012, an increase of $63 million from December 31, 2011. While repurchase demands declined from the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result of lower demand volume from GSEs, the repurchase reserve was increased during the quarter in light of our expectation for continued high levels of future demands, as well as our belief that the decline in net charge-offs could be timing related. Mortgage repurchase requests continue to vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of requests from GSEs. However, the majority of our demands continue to be from loans in the 2006-2008 vintages and that have been 120 days past due at some point in their life cycle. Additionally, the majority of the demands that we have received have been from loans that were delinquent within the first 36 months after origination. If this pattern continues and investor selection criteria does not change, it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we will receive demands could be stabilizing, given that any performing loans from the 2006-2008 vintages have now been outstanding beyond 36 months. We continue to believe that if this pattern continues, we will experience a reduced income statement impact in the latter part of 2012. However, we do not expect demands to decline meaningfully in the coming quarters, and the variability in the volume could persist. As a result of the continued uncertainty and our expectation of continued elevated demands in the near term, our mortgage repurchase provision and reserve may remain at historically high levels. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 11, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. Mortgage servicing related income increased by $9 million, or 13%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Improved net hedge performance was the primary driver of the current quarter increase compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The balance of mortgages serviced was $155.4 billion at March 31, 2012 compared to $164.5 billion at March 31, 2011.Other noninterest income increased by $10 million, or 21%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to higher leasing gains.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.Noninterest expense increased by $76 million, or 5%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase in expense was driven predominantly by higher personnel expenses, operating losses, consulting and legal, outside processing and software, other staff, and credit and collection services expenses. The increases were offset by lower regulatory assessments, other real estate expense, and marketing and customer development expenses.Personnel expenses increased by $43 million, or 6%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The $34 million, or 6%, increase in employee compensation expense related to higher compensation from improved business performance and annual salary increases, partially offset by a 2% reduction in full-time equivalent employees. The increase in employee benefits 81was due to higher medical-related benefit costs and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year quarter.Operating losses increased by $33 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was due to litigation-related expenses, which tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters, as well as operating losses associated with mortgage servicing.Consulting and legal expenses increased by $22 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was attributable to consulting costs associated with specific business initiatives, as well as costs to address the mortgage servicing Consent Order. For additional information regarding the Consent Order, see Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.Outside processing and software expenses increased by $18 million, or 11%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase is primarily due to various vendor credits received in the first quarter of 2011 and higher contract underwriting costs.Other staff expense increased by $7 million, or 47%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011, predominantly due to an increase in severance-related expenses. The severance expenses were associated with our PPG expense initiative and were $10 million during the first quarter of 2012. These severance-related expenses reflected continued progress on the PPG expense initiative. At March 31, 2012, $190 million in annualized expenses (or approximately $50 million in savings realized in the first quarter) have been removed from our expense base as a result of implementing the PPG expense initiative. See additional discussion related to the PPG expense initiative in the "Executive Overview" section of this MD&A.Credit and collection services increased by $5 million, or 10%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The increase was due to loan closing expenses, which was driven by the 33% increase in our mortgage loan production in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011.Regulatory assessments expense decreased by $19 million, or 27%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decrease was due to the change in the assessment base calculation for FDIC insurance premiums that took effect at the beginning of the second quarter of 2011 and a reduction in our assessment rate.Other real estate expense decreased by $19 million, or 28%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decrease was predominantly due to a decline in OREO inventory resulting in lower loss provisioning, combined with a decrease in losses on sales of owned properties. Over time, as the economic environment improves, we expect that other real estate expense will continue to improve, but will likely remain elevated compared with the levels realized prior to the economic recession.Marketing and customer development expense decreased by $11 million, or 29%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decline was attributable to lower advertising spending which fluctuates based on the timing of advertising campaigns.PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the provision for income taxes was $69 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22%. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, we had a provision for income tax of $33 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16%. The effective tax rate for both the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2012 was primarily a result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. See additional discussion related to the provision for income taxes in Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.LOANSWe report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, or classes, which further identify loans based upon common risk characteristics.The commercial and industrial loan type includes loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards, and other wholesale lending activities. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial and construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as commercial and industrial loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner-occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.82Residential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans, both guaranteed and nonguaranteed. Residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or junior lien position. At March 31, 2012, 31% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 69% were in a junior lien position. For home equity products in a junior lien position, we service 32% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product. Only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing during the remainder of 2012 and 2013, with 94% of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in 2014 or later, and over 50% in 2017 or later. It should be noted that a majority of accounts historically have not converted to amortizing. Based on historical trends, within 12 months of the end of their draw period, more than 75% of accounts, and approximately 65% of accounts with a balance, closed or refinanced before or soon after converting.We perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure. These activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity junior lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent, including when the junior lien is still current. We do not actively monitor the first lien delinquency status on an on-going basis when we do not own or service the first lien position beyond the initial notification of the first lien becoming delinquent. However, we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores of borrowers with junior liens, as these scores are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency. At March 31, 2012, our home equity junior lien loss severity was approximately 90%. Several financial institutions began reclassifying performing home equity lines that are subordinate to nonperforming first mortgages into NPLs this quarter. Based on our existing accounting policies and practices, we did not believe it was necessary to make a similar reclassification. Our methodology for calculating the ALLL considers the financial condition of the borrower, either through the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or through the regular refreshing of FICO scores, which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies. As of March 31, 2012, we had $36 million of accruing home equity junior liens subordinate to nonperforming SunTrust owned or serviced first mortgages. We do not have direct information on the delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by other parties. However, we refresh FICO scores on a quarterly basis, which provides an indication of the delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by others. In total, we estimate that we had $110 million to $175 million of accruing home equity junior liens subordinate to nonperforming first mortgages serviced by either SunTrust or other parties. A reclassification of current accruing junior liens subordinate to nonperforming senior liens would not impact our allowance requirement. Additionally, a reclassification would have an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income and NPLs.The loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct, consisting primarily of private student loans, indirect, consisting of loans secured by automobiles or recreational vehicles, and credit cards.The composition of the Company's loan portfolio is shown in the following table:Loan Portfolio by Types of Loans    Table 5(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 % ChangeCommercial loans:     Commercial & industrial$50,189 $49,538 1 %Commercial real estate4,910 5,094 (4)Commercial construction1,086 1,240 (12)Total commercial loans56,185 55,872 1Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - guaranteed6,447 6,672 (3)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed123,653 23,243 2Home equity products15,472 15,765 (2)Residential construction924 980 (6)Total residential loans46,496 46,660 —Consumer loans:     Guaranteed student loans7,186 7,199 —Other direct2,152 2,059 5Indirect10,145 10,165 —Credit cards527 540 (2)Total consumer loans 20,010 19,963 —LHFI$122,691 $122,495 — %LHFS$2,749 $2,353 17 %1Includes $411 million and $431 million of loans carried at fair value at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.83Loans Held for InvestmentOur LHFI portfolio has remained stable, increasing $196 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The most notable increases were in the commercial and industrial and nonguaranteed residential mortgage loan classes. We continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy, as we have been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer areas, and in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction areas that we consider to be higher risk. Continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios has resulted in a combined $210 million decline in these portfolios during the three months ended March 31, 2012, and an $8.0 billion decrease since the end of 2008, which have driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. Government-guaranteed loans remained relatively flat during the quarter, maintaining an 11% portion of our loan portfolio. Our strategy to purchase government-guaranteed loans has performed well during a time of low economic growth; however, if loan growth continues in the coming quarters, we expect slower growth in this category to continue as witnessed in the current quarter.Commercial loans increased $313 million, or 1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Growth was driven by a $651 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, largely offset by decreases in commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans. Our larger corporate borrowers drove much of the increase in commercial and industrial loans. Meanwhile, commercial construction loans decreased 12%, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure.Given the stresses in the commercial real estate market, we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. We have performed a thorough liquidity and contingency analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default by providing a thorough view of borrowers' capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with our clients to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client’s financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the client’s and guarantor’s, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes.Residential loans remained relatively flat during the three months ended March 31, 2012. We experienced slight declines across all residential loan classes except nonguaranteed residential mortgages, which increased $410 million during the quarter, largely offsetting the declines in the remaining residential classes. The increase in nonguaranteed residential mortgages was a result of lower interest rates driving greater origination volume, net of payoffs.Consumer loans increased $47 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Growth was led by the other direct loan class, increasing by $93 million, or 5%, offset by slight declines in the remaining consumer loan classes.Loans Held for SaleLHFS increased $396 million, up 17% during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributed to the transfer of $268 million in student loans and $60 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans, net of charge-offs to reflect the loans' estimated market value, due to the decision to actively market these loans for sale. Asset QualityOur overall asset quality continued to improve during the three months ended March 31, 2012, with net charge-offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets, and early stage delinquencies all declining. Net charge-offs were down by $50 million, or 11%, during the quarter. NPLs declined 9%, the eleventh consecutive quarterly decline, and totaled $2.6 billion as of March 31, 2012. Early stage delinquencies decreased 13 basis points during the quarter showing an 11% improvement from year end. NPLs declined $254 million, or 9%, during the quarter, and occurred across the majority of our loan classes, most prominently in commercial construction and residential mortgages. At March 31, 2012, the percentage of NPLs to total loans was 2.16%, down 21 and 130 basis points from the fourth and first quarters of 2011, respectively. Net charge-offs were $422 million in the current quarter compared to $571 million for the first quarter of 2011. The $149 million, or 26%, decline was experienced across each loan category, with residential loans contributing more than half of the 84change in net charge-offs, compared to the first quarter of 2011. Reduction in our residential loan portfolio has been concentrated in the higher risk categories, which accounted for approximately 50% of residential net charge-offs this quarter. As we look to the second quarter of 2012, we expect to see net charge-offs relatively stable to modestly down.Early stage delinquencies for all loan segments matched their lowest levels in recent quarters at March 31, 2012, with commercial, residential, and consumer segments declining to 0.15%, 1.24%, and 0.45% of total loans, respectively. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans reached its lowest level in recent quarters, down 9 basis points this quarter to 0.59% overall. The improvement from prior quarters is attributable to normal seasonality of delinquency trends, coupled with continued improvements in the loan portfolio. Any further improvement in overall delinquencies will be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment and to a lesser extent, home values. In light of the continued improvement in credit quality during the three months ended March 31, 2012, the ALLL decreased to $2.3 billion and represented 1.92% of total loans, down 9 basis points from December 31, 2011. The $109 million decline in the ALLL during the quarter was reflective of the continued improvement in asset quality, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio.We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 3, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.The following table shows the percentage breakdown of our total LHFI portfolio by geographic region:Loan Types by Geography         Table 6 Commercial Residential Consumer March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Geography:           Central127% 28% 21% 21% 14% 14%Florida220 20 26 27 18 18MidAtlantic326 26 36 36 25 25 Other27 26 17 16 43 43Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%1 The Central region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.2 The Florida region includes Florida only.3 The MidAtlantic region includes the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.85ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESAt March 31, 2012, the allowance for credit losses was $2.4 billion, which consists of both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience for the three months ended March 31, is shown in the table below:Summary of Credit Losses Experience    Table 7(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 % Change 5Allowance for Credit Losses     Balance - beginning of period$2,505 $3,032 (17)%Provision/(benefit) for unfunded commitments4 (4) NMProvision for loan losses:     Commercial loans38 108 (65)Residential loans258 322 (20)Consumer loans17 21 (19)Total provision for loan losses313 451 (31)Charge-offs:     Commercial loans(126) (185) (32)Residential loans(302) (385) (22)Consumer loans(35) (45) (22)Total charge-offs(463) (615) (25)Recoveries:     Commercial loans25 29 (14)Residential loans5 5 —Consumer loans11 10 10Total recoveries41 44 (7)Net charge-offs(422) (571) (26)Balance - end of period$2,400 $2,908 (17)%Components:     ALLL$2,348 $2,854 (18)%Unfunded commitments reserve 152 54 (4)Allowance for credit losses$2,400 $2,908 (17)%Average loans$122,542 $115,162 6%Period-end loans outstanding122,691 114,932 7Ratios:     ALLL to period-end loans 2,31.92% 2.49% (23%)ALLL to NPLs 489 72 24ALLL to net charge-offs (annualized)1.38x 1.23x 12Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)1.38% 2.01% (31)%1 The unfunded commitments reserve is separately recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.2 $413 million and $457 million, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from period-end loans in the calculation.3 Excluding government-guaranteed loans of $13.6 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, from period-end loans in the calculation results in ratios of 2.16% and 2.71%, respectively.4 $20 million and $23 million, respectively, of NPLs carried at fair value were excluded from NPLs in the calculation.5 NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Charge-offsNet charge-offs declined $149 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012, down 26% compared with the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decline in net charge-offs occurred across each segment of our loan portfolio and was particularly notable in our commercial real estate and construction, residential construction, and home equity loan portfolios. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 1.38% during the three months ended March 31, 2012, a reduction of 63 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. The continued improvement in net charge-offs has been the result of improved asset quality. For the second quarter, we expect to see a relatively stable to modest decline in net charge-offs from first quarter levels.86Provision for Credit LossesThe total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the provision for loan losses was down $138 million, or 31%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. The decline in the provision for loan losses was attributable to lower net charge-offs and improved credit quality.For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the provision for unfunded commitments was $4 million, compared with a benefit of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011. The provision for the quarter was attributed to updated usage given default factors, which were used in calculating the reserve for unfunded commitments, as well as increased commitments to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers as a result of improving economic conditions.ALLL and Reserve for Unfunded CommitmentsThe allocation of our ALLL by loan segment is shown in the table below:Allowance for Loan Losses by Loan Segment Table 8 As of March 31, 2012 As of December 31, 2011(Dollars in millions)ALLL  Segment ALLLas a % oftotal ALLL Loan segmentas a % oftotal loans  ALLL  Segment ALLLas a % oftotal ALLL Loan segmentas a % oftotal loansCommercial loans$901 38% 46% $964 39% 46%Residential loans1,315 56 38 1,354 55 38Consumer loans132 6 16 139 6 16Total$2,348 100% 100% $2,457 100% 100% The ALLL decreased by $109 million, or 4%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012, with commercial, residential, and consumer loans-related ALLL declining $63 million, $39 million, and $7 million, respectively. The decrease in ALLL was reflective of the continued improvement in credit quality of each segment as evidenced by reductions in higher-risk balances, improved early stage delinquencies, and lower NPLs. Our risk profile continues to improve, as the amount of certain higher-risk loans continues to decline, while lower-risk government guaranteed loans remained steady, comprising 11% of the portfolio. The variables most impacting the ALLL continue to be unemployment, residential real estate property values, and the variability and relative strength of the housing market. As of March 31, 2012, the ALLL to period-end loans ratio was 1.92%, down 9 basis points from December 31, 2011, consistent with continued improvement in asset quality, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio. When excluding government guaranteed loans, the ALLL to period-end loans declined to 2.16% at March 31, 2012 compared to 2.71% at March 31, 2011. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs improved to 89% as of March 31, 2012 from 85% as of December 31, 2011. The improvement in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $254 million decrease in NPLs, partially offset by the decline in ALLL.The reserve for unfunded commitments was $52 million as of March 31, 2012, an increase of $4 million, up 8% compared to $48 million at December 31, 2011. 87NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe following table presents our nonperforming assets:     Table 9(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 % Change3Nonaccrual/NPLs:     Commercial loans      Commercial & industrial$337 $348 (3)%Commercial real estate280 288 (3)Commercial construction198 290 (32)Total commercial NPLs815 926 (12)Residential loans     Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed1,291 1,392 (7)Home equity products317 338 (6)Residential construction204 220 (7)Total residential NPLs1,812 1,950 (7)Consumer loans     Other direct6 7 (14)Indirect16 20 (20)Total consumer NPLs22 27 (19)Total nonaccrual/NPLs2,649 2,903 (9)OREO1411 479 (14)Other repossessed assets14 10 40Nonperforming LHFS60 — NMTotal nonperforming assets$3,134 $3,392 (8)%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$2,152 $2,028 6 %TDRs:     Accruing restructured loans $2,750 $2,820 (2)%Nonaccruing restructured loans2714 802 (11)Ratios:     NPLs to total loans2.16% 2.37% (9)%Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO and other repossessed assets2.54 2.76 (8)1 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $152 million and $132 million at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.2 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.3 NM - not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Nonperforming assets decreased $258 million, or 8%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The decrease was attributable to a $254 million reduction in NPLs as we continue to make progress in our problem loan resolution efforts. Overall, continued NPL declines have been driven by commercial loans, as the higher-risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced, while the commercial and industrial loans have generally performed well. Another driver of the change since year end was the 7% decline in the nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs that was primarily the result of transferring $86 million of these loans to held for sale during the three months ended March 31, 2012 as we made the decision to actively market these loans and intend to sell them in the second quarter of 2012. As we move towards the second quarter of 2012, we expect the quarterly trends to continue, with additional declines in NPLs.Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the U.S. housing market correction. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming assets portfolio.88Nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, and TDR loans are problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses that are disclosed in the nonperforming assets table above. Loans with potential credit problems that may not otherwise be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans, which are disclosed, along with additional credit quality information, in Note 3, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. As of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there are no other potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed.Nonperforming LoansNonperforming residential loans were the largest driver of the overall decline in NPLs during the quarter, decreasing $138 million, or 7%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Specifically, nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs accounted for $101 million of this decline, primarily attributed to the transfer of $86 million of residential mortgage NPLs to LHFS due to the decision to actively market these loans for sale. As a result of transferring the loans to LHFS, the Company recognized a $26 million charge-off to reflect the loans' estimated market value. Reductions in home equity and residential construction NPLs also contributed to the decline, decreasing $21 million and $16 million, respectively, mainly attributable to net charge-offs and lower inflows of NPLs. We expect some variability in inflows of nonperforming residential loans during the remainder of 2012 related to mortgage loan repurchases from investors. See additional discussion of mortgage loan repurchases in Note 11, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Noninterest Income" section of this MD&A.Nonperforming commercial loans decreased $111 million, down 12% during the three months ended March 31, 2012, predominantly driven by a $92 million reduction in commercial construction NPLs. We continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate NPLs as we move through the current commercial real estate cycle.Nonperforming consumer loans decreased $5 million, down 19% during the three months ended March 31, 2012, due to a $4 million decrease in indirect consumer NPLs. The decrease was driven by net charge-offs of existing nonperforming consumer loans during the quarter, largely offset by the migration of delinquent consumer loans to nonaccrual status.Interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero. We recognized $7 million and $8 million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $46 million and $70 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, would have been recognized.Other Nonperforming AssetsOREO decreased $68 million, or 14%, during the three months ended March 31, 2012. The decline consisted of net decreases of $38 million in residential homes, $24 million in residential construction related properties, and $6 million in commercial properties. During the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $121 million and $190 million, respectively, contributing to a net gain on sales of OREO of $3 million and net loss on sales of $13 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves, primarily attributed to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Gains and losses on sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 36% and 41%, respectively, of OREO; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value, less costs to sell. Further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.Nonperforming LHFS increased by $60 million compared to year end due to the aforementioned transfer of nonperforming residential mortgage LHFI, net of charge-offs to reflect the loans' estimated market value.The majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency. Accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by $124 million, up 6% during the three months ended March 31, 2012, essentially all of which was attributable to guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans. At March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, $64 million and $57 million, respectively, of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were not guaranteed.At the end of 2010, we completed an internal review of STM’s residential foreclosure processes. Since that review, we have continued to improve upon our processes as a result of our review. Additionally, following the Federal Reserve's horizontal review of the nation’s largest mortgage loan servicers, SunTrust and other servicers entered into Consent Orders with the 89FRB. We describe the Consent Order in Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and a copy of it was filed as Exhibit 10.25 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. Additionally, borrowers who had a residential foreclosure action pending during this two-year review period have been solicited through advertising and direct mailings to request a review by the independent consultant of their case if they believe they incurred a financial injury as a result of errors, misrepresentations or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process. The deadline for submitting requests for review is July 31, 2012, and direct mail, internet, and media efforts to reach borrowers will continue during the next few months. These requirements prescribed by the Consent Order may result in additional delays in the foreclosure process at a time when the time required for foreclosure upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, continues to be elevated. These delays in the foreclosure process have adversely affected us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and by exposing us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. These delays have also resulted, in some cases, in an inability to meet certain investor foreclosure timelines for loans we service for others, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in the assessment of compensatory fees. Noninterest expense in our Mortgage Banking line of business increased during the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2011 as a result of compensatory fees, the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment, revise affidavit filings, and make any other operational changes. Additionally, continued and evolving changes in the regulatory environment and industry standards have increased our default servicing costs. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales has increased, and this has resulted in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances, and has adversely impacted the collectability of such advances. Accordingly, additional delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our process enhancements, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes, could further increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations.Restructured LoansTo maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees, to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms. Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as accruing TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will likely continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies. Roll rate models used to forecast losses on the residential mortgage and consumer TDRs are calculated and analyzed separately using their own portfolio attributes and history, thereby reflecting an increased PD compared to loans that have not been restructured. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $372 million and $401 million, respectively. See Note 3, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.90The following tables display our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status. Guaranteed loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled $68 million and $65 million at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.Selected Residential TDR Data          Table 10 As of March 31, 2012 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$462 $46 $508 $16 $57 $73Term extension20 9 29 2 20 22Rate reduction and term extension1,693 253 1,946 34 410 444Other 218 2 20 2 8 10Total$2,193 $310 $2,503 $54 $495 $549             As of December 31, 2011 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$473 $40 $513 $16 $69 $85Term extension20 10 30 2 24 26Rate reduction and term extension1,682 290 1,972 35 439 474Other 220 3 23 2 15 17Total$2,195 $343 $2,538 $55 $547 $6021 TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.2 Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.At March 31, 2012, our total TDR portfolio was $3.5 billion and was composed of $3.1 billion, or 88%, of residential loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $374 million, or 11%, of commercial loans (predominantly income-producing properties), and $38 million, or 1%, of direct consumer loans.Total TDRs declined $158 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012. Nonaccruing TDRs were down $88 million, or 11%, primarily reflecting net charge-offs during the quarter, as well as repayments. Accruing TDRs decreased by $70 million, attributable to repayments and a general decrease in the loan balances modified during the quarter. See additional discussion in Note 3, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such interest income recorded was $29 million and $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $39 million and $37 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, would have been recognized.91SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUEThe following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. For a complete discussion of our fair value elections and the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments, refer to Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Trading Assets and Liabilities  Table 11   March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Trading Assets   U.S. Treasury securities$162 $144Federal agency securities430 478U.S. states and political subdivisions47 54MBS - agency461 412MBS - private1 1CDO/CLO securities45 45ABS40 37Corporate and other debt securities501 344CP190 229Equity securities92 91Derivatives 12,066 2,414Trading loans 22,281 2,030Total trading assets$6,316 $6,279    Trading Liabilities   U.S. Treasury securities$446 $569Corporate and other debt securities132 77Equity securities34 37Derivatives 1942 1,123Total trading liabilities$1,554 $1,8061Amounts are offset with cash collateral received from or deposited with derivative counterparties when the derivative contracts are subject to ISDA master netting arrangements. 2 Includes loans related to TRSTrading Assets and LiabilitiesTrading assets increased $37 million, or 1%, since December 31, 2011, driven by normal changes in trading portfolio product mix including agency MBS, corporate and other debt securities, and trading loans. This increase was predominantly offset by a decrease in derivatives. Gross derivative assets decreased $551 million, but were partially offset by a decrease of $203 million in cash collateral. See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 12, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on trading assets.Trading liabilities decreased $252 million, or 14%, since December 31, 2011, predominantly due to a decrease in U.S. Treasury securities and derivatives, partially offset by an increase in corporate and other debt securities as a result of normal business activity. Gross derivative liabilities decreased $126 million during the quarter offset by cash collateral which increased $55 million. See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note 12, "Fair Value Election and Measurement," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on trading liabilities.92Securities Available for Sale      Table 12 March 31, 2012(Dollars in millions)Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses FairValue U.S. Treasury securities$221 $10 $— $231Federal agency securities1,671 77 1 1,747U.S. states and political subdivisions406 19 6 419MBS - agency20,251 718 2 20,967MBS - private237 — 21 216CDO/CLO securities43 — — 43ABS394 13 6 401Corporate and other debt securities43 3 — 46Coke common stock— 2,220 — 2,220Other equity securities11,032 1 — 1,033Total securities AFS$24,298 $3,061 $36 $27,3231At March 31, 2012, other equity securities included the following securities at cost: $432 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $398 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and $202 million in mutual fund investments.

The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $27.3 billion as of March 31, 2012, a decrease of $0.8 billion, or 3%, compared with December 31, 2011. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the quarter reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile. Early in the first quarter of 2012, we repositioned the U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities into agency MBS in an effort to capture better relative value. Also in the first quarter, we used securities cash flow to pay down short-term wholesale borrowings. During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, we recorded $18 million in net realized gains from the sale of securities AFS as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio, compared with net realized gains of $64 million during the same period in 2011, including $2 million and $1 million in OTTI, respectively. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see Note 2, "Securities Available for Sale", and the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.At March 31, 2012, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $3.0 billion in net unrealized gains, comprised of a $2.2 billion gross unrealized gain from our 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $805 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. At December 31, 2011, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.9 billion in net unrealized gains, which were comprised of a $2.1 billion gross unrealized gain from our 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $848 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. The net unrealized gain, excluding Coke, 93decreased due to the slight increase in interest rates experienced during the first quarter of 2012. The Coke common stock is subject to variable forward agreements which are discussed in Note 10, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and in the "Investment in Common shares of the Coca-Cola Company" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 3.17%, unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2011. This stability was a result of higher yields associated with cash flow run-off being offset by incremental yield associated with the repositioning of certain securities during the year.The portfolio’s effective duration increased to 2.5 years as of March 31, 2012 from 2.3 years as of December 31, 2011. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 2.5 years suggests an expected price change of 2.5% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.The credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong at March 31, 2012 and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns.Over the longer term, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. Accordingly, we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and/or declining deposits.BORROWINGS                   Short-Term Borrowings        Table 13 As of March 31, 2012 Three Months Ended March 31, 2012   Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End(Dollars in millions)Balance Rate Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$908 0.10% $871 0.10% $908Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 11,781 0.15 1,634 0.14 1,781FHLB advances5,000 0.16 7,396 0.15 9,000Other short-term borrowings 21,878 0.56 1,774 0.39 1,878           As of March 31, 2011 Three Months Ended March 31, 2011     Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End(Dollars in millions)Balance Rate Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$1,150 0.18% $1,114 0.18% $1,169Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 12,113 0.14 2,302 0.16 2,411Other short-term borrowings 22,858 0.72 2,760 0.41 2,8581Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of borrowings.2Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral, U.S. Treasury demand notes, CP, and other short-term borrowed funds.Short-Term Borrowings As of March 31, 2012, our period-end short-term borrowings increased by $3.4 billion, or 56%, from March 31, 2011, due predominantly to a $5.0 billion increase in short-term FHLB advances, partially offset by a $793 million decrease in dealer collateral, which was reclassified to offset derivatives, and a $332 million decrease in securities sold under agreement to repurchase. Average short-term borrowings increased by $5.5 billion, or 89%, at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to increased average FHLB advances of $7.4 billion, partially offset by a decrease in average funds purchased of $243 million, a decline in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $668 million, and a decrease in average dealer collateral of $753 million.At March 31, 2012, our FHLB advances were materially different than the maximum monthly outstanding balance and the daily average balance during the three months ended March 31, 2012 as a result of higher holdings of FHLB borrowings during certain parts of the quarter due to ordinary balance sheet management practices. Our period-end outstanding balances 94for funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other short-term borrowings were not materially different from maximum monthly outstanding balances or from the daily averages for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Long-Term DebtDuring the three months ended March 31, 2012, our long-term debt increased by $986 million, which was primarily due to a long-term FHLB advance of $1.0 billion. Subsequent to March 31, 2012, we refinanced $3.0 billion of FHLB advances as part of an interest rate risk management strategy. There have been no other material changes in our long-term debt as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.CAPITAL RESOURCESOur primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures (RWA) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Additionally, for purposes of computing regulatory capital, mark to market adjustments related to our estimated credit spreads for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital.Both the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of RWA. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average total assets, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.In September 2010, the BCBS announced new regulatory capital requirements (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements, through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements, new capital conservation buffers, and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure. Basel III would impose a new "Tier 1 common" equity requirement of 7%, comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The BCBS has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional, counter-cyclical capital buffer on top of Basel III standards. As this would only be included in periods of above-average lending activity, it is not included in our calculations. It is anticipated that U.S. regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS. We monitor our capital structure as to compliance with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and take into account these new regulations as they are published and become applicable to us in our capital planning.Capital Ratios  Table 14(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Tier 1 capital$14,755 $14,490Total capital18,419 18,177RWA134,128 132,940Tier 1 common equity:   Tier 1 capital$14,755 $14,490Less:   Qualifying trust preferred securities1,854 1,854Preferred stock275 275Allowable minority interest111 107Tier 1 common equity$12,515 $12,254Risk-based ratios:   Tier 1 common equity9.33% 9.22%Tier 1 capital11.00 10.90Total capital13.73 13.67Tier 1 leverage ratio8.77 8.75Total shareholders’ equity to assets11.36 11.3595Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and total capital ratios were 9.33%, 11.00%, and 13.73%, respectively, at March 31, 2012 compared with 9.22%, 10.90%, and 13.67%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The increase in our capital ratios was primarily a result of increased common equity driven by net income during the quarter. At March 31, 2012, our capital ratios remain strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements to be considered "well capitalized" according to the current U.S. regulatory standards. Additionally, our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under current Basel III regulatory requirements, increased to approximately 9.50% compared to 9.40% at December 31, 2011.The Federal Reserve completed its most recent CCAR for the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies in March 2012. The Federal Reserve's review indicated that our capital exceeded requirements throughout the Supervisory Stress Test time horizon without any additional capital actions. Therefore, we expect to maintain our current quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share, and we also expect to redeem certain trust preferred securities at such time as their governing documents permit, including when these securities are no longer expected to qualify as Tier 1 capital.We have received a communication from the Federal Reserve regarding the re-submission process, which includes the new economic scenarios, and we are in the process of preparing an updated CCAR that must be re-submitted to the Federal Reserve during June 2012, with the expectation that the Federal Reserve will complete their review by the end of the third quarter. Our first quarter results will be included as part of our updated capital analysis that will include another full stress test, and our management team will work closely with our Board to determine any appropriate future capital plan to include in our resubmission. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $27 million, or $0.05 per common share, compared with $5 million, or $0.01 per common share during the same period in 2011. Additionally, we declared and paid dividends during the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 of $3 million and $2 million, respectively, on our preferred stock. Further, during the three months ended March 31, 2011, we declared and paid dividends of $60 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock. We remain subject to certain considerations on our ability to increase our dividend. If we increase our quarterly dividend above $0.54 per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the CPP, then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the CPP will be proportionately adjusted. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 for additional considerations regarding the level of future dividends. Additionally, limits exist on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank. At March 31, 2012, retained earnings of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company totaled approximately $950 million; however, use of this amount for payment of dividends to the Parent Company is subject to regulatory approval by federal and state bank regulatory authorities.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThere have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTThere have been no significant changes to our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, except as discussed below.Credit Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our credit risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.Operational Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.96Market Risk ManagementMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately 56% of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, are approximately 45% of total loans.We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk.Market Risk from Non-Trading ActivitiesThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, both within policy limits approved by the Board and within narrower guidelines established by ALCO. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons.The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models.One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous 100 basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed. The net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates.Interest Rate Sensitivity from an Economic Perspective  Table 15 Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months(Basis points)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Rate Change   +1001.7% 1.5%-1001(1.6)% (1.8)%1 Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading assets. Therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading income from a financial reporting perspective.97Interest Rate Sensitivity from a Financial Reporting Perspective  Table 16 Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months(Basis points)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Rate Change   +1002.0% 1.8%-1001(1.7)% (2.0)%1 Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.The slight difference from December 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012 seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to the +100 basis point shock scenario is primarily due to a slight increase in asset sensitivity from projected balance sheet growth of floating rate assets and fixed rate deposits.We also perform valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios.As of March 31, 2012, the MVE profile indicates changes with respect to an instantaneous 100 basis point change in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. However, results at March 31, 2012 in the downward rate shock were significantly less meaningful than the upward rate shock. In a -100 shock scenario, current interest rate levels that are already at or near 0% are adversely impacting discounted cash flow analysis causing the short end of the discount curve to be zero bound and therefore, the shock behaves more like a curve flattener than a parallel shock.Market Value of Equity Sensitivity  Table 17 Estimated % Change in MVE(Basis points)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Rate Change   +100(2.6)% (2.4)%-1001(0.7)% (0.9)%1 Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.Market Risk from Trading ActivitiesUnder established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets, and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio. Our VAR calculation measures the potential losses using a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period. This means that, on average, losses are expected to exceed VAR two or three times per year. We had no backtest exceptions to our overall VAR 98during the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. The following table presents high, low, and average VAR for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. Value at Risk Profile  Table 18 For the Three Months Ended(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2012 March 31, 2011Average VAR$5 $6High VAR$5 $7Low VAR$4 $5Average VAR during the three months ended March 31, 2012 was lower compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011 primarily due to sales, paydowns, or maturities of illiquid trading assets, as well as risk-reducing activities within the derivatives business. While VAR can be a useful risk management tool, it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance. As such, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk. Specifically, scenario analysis, stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits are among other tools also used to actively manage trading risk.Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, averaged $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, were $4.8 billion and $3.6 billion at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in average and period-end trading balances was primarily a result of an increase in the TRS portfolio. Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments.The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a store of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 31, 2012, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $14.7 billion of free and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately 93% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.Some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes. Most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets. Therefore, whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity. If the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines, we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis.We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital related) for an extended period of months in accordance with Company risk limits.We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. The following table presents period-end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. We believe these contingent liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs.99Contingent Liquidity Sources   Table 19 March 31, 2012 March 31, 2011(Dollars in billions)As of  Average for theThree Months Ended ¹  As of  Average for theThree Months Ended ¹ Excess reserves$2.2 $1.8 $5.9 $4.0Free and liquid investment portfolio securities14.7 15.1 17.8 17.4FHLB borrowing capacity13.4 11.3 13.4 13.2Discount window borrowing capacity16.3 16.0 12.7 12.6Total$46.6 $44.2 $49.8 $47.21Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. As of March 31, 2012, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. In the absence of robust loan demand, we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to retire certain high-cost debt securities or other borrowings. The Parent Company retains a material cash position, in accordance with Company policies and risk limits discussed in greater detail below.Additionally, contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. As of March 31, 2012, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, and DBRS all maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the “Stable” credit rating outlooks.Debt Credit Ratings and Outlook      Table 20 As of March 31, 2012 Moody’s  S&P  Fitch  DBRS SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits, are primarily gathered from our retail branch network and are our largest, most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits increased to $127.7 billion as of March 31, 2012, from $125.6 billion as of December 31, 2011.We also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding increased to $18.4 billion as of March 31, 2012, from $17.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we borrowed some wholesale funds in the form of FHLB advances. However, our outstanding balance of FHLB advances declined by approximately $1.0 billion during the quarter as we redeemed other maturing advances at par using core deposit growth. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits, as well as Fed funds purchased, was $5.1 billion as of March 31, 2012, unchanged from December 31, 2011.As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5 billion of such securities, of which 100approximately $2.2 billion of issuance capacity remains available. The most recent issuance from this shelf occurred on October 27, 2011, when we issued $750 million of 3.50% senior Parent Company notes due January 20, 2017. The Bank also maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of March 31, 2012, the Bank had $34.1 billion of remaining Board authority to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, we had no Parent Company debt that matured, but approximately $1 billion of Parent Company debt is scheduled to mature later in 2012. A majority of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances.Recent Developments. Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective, the potential impact of which cannot be presently quantified. However, we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and liquidity management practices. See discussion of certain current legislative and regulatory proposals within the “Executive Overview” section of this MD&A.On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve published proposed measures to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms, pursuant to sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These proposed regulations include a number of requirements related to liquidity that would be instituted in phases. The first phase encompasses largely qualitative liquidity risk management practices, including internal liquidity stress testing. The second phase would include certain quantitative liquidity requirements related to the proposed Basel III liquidity standards. We believe that the Company is well positioned to demonstrate compliance with these new requirements and standards if and when they are adopted.Subsequent to March 31, 2012, we refinanced $3.0 billion of FHLB advances as a part of an interest rate risk management strategy.Other Liquidity Considerations. As presented in Table 21, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $63.9 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at March 31, 2012. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $4.9 billion in letters of credit as of March 31, 2012, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $2.9 billion of these letters supported variable rate demand obligations as of March 31, 2012.As of March 31, 2012, our liability for UTBs was $136 million. The liability for interest related to these UTBs was $22 million as of March 31, 2012. The UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions, and if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal operating cash flows, likely over multiple years.101Unfunded Lending Commitments  Table 21(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Unused lines of credit:   Commercial$36,761 $35,685 Mortgage commitments 18,976 7,833Home equity lines12,499 12,730Commercial real estate1,377 1,465CP conduit596 765Credit card3,681 3,526Total unused lines of credit$63,890 $62,004Letters of credit:   Financial standby$4,763 $5,081Performance standby56 70Commercial44 55Total letters of credit$4,863 $5,2061Includes IRLC contracts with notional balances of $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.Other Market RiskExcept as discussed below, there have been no other significant changes to other market risk as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. MSRs, which are carried at fair value, totaled $1.1 billion and $921 million as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes. We recorded increases of $67 million and $18 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows. For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $83 million and $88 million, respectively.For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, we recorded losses related to MSRs of $6 million and $25 million (including decay of $57 million and $52 million), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges.We continue to monitor our holdings of foreign debt, securities, and commitments to lend to foreign countries and corporations, both funded and unfunded. Specifically, the risk is higher for exposure to countries that are experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. At March 31, 2012, we identified five countries in Europe that we believe are experiencing strains such that the likelihood of default is higher than would be anticipated if current economic, fiscal, and political strains were not present. The countries we identified were Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and were chosen based on the economic situation experienced in these countries during 2011, the first three months of 2012, and continuing to exist as of March 31, 2012. At March 31, 2012, we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries. However, at March 31, 2012, we had direct exposure to corporations and individuals in these countries of $11 million, that comprised securities held, unfunded commitments to lend, and a nominal amount of funded loans. Indirect exposure to these countries was $62 million at March 31, 2012 and consisted primarily of double default risk exposure. The majority of the exposure is the notional amount of letters of credit issued on behalf of our role as an agent bank under the terms of a syndicated corporate loan agreement, wherein other participant banks in the syndicate are located in the identified higher risk countries. Overall, gross exposure to these countries continues to be less than 1% of our total assets as of March 31, 2012, consistent with our exposure at December 31, 2011.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSSee discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 6, “Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities,” and Note 11, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTSIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. Except as noted within the “Borrowings" section of this MD&A, there have been no material changes in our Contractual Commitments as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.102BUSINESS SEGMENTSThe following table presents net income/(loss) for our reportable business segments for the three months ended March 31:Net Income/(Loss) by Segment  Table 22(Dollars in millions)2012 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management$61 $46Wholesale Banking154 96Mortgage Banking(132) (166)Corporate Other106 127The following table presents average loans and average deposits for our reportable business segments for the three months ended March 31:Average Loans and Deposits by Segment      Table 23 Average Loans Average Consumer and Commercial Deposits(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 2012 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management$41,462 $38,856 $76,809 $75,975Wholesale Banking50,269 46,997 45,780 41,581Mortgage Banking30,796 29,315 3,199 2,983Corporate Other15 (6) 55 171See Note 14, “Business Segment Reporting,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for discussion of our segment structure, basis of presentation and internal management reporting methodologies.BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTSThree Months Ended March 31, 2012 vs. 2011Consumer Banking and Private Wealth ManagementConsumer Banking and Private Wealth Management reported net income of $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase of $15 million, or 33%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in net income was predominantly due to lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income was $634 million, an increase of $15 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was driven by higher average loan and deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. Net interest income related to loans increased $10 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year driven by higher average loans, partially offset by a 9 basis point decline in interest rate spread. Average loan balances increased $2.6 billion, or 7%, driven by higher indirect auto and student loan originations, and the acquisition of student loan portfolios, partially offset by decreases in home equity lines, residential mortgages, and attrition of acquired indirect auto loans purchased in late 2010. Net interest income related to deposits was essentially flat versus the same period in 2011 as deposit spreads decreased and was partially offset by increases in average deposit balances. Average deposit balances increased $834 million, or 1%. Favorable deposit mix trends continued as low cost average deposit balances increased, offsetting a $2.1 billion, or 12%, decline in average time deposits. Provision for credit losses was $155 million, a decrease of $47 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was driven by net charge-off declines of $26 million in home equity lines, $8 million in residential mortgage loans, $6 million in credit card, and $5 million in consumer indirect installment.Total noninterest income was $323 million, a decrease of $36 million, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2011. Check card interchange revenue decreased $45 million versus the same period in 2011 driven by regulations on debit interchange fee income that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011, partially offset by higher consumer credit card interchange fees.103Total noninterest expense was $707 million, higher by $4 million compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was driven by increases in shared corporate expenses, partially offset by lower staff expense and reduced rewards program expense.Wholesale BankingWholesale Banking reported net income of $154 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase of $58 million, or 60%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in net income was attributable to decreases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses combined with an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a modest decline in noninterest income.Net interest income was $458 million, a $43 million, or 10%, increase from the same period in 2011. Average loan balances increased $3.3 billion or 7%, with increases in commercial and tax-exempt loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans. Net interest income related to loans increased $15 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2011 due to increased loan volumes and one extra day in 2012, partly offset by a 3 basis point decrease in loan spreads. Average customer deposit balances increased $4.2 billion, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2011. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as higher cost time deposits declined $0.2 billion, or 10%, while lower cost demand deposits increased $5.8 billion, or 33%. Interest bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts combined average balances decreased $1.4 billion, or 7%, due partly to balances migrating to demand deposit products. Net interest income related to deposits increased $22 million, or 12%, due to increases in both deposit balances and spreads.Provision for credit losses was $101 million, a decrease of $45 million, or 31%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net charge-offs in commercial real estate loans.Total noninterest income was $379 million, a decrease of $9 million, or 2%, from the prior year predominantly driven by decreases in debit card service fees, letters of credit fees, and securitization fees, partially offset by increases in leasing revenue, higher syndication and bond fees, and increases in fixed income sales and trading revenue.Total noninterest expense was $515 million, a decrease of $18 million, or 3%, from the prior year driven by lower credit related expenses, compensation and benefit expenses, customer development expenses, and corporate product and indirect costs, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets and outside processing costs.Mortgage BankingMortgage Banking reported a net loss of $132 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared with a net loss of $166 million for the same period in 2011, an improvement of $34 million, or 20%. The improvement was driven by lower provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses.Net interest income was $126 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, up $6 million, or 5%, predominantly due to higher net interest income on loans and reduced funding costs on lower MSRs balances, partially offset by lower deposit income. Residential mortgage loans were up $1.7 billion, or 7%, resulting in an increase in net interest income of $4 million. Average MSRs declined $558 million which increased net interest income $6 million, or 55%. Total average deposits were up $216 million, resulting in a decrease in net interest income of $3 million due to lower deposit spreads.Provision for credit losses was $166 million, a decline of $57 million, or 26% compared to the same period in 2011. The improvement was driven by a $54 million decline in residential mortgage net charge-offs. Net-charge-offs included $26 million and $10 million of charge-offs related to the transfer to held for sale of nonperforming residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively. The sale of the first quarter 2012 transferred loans is expected to be completed in the second quarter.Total noninterest income was $157 million, an increase of $76 million, or 94%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was predominantly driven by higher mortgage production income. Mortgage loan production income increased $64 million due to higher gain on sale and fee income, partially offset by higher mortgage repurchase provision. Loan originations were $7.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared with $5.8 billion for the prior year, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 33%. Mortgage servicing income of $81 million, increased $9 million, or 12%. Total loans serviced were $155.4 billion at March 31, 2012 compared with $164.5 billion at March 31, 2011, down 6%.Total noninterest expense of $334 million, increased $86 million, or 35%, compared to the same period in 2011. Operating losses increased $38 million due to compliance-related costs, largely attributable to mortgage servicing and litigation expenses, and consulting expenses increased $19 million, predominantly due to costs associated with the Federal Reserve Consent Order and 104other business initiatives. Total allocated costs increased $19 million and staff expenses increased $8 million driven by costs associated with higher volumes.Corporate OtherCorporate Other net income for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was $106 million, a decrease of $21 million, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was predominantly due to lower securities gains.Net interest income was $127 million, an increase of $5 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was mainly due to lower cost of funds driven by a decrease in other assets. Total average assets increased $0.4 billion, or 1%. Total average deposits decreased $0.2 billion, or 15%. Average long-term debt decreased by $2.4 billion, or 19%, compared to 2011 due to the repayment of FHLB advances and senior and subordinated bank debt. Average other short-term borrowings increased $7.1 billion due to short-term FHLB borrowings.Total noninterest income was $21 million, a decrease of $47 million, or 69%, compared to the same period in 2011. The decrease was due to a $47 million decrease in net gains on the sale of securities AFS.Total noninterest expenses decreased $4 million compared to the same period in 2011. The decline was mainly due to capital and debt issuance expenses incurred in 2011.Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A, which is incorporated herein by reference.Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresThe Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2012. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2012. However, the Company believes that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance, but can provide reasonable assurance, that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.Changes in internal control over financial reportingThere have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.105PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of its business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. Although the ultimate outcome of these suits cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of management that none of these matters, when resolved, will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. For additional information, see Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference.Item 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.Item 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
