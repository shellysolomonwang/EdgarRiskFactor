Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and include risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may face certain risks as a servicer of loans, or also may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; changes which are being considered in the method for determining LIBOR may affect the value of debt securities and other financial obligations held or issued by 70SunTrust that are linked to LIBOR, or may affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even from inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.INTRODUCTIONThis MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated). We are one of the nation’s largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under three business segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See Note 14, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a description of our business segments. In addition to deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services.The following analysis of our financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2013 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements, and other information contained in this document and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements and related information to conform them to the March 31, 2013 presentation. In the MD&A, net interest income, net interest margin, total revenue, and efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided in Table 1, Selected Quarterly Financial Data.71EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWEconomic and regulatoryThe first quarter of 2013 included moderate economic growth, improved labor market conditions and household spending, and further strengthening of many housing markets in which we operate. Household spending increased moderately, particularly related to spending on automobiles, durable goods, and housing, as the cost of financing these purchases remained at low levels. Compared to year end, the housing market demonstrated an increase in prices, favorable shifts in supply and demand, and some encouraging signs from certain homebuilding activity. However, uncertainty remained about the strength of economic growth amidst more restrictive fiscal policy and a continued elevated unemployment rate that ended the quarter at 7.6%. Consequently, consumer confidence decreased moderately during the quarter to the lowest level in the past 15 months. Consumer confidence also continued to be impacted by a sluggish economic recovery in the U.S., while concerns also remained over the economic health of the European Union and reports of slowing growth in other emerging economies. While some actions were taken during 2012 to ease the European sovereign debt crisis, uncertainty about the sustained financial health of certain European countries continued to exist during the first quarter as new uncertainties arose. During the first quarter of 2013, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed that a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain in effect for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve conveyed that it anticipates maintaining key interest rates at exceptionally low levels, at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5% and its long-term inflation goals are not met. As a result of employing its monetary policy, the Federal Reserve continues to maintain large portfolios of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and agency MBS with plans to continue adding Treasuries and agency MBS to its portfolio during the year. The Federal Reserve outlook includes moderate economic growth, a gradual decline in unemployment, and the expectation of stable longer-term inflation. These monetary policy actions may result in a persistent low interest rate environment that may adversely affect the interest income we earn on loans and investments. CapitalDuring the first quarter, the Company announced capital plans in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR process and completion of the Federal Reserve's review of the Company's capital plan. The Company plans to repurchase up to $200 million of the Company's outstanding common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, the Board approved an increase to the quarterly common stock dividend, effective in the second quarter, to $0.10 per common share from the current $0.05 per common share, and maintaining dividend payments on the Company's preferred stock. Our capital remained strong at March 31, 2013, as earnings drove a $344 million increase in our Tier 1 common equity, and our Tier 1 common equity ratio improved to 10.13% compared to 10.04% at December 31, 2012. Our Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 11.20% and 13.45%, respectively, compared to 11.13% and 13.48%, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Overall, our capital remains well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards. See additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity Risk Management” sections of this MD&A.No further information has been published related to the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators' NPR issued during 2012 related to capital adequacy rules to implement the BCBS's Basel III framework for financial institutions in the U.S. As currently proposed, we believe that our RWA would increase primarily due to increased risk-weightings for residential mortgages, home equity loans, and commercial real estate, resulting in a decline in our capital ratios. Under the proposed rules, we estimate our current Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, would be approximately 8.2%, which would be in compliance with the proposed requirements. See the "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" section in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the proposed Basel III ratio. We continue to dedicate the appropriate resources to the implementation of this and other regulatory rules as they become finalized and effective. See additional discussion in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A.Financial performanceContinued credit quality improvement and a significant decrease in expenses drove improvement in our earnings during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year. Net income available to common shareholders during the first quarter of 2013 was $340 million, or $0.63 per average diluted common share, compared to $245 million, or $0.46 per average diluted common share for the first quarter of 2012. Total revenue declined moderately as a result of the continued challenging interest rate environment, but offsetting the decline was a 33% decline in provision for credit losses and 12% decline in noninterest expenses. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was attributable to improved credit quality while the decrease in noninterest expenses, to their lowest level in three years, was driven by the abatement of cyclically high credit-related costs and our ongoing efficiency efforts. As credit quality continues to improve, the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods. During the first quarter, our efficiency and tangible efficiency 72ratios were 64%, an improvement of approximately 500 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012. Lower revenues were driven by a 7% decrease in net interest income as lower rates earned on interest earning assets outpaced lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, causing a decline of 16 basis points in our net interest margin. We expect continued net interest margin compression during the second quarter of 2013 due to the continued low interest rate environment, as well as a decrease in commercial loan swap income due to scheduled swap maturities. Our asset quality metrics continued to improve during the first quarter of 2013, as NPLs and NPAs both declined and annualized net charge-offs compared to average loans fell to a five year low. Total NPLs continued the downward trend with a decline of 5% from December 31, 2012, driven by reduced inflows into nonaccrual and continuing resolution of problem loans. Declines in NPLs were experienced in all categories, with the largest declines coming from the residential portfolio. OREO declined 15% compared to year end, totaling less than 0.1% of total assets at March 31, 2013, which was the result of continued disposition of properties, coupled with a moderation of inflows. Our restructured loan portfolio remained relatively flat compared to December 31, 2012, and the accruing restructured portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 96% current on principal and interest payments at March 31, 2013. Early stage delinquencies, a leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, declined during the first quarter, both in total and when excluding government-guaranteed loan delinquencies. This improvement was a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce risk in the portfolio as evidenced by declines in certain higher-risk loans. At March 31, 2013, the ALLL ratio was 1.79% of total loans, a decline of one basis point compared to December 31, 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased 35% and net charge-offs decreased 46% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, both as a result of improved credit quality. Annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 0.76%, driven by decreases in residential mortgages, home equity, and commercial real estate charge-offs. In the second quarter, we expect net charge-offs will remain relatively stable compared to the first quarter. Further, future improvements in our overall asset quality will likely be driven by residential loans, as the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized levels. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Nonperforming Assets,” sections of this MD&A.Average loans decreased by less than 1% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, as a result of declines across most categories, predominantly offset by a 2% increase in C&I loans. The decrease during the quarter was primarily driven by the fourth quarter of 2012 sales of guaranteed student and mortgage loans, while the increase in C&I loans was due to increases late in the fourth quarter of 2012 and ongoing growth of the portfolio during the current quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, average loans decreased 1% primarily related to the aforementioned loan sales in 2012 and decreases in home equity and commercial real estate loans. Partially offsetting the decreases in these loans was an increase of 9% in C&I loans and increases in indirect consumer loans and nonguaranteed mortgage loans. The percentage of our loan portfolio that is government-guaranteed remains at 8%. We remain committed to providing financing and fulfilling the credit needs in the communities that we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers. To that end, during the first quarter of 2013, we extended approximately $23 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients, an increase of 8% from the first quarter of 2012.Average consumer and commercial deposits were relatively flat during the first quarter as a largely seasonal decline in noninterest- bearing DDAs was predominantly offset by an increase in interest bearing transaction, money market, and savings accounts. Further, time deposits continued their decline with a 4% decrease in average balances from the prior quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% due to the shift from higher cost to lower cost deposits, led by an increase of 8% in noninterest-bearing DDAs and 4% in interest bearing transaction accounts. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in higher cost time deposits of 18%. During the current quarter, our liquidity was further enhanced as average consumer and commercial deposits remained at near record levels while we further reduced our wholesale and short-term borrowings. Specifically, during the quarter we reduced our higher-cost wholesale funding sources, primarily long-term debt, on average, by 11%. Additionally, we reduced our average short-term borrowings by 26%. Average long-term debt and short term borrowings were also down 18% and 59%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2012. See additional discussions in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" and "Borrowings" sections of this MD&A.Total revenue, on an FTE basis, decreased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by lower net interest income as a result of the continued low interest rate environment. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily as a result of lower loan yields that were caused by the low interest rate environment and a decrease in our commercial loan swap-related income. Additionally, a 60 basis point decline in yields on AFS securities contributed to the decrease in net interest income, as a result of the lower interest rate environment and the foregone dividend income on shares of Coke common stock that we sold in the third quarter of 2012. Partially offsetting these declines in asset yields was a decrease in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the consumer shift to lower cost deposit products from higher cost products and a significant decline in our long-term debt expense. Our net interest margin was 3.33% for the first quarter of 2013, compared to 3.49% for the 73first quarter of 2012. The decline in margin was due to the same factors as noted in the decline in net interest income. Noninterest income decreased 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by reductions in mortgage servicing related income, securities gains, and trading income, largely offset by a lower mortgage repurchase provision. Mortgage servicing related income decreased 53% as a result of lower servicing fees as the servicing portfolio declined 8% and also due to less favorable net hedge performance. The mortgage repurchase provision decreased $161 million compared to the first quarter of 2012 as a result of our third quarter of 2012 increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve to a level that reflects estimated losses of remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre-2009 GSEs loan sales. Noninterest expense decreased 12% compared to the first quarter of 2012. The driver of the decrease was an approximate 55% reduction in credit-related expenses and operating losses. Also contributing to the decrease was employee compensation, severance expense, and legal and consulting expenses. Decreases in OREO expense drove the decline in credit-related expense, and the elimination of certain expenses associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review drove the decline in legal and consulting expense. Employee compensation decreased 5% largely attributable to the reduction in full-time equivalent employees, as well as due to lower incentive compensation. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, earnings before income taxes increased $86 million, driven by decreases in expenses and provision for credit losses that more than offset lower revenue. A primary driver for the decline in revenue was the $82 million  decrease in mortgage production income, predominantly all of which was the result of lower gain on sale margins. Partially offsetting the decrease in gain on sale margins was an increase of $6 million in origination fees, driven by an 11% increase in production volume. Also impacting the decline in revenue during the quarter was the $44 million decrease in investment banking income. The decrease was driven by record fourth quarter investment banking income as certain transactions that were originally planned for the current quarter were accelerated into the fourth quarter as a result of the fiscal cliff uncertainty at that time. Investment banking income is also typically seasonally low during the first quarter compared to the rest of the year, so given the strength of our CIB business, we expect an increase in investment banking income during the second quarter of 2013 from the level seen this quarter. The decline of $147 million, or 10%, in expenses during the quarter was significant and was driven by the ongoing abatement of cyclically high credit-related costs. However, marketing and certain other volume-related costs are expected to increase in the second quarter from the current quarter levels. As a result, we expect to see a modest increase in noninterest expense in the second quarter, while remaining well below the levels at which we were operating during 2012. The expense decrease during the quarter resulted in an approximate 150 basis point improvement in our efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios. See additional discussion of our financial performance in this MD&A. Line of Business HighlightsNet income increased and the efficiency ratio improved during the first quarter of 2013 in Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management compared to the first quarter of 2012. Reductions in expenses and provision for credit losses offset lower revenue to drive the 78% increase in net income over the prior year. The improvement in credit quality, most notably in our home equity portfolio, drove the decrease in the provision for credit losses. The reduction in expenses was driven by changes to our staffing model and retail branch network as a result of clients increasingly utilizing self-service channels. The decrease in expenses drove the 252 and 167 basis point improvements in our efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2012.  Wholesale Banking continued the momentum from 2012 with another quarter of strong results compared to the first quarter of 2012, with decreases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense helping to offset slightly lower revenue as modest growth in net interest income was offset by decreases in noninterest income driven by lower trading revenue. Continued credit improvement in our CRE portfolio drove the 63% decrease in the provision for credit losses. Noninterest expenses decreased 13% compared to the prior year, driving the 642 and 594 basis point improvements in the efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios, respectively, that remained below 60%. Mortgage Banking results improved significantly compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the decreases in provision for credit losses, mortgage repurchase provision, and noninterest expenses. These decreases were a result of improved credit quality and a continued improvement in the operating environment. The expense decreases helped to mitigate the lower gain on sale margins in the current quarter compared to the high levels realized in 2012. Despite the lower margins, revenue on new originations was strong as mortgage production volume was at its highest level since the third quarter of 2009 and increased 15% compared to the first quarter of 2012, led by an increase of 22% in refinance activity. Additional information related to performance of our segments during the quarter can be found in Note 14, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and further discussion of segment results for the first quarter of March 31, 2013 and 2012, can be found in the "Business Segment Results" section of this MD&A.74SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA Table 1  Three Months Ended March 31 (Dollars in millions, except per share data)2013 2012 Summary of Operations:    Interest income$1,359 $1,534 Interest expense138 223 Net interest income1,221 1,311 Provision for credit losses212 317 Net interest income after provision for credit losses1,009 994 Noninterest income863 876 Noninterest expense1,363 1,541 Income before provision for income taxes509 329 Provision for income taxes151 69 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest6 10 Net income$352 $250 Net income available to common shareholders$340 $245      Net interest income - FTE $1,251 $1,342 Total revenue - FTE 2,114 2,218 Total revenue - FTE, excluding net securities gains 12,112 2,200 Net income per average common share:    Diluted0.63 0.46 Basic0.64 0.46 Dividends paid per average common share0.05 0.05 Book value per common share37.89 37.11 Tangible book value per common share 226.33 25.49 Selected Average Balances    Total assets$171,808 $176,855 Earning assets152,471 154,623 Loans120,882 122,542 Consumer and commercial deposits127,655 125,843 Brokered time and foreign deposits2,170 2,274 Total shareholders’ equity21,117 20,256 Average common shares - diluted (thousands)539,862 536,407 Average common shares - basic (thousands)535,680 533,100 Financial Ratios (Annualized)    ROA0.83% 0.57% ROE6.77 4.94 Net interest margin - FTE3.33 3.49 Efficiency ratio 364.46 69.50 Tangible efficiency ratio 464.17 69.02 Total average shareholders’ equity to total average assets12.29 11.45 Tangible equity to tangible assets 59.00 8.14 Capital Adequacy    Tier 1 common equity10.13% 9.33% Tier 1 capital11.20 11.00 Total capital13.45 13.73 Tier 1 leverage9.26 8.77                                  75SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA, continued     (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31  2013 2012 Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures     Net interest income $1,221 $1,311 FTE adjustment 30 31 Net interest income - FTE 1,251 1,342 Noninterest income 863 876 Total revenue - FTE 2,114 2,218 Securities gains, net (2) (18) Total revenue - FTE excluding securities gains, net 1 $2,112 $2,200 Efficiency ratio 3 64.46 % 69.50 % Impact of excluding amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs (0.29) (0.48) Tangible efficiency ratio 4 64.17 % 69.02 % Total shareholders’ equity $21,194 $20,241 Goodwill, net of deferred taxes of $169 and $164, respectively (6,200) (6,180) Other intangible assets, net of deferred taxes of $5 and $13, respectively, and MSRs  (1,071) (1,142) MSRs 1,025 1,070 Tangible equity 14,948 13,989 Preferred stock (725) (275) Tangible common equity $14,223 $13,714 Total assets $172,435 $178,226 Goodwill (6,369) (6,344) Other intangible assets including MSRs (1,076) (1,155) MSRs 1,025 1,070 Tangible assets $166,015 $171,797 Tangible equity to tangible assets 5 9.00 % 8.14 % Tangible book value per common share 2 $26.33 $25.49       Total loans $120,804 $122,691 Government guaranteed loans (9,205) (13,633) Loans held at fair value (360) (413) Total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans $111,239 $108,645 Allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans 6 1.93 % 2.16%       76(Dollars in billions) March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Reconciliation of Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio     Tier 1 Common Equity - Basel I $13.9 $13.5 Adjustments from Basel I to Proposed Basel III 7 (0.3) (0.2) Tier 1 Common Equity - Proposed Basel III 8 13.6 13.3       RWA - Basel I 136.7 134.5 Adjustments from Basel I to Proposed Basel III 9 29.2 26.2 RWA - Proposed Basel III 165.9 160.7 Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio:     Basel I 10.1% 10.0% Proposed Basel III 8 8.2 8.2 1We present total revenue- FTE excluding net securities gains. Total Revenue is calculated as net interest income - FTE plus noninterest income. Net interest income is presented on an FTE basis, which adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. We also believe that noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.2We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.3Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.4We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.6We present a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.7Primarily relates to the impacts of unrealized securities AFS gains, certain disallowed DTAs, and accrued pension liabilities recognized in AOCI.8The proposed Basel III calculations of Tier 1 common equity, RWA, and the Tier 1 common equity ratio are based upon our interpretation of the notice of proposed rule making issued by the Federal Reserve in June 2012. The final Basel III ruling by the Federal Reserve is subject to potential changes from the proposed rulemaking, as is our interpretation of the rules.9The largest differences between the RWA as calculated under Basel I and the Basel III proposal relate to the risk-weightings for mortgage, home equity, and commercial real estate loans.                  77Consolidated Daily Average Balances, Income/Expense and Average Yields Earned and Rates PaidTable 2  Three Months Ended Increase/(Decrease) FromPrior Year Quarter March 31, 2013 March 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable-equivalent basis)AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Yields/RatesAssets               Loans:1               C&I - FTE 2$53,763 $556 4.20% $49,542 $599 4.86% $4,221 (0.66)Commercial real estate4,092 35 3.50 4,737 44 3.72 (645) (0.22)Commercial construction663 6 3.75 921 9 3.89 (258) (0.14)Residential mortgages - guaranteed4,079 27 2.62 6,478 53 3.25 (2,399) (0.63)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed22,386 238 4.25 21,946 259 4.71 440 (0.46)Home equity products14,363 129 3.64 15,283 141 3.70 (920) (0.06)Residential construction615 7 4.61 738 9 5.13 (123) (0.52)Guaranteed student loans5,397 52 3.92 7,308 71 3.93 (1,911) (0.01)Other direct2,398 26 4.43 2,100 23 4.45 298 (0.02)Indirect10,996 96 3.53 10,112 100 3.99 884 (0.46)Credit cards617 15 9.52 545 14 10.59 72 (1.07)Nonaccrual31,513 11 2.91 2,832 7 1.05 (1,319) 1.86Total loans120,882 1,198 4.02 122,542 1,329 4.36 (1,660) (0.34)Securities available for sale:               Taxable22,209 140 2.53 24,250 190 3.14 (2,041) (0.61)Tax-exempt - FTE2294 4 5.22 420 6 5.41 (126) (0.19)Total securities available for sale - FTE22,503 144 2.57 24,670 196 3.17 (2,167) (0.60)Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell1,092 — 0.04 731 — 0.03 361 0.01LHFS3,752 31 3.29 2,649 25 3.70 1,103 (0.41)Interest-bearing deposits21 — 0.13 21 — 0.21 — (0.08)Interest earning trading assets4,221 16 1.53 4,010 15 1.49 211 0.04Total earning assets4152,471 1,389 3.69 154,623 1,565 4.07 (2,152) (0.38)ALLL(2,178)     (2,428)     250  Cash and due from banks4,462     4,563     (101)  Other assets14,342     14,893     (551)  Noninterest earning trading assets1,917     2,260     (343)  Unrealized gains on securities available for sale794     2,944     (2,150)  Total assets$171,808     $176,855     ($5,047)  Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity               Interest-bearing deposits:               NOW accounts$26,383 $5 0.08% $25,262 $6 0.10% $1,121 (0.02)Money market accounts42,995 15 0.15 42,489 25 0.24 506 (0.09)Savings5,527 1 0.06 4,860 1 0.12 667 (0.06)Consumer time9,421 27 1.16 11,472 44 1.54 (2,051) (0.38)Other time5,245 18 1.37 6,368 28 1.69 (1,123) (0.32)Total interest-bearing consumer and commercial deposits89,571 66 0.30 90,451 104 0.46 (880) (0.16)Brokered time deposits2,087 13 2.61 2,265 23 4.03 (178) (1.42)Foreign deposits83 — 0.15 9 — 0.13 74 0.02Total interest-bearing deposits91,741 79 0.35 92,725 127 0.55 (984) (0.20)Funds purchased716 — 0.11 871 — 0.10 (155) 0.01Securities sold under agreements to repurchase1,705 1 0.19 1,634 1 0.14 71 0.05Interest-bearing trading liabilities723 4 2.21 531 2 1.73 192 0.48Other short-term borrowings3,721 3 0.29 9,170 5 0.20 (5,449) 0.09Long-term debt49,357 51 2.22 11,356 88 3.13 (1,999) (0.91)Total interest-bearing liabilities107,963 138 0.52 116,287 223 0.77 (8,324) (0.25)Noninterest-bearing deposits38,084     35,392     2,692  Other liabilities4,048     3,893     155  Noninterest-bearing trading liabilities596     1,027     (431)  Shareholders’ equity21,117     20,256     861  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$171,808     $176,855     ($5,047)  Interest Rate Spread    3.17%     3.30%   (0.13)Net interest income - FTE4  $1,251     $1,342      Net Interest Margin5    3.33%     3.49%   (0.16) 1Interest income includes loan fees of $27 million and $24 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 2Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $30 million and $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 3Income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. 4Derivative instruments that manage our interest-sensitivity position increased net interest income $119 million and $156 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.78            Net Interest Income/MarginNet interest income, on an FTE basis, was $1.3 billion during the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of $91 million, or 7%, from the first quarter of 2012 driven by an 11% decrease in interest income that was partially offset by a 38% decrease in interest expense. Net interest margin decreased 16 basis points to 3.33% during the first quarter of 2013, compared to 3.49% during the first quarter of 2012, as the decline in earning asset yields outpaced the decline in interest bearing liability costs. The decrease in interest income was a result of a decline in yields on loans and securities AFS due to the low interest rate environment, a decline in our commercial loan swap-related income, a decline in earning assets, and the forgone Coke dividend income as a result of the sale and contribution of our Coke common stock during the third quarter of 2012. The reduction in interest income on earning assets was partially offset by a decline in interest expense, which was due to the continued favorable shift in deposit mix to lower cost products from higher cost products, lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, and a significant reduction in long-term debt expense. Ongoing margin pressure is expected to continue in the second quarter due to the low interest rate environment and a further decline in commercial swap income of approximately 3 basis points, or $13 million, due to scheduled swap maturities. Policy actions by the Federal Reserve, as discussed in the "Executive Overview" section of this MD&A, may result in a persistent low interest rate environment that may adversely affect the interest income we earn on loans and investments.Average earning assets decreased by $2.2 billion, or 1%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by a reduction in our average securities AFS portfolio, which declined by $2.2 billion, or 9%, primarily as a result of the sale and contribution of our Coke common stock, and a $1.7 billion, or 1%, decrease in average loans largely due to sales of government guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans during 2012. Average nonaccrual loans also declined 47%, driven by sales of NPLs during 2012. These decreases were partially offset by significant increases in C&I loans, primarily driven by our large corporate and middle market borrowers, and consumer indirect loans. Also partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in average LHFS of $1.1 billion, or 42%, from the first quarter of 2012, as a result of higher mortgage production volume. Yields on earning assets declined 38 basis points to 3.69% during the first quarter of 2013, compared to 4.07% during the first quarter of 2012. Our loan portfolio yielded 4.02% during the first quarter of 2013, down 34 basis points from the first quarter of 2012, and the yield on our securities AFS portfolio was 2.57%, a decrease of 60 basis points. The yield declines were primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and, for loans, by the lower commercial loan swap-related income and, for securities, by the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The largest notional position of these swaps are receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. At March 31, 2013, the outstanding notional balance of active swaps was $17.4 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared to $13.4 billion at March 31, 2012. In addition to the income recognized from currently outstanding swaps, we also continue to recognize interest income over the original hedge period resulting from terminated or de-designated swaps that were previously designated as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans. Swap income declined to $114 million during the first quarter of 2013 from $151 million during the same period in 2012. The $37 million decline was primarily due to a decline in the income from $6.5 billion of previously terminated swaps that reached their original maturity date during 2012. As we manage our interest rate risk we may purchase and/or terminate additional interest rate swaps. In the absence of additions or terminations, our notional balance of active swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of 2013 with remaining maturities through early 2017. The average maturity of our active swap notional balances at March 31, 2013 was 2.1 years.79The commercial loan swaps have a fixed rate of interest that is received, while the rate paid is based on LIBOR. Estimated quarterly income of these swaps based on current expectations of future LIBOR rates is as follows:  EndingNotional Balancesof Active Swaps(in billions) Estimated IncomeRelated to Swaps(in millions)Second Quarter 2013 $15.3 $101Third Quarter 2013 15.3 93Fourth Quarter 2013 15.3 93As of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 10.6 334Average interest-bearing liabilities during the quarter decreased $8.3 billion, or 7%, from the first quarter of 2012 and rates on interest-bearing liabilities were 0.52%, a decrease of 25 basis points. The decrease was predominantly as a result of a $5.4 billion, or 59%, reduction in other short-term borrowings, a $3.2 billion, or 18%, decrease in higher-cost time deposits, and a $2.0 billion, or 18%, reduction in long-term debt. These were partially offset by an increase of $2.3 billion, or 3%, in lower cost interest-bearing deposits. The continued shift toward lower cost deposit products from higher cost deposit products also included an increase of $2.7 billion, or 8%, in demand deposits compared to the first quarter of 2012. The driver of the decline in average long-term debt was primarily attributable to the redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities during the third quarter of 2012, which had a weighted average rate of approximately 7%. The reduction in average other short-term borrowings was due to a reduction in short-term FHLB advances during 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease of 25 basis points on rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the first quarter of 2012 was primarily driven by a 91 basis point decline in rates paid on long-term debt as we were able to repay higher cost debt with our increased lower cost deposits and available cash position. A 16 basis point decline in rates paid on consumer and commercial deposits also contributed to the decrease in interest bearing liability rates paid and was also a result of the improved funding mix driven by the shift from higher cost deposit products.During the first quarter of 2013, the interest rate environment was characterized by a continued flat yield curve and overall lower rates versus the first quarter of 2012, as rates across the yield curve declined. More specifically, during the first quarter of 2013, benchmark rates were as follows compared to first quarter of 2012; one-month LIBOR averaged 0.20%, a decrease of 6 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.29%, a decrease of 22 basis points, five-year swaps averaged 0.96%, a decrease of 21 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 2.01%, a decrease of 11 basis points. During the first quarter of 2013, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25% and the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, both unchanged from the first quarter of 2012.Foregone InterestForegone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by three basis points during the first quarter of 2013, compared to a reduction of 10 basis points during the first quarter of 2012, as average nonaccrual loans decreased by $1.3 billion from the first quarter of 2012. See additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the “Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.2 PIN interchange fee income was previously presented in other charges and fees and is now included in card fees, where other interchange income is recorded, for both periods presented.Noninterest income decreased $13 million, or 1%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven primarily by reductions in mortgage servicing related income, securities gains, and trading income, largely offset by higher mortgage production related income.Trading income decreased $15 million, or 26%, during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was largely driven by an addition to our counterparty valuation reserve in the current quarter and normal fluctuations in trading activity. Mark-to-market valuation losses on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs were $24 million in the first quarter of 2013, which is approximately equal to the losses experienced during the first quarter of 2012.Mortgage production related income during the first quarter of 2013 was $159 million, an increase of $96 million, from the first quarter of 2012 due to the decline in the mortgage repurchase provision and higher production-related fee income, partially offset by reduced gain on sale margins. The higher production-related fee income was driven by increased loan originations that totaled $8.8 billion during the first quarter of 2013 compared to $7.7 billion for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 15%. Mortgage production during the first quarter of 2013 was comprised of approximately 80% in refinance activity driven in part by the HARP 2.0 program. The HARP 2.0 program contributed approximately 20% to the total refinance production activity for the current quarter. We believe that along with an improving purchase market, second quarter production volume will be comparable to the strong first quarter volume as a result of capacity additions in consumer direct lending, further HARP opportunities, and growth in our correspondent channel, which accounted for 33% of our production during the current quarter.The mortgage repurchase provision for the first quarter of 2013 was $14 million, a decrease of $161 million, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The lower provision was due to the third quarter of 2012 increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve. This was the result of information received during 2012 from the GSEs and our experience related to demands, both of which enhanced our ability to estimate losses of remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre-2009 GSEs loan sales and enabled us to take provisions in 2012. Future mortgage repurchase provisions are expected to remain consistent with the current quarter levels. The reserve for mortgage repurchases was $513 million at March 31, 2013, a decrease of $119 million from December 31, 2012, resulting from the recognition of expected losses. Resolution activity increased on outstanding repurchase requests during the current quarter, driven by the GSEs and us. Repurchase activity was consistent with our expectations as new demands increased in conjunction with an increased pace by the GSEs in the current quarter, while the pending repurchase request population and full file requests decreased from the fourth quarter of 2012. We continue to expect quarter over quarter volatility in future demands and full file requests as we work with the GSEs through the resolution process. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 11, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Mortgage servicing related income decreased by $43 million, or 53%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower servicing fees as a result of a smaller servicing portfolio and less favorable net hedge performance. At March 31, 2013, the servicing portfolio was $142.3 billion compared to $155.4 billion at March 31, 2012. The decline was driven by the sales of certain loans in the servicing portfolio and the high level of refinance activity.81Other charges and fees decreased during the first quarter of 2013 by $8 million, or 8%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was due to lower insurance premium income due to a reduction in reinsurance agreements with mortgage insurance companies and lower letter of credit fee income. Other noninterest income decreased $13 million, or 23%, during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to lower gains from the sales of leases.For the second quarter of 2013 we expect noninterest income to increase from the first quarter level, led by higher investment banking income that is typically seasonally low in the first quarter and a seasonal increase in service charges. Additionally, we expect mortgage production volume to remain strong, which will support origination fees.NONINTEREST EXPENSE          Table 4 Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 % ChangeEmployee compensation$611 $652 (6%)Employee benefits148 145 2 Personnel expenses759 797 (5)Outside processing and software178 176 1Net occupancy expense89 88 1Regulatory assessments54 52 4Equipment expense45 45 —Operating losses39 60 (35)Credit and collection services33 56 (41)Marketing and customer development30 27 11Postage and delivery18 20 (10)Consulting and legal fees15 36 (58)Other staff expense11 22 (50)Amortization of intangible assets6 11 (45)Other real estate expense— 50 (100)Other expense86 101 (15)Total noninterest expense1,363 1,541 (12)Noninterest expense decreased $178 million, or 12%, compared to the first quarter of 2012 and was at the lowest level in three years. The significant reduction was due to our ongoing efforts toward driving efficiency improvements, as well as further contraction in cyclically high costs. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower other real estate expenses, personnel expenses, credit and collection expenses, operating losses, consulting and legal fees, and other staff expense. Personnel expenses decreased $38 million, or 5%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was largely attributable to the reduction in full-time equivalent employees and lower incentive compensation. The lower incentive compensation was primarily attributable to an approximate $20 million reduction of expense as a result of the actual 2012 incentive payments made in the first quarter of 2013. While the benefit will not recur in future quarters, employee benefits are expected to decline due to their seasonal nature.Operating losses decreased $21 million, or 35%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by declines in litigation-related expenses that tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters and mortgage servicing-related compensatory fees. Credit and collection services expense decreased $23 million, or 41%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by lower escrow and servicing advance reserves as a result of the nonperforming and guaranteed loan sales that occurred last year. Other staff expense decreased $11 million, or 50%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by declines in severance expenses.Consulting and legal expenses decreased $21 million, or 58%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, predominantly due to the elimination of certain expenses associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review that was part of the Consent Order. We entered into an Amendment to the Consent Order in February 2013 that allowed us to begin eliminating consulting and legal costs of independent third parties providing file review, borrower outreach, and legal services associated with the Consent Order foreclosure file review. For additional information regarding the Consent Order and the Amendment, see Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.82Other real estate expense decreased $50 million compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was predominantly due to a decline in the OREO inventory resulting in lower loss provisioning, offset by gains on sales of owned properties in the current quarter compared to losses on sales of owned properties in the first quarter of 2012. It is unlikely that gains will continue to offset expenses, so future quarterly expenses may increase from the current quarter level, but as the economic environment improves over time, we expect that other real estate expense will continue to improve compared to the elevated level in the first quarter of 2012.For the second quarter of 2013, we expect noninterest expense to increase compared to the current quarter due to higher volume related expenses, marketing, and other real estate expenses. These increases are expected to be partially offset by lower benefits expense.PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. For the first quarter of 2013, the provision for income taxes was $151 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30%. For the first quarter of 2012, the provision for income taxes was $69 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22%. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to the first quarter of last year was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in the current period. The provision for income taxes differs from the provision using statutory rates primarily due to favorable permanent tax items such as income from lending to tax exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. See Note 8, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further information on the provision for income taxes.LOANSOur disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the related credit reserves 1) describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, 2) provide information on how we analyze and assess credit risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate ALLL, and 3) explain the changes in the ALLL and reasons for those changes. We disclose our loan portfolio by segment and/or by type of loan, which is the level at which we document our method for determining our ALLL. Loan types are further categorizations of our portfolio segments.We report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, which further disaggregate loans based upon common risk characteristics.The C&I loan type includes loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards, and other wholesale lending activities. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial and construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as C&I loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner-occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.Residential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans, both guaranteed and nonguaranteed. Residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or second lien position. At March 31, 2013, 33% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 67% were in a second lien position. For home equity products in a second lien position, we service 28% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product. Only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing during 2013, with 95% of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in 2014 or later and over 57% in 2017 or later. It should be noted that a majority of accounts historically have not converted to amortizing. Based on historical trends, within 12 months of the end of their draw period, approximately 65% of accounts, and approximately 79% of accounts with a balance, closed or refinanced before or soon after converting. We perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure. These activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity second lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent, including when the second lien is still current. In 2012, we initiated the monitoring of delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by other parties. Additionally, we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores of borrowers with second liens, as these scores are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency. At March 31, 2013, our home equity second lien loss severity was approximately 76%. The loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct (consisting primarily of direct auto loans, loans secured by negotiable collateral, and private student loans), indirect (consisting of loans secured by automobiles, marine, or recreational vehicles), and consumer credit cards.          83        The composition of our loan portfolio is shown in the following table:Loan Portfolio by Types of Loans    Table 5(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 % ChangeCommercial loans:     C&I$54,343 $54,048 1 %Commercial real estate4,261 4,127 3Commercial construction634 713 (11)Total commercial loans59,238 58,888 1Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - guaranteed3,930 4,252 (8)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed123,051 23,389 (1)Home equity products14,617 14,805 (1)Residential construction683 753 (9)Total residential loans42,281 43,199 (2)Consumer loans:     Guaranteed student loans5,275 5,357 (2)Other direct2,387 2,396 —Indirect11,009 10,998 —Credit cards614 632 (3)Total consumer loans 19,285 19,383 (1)LHFI$120,804 $121,470 (1)%LHFS$3,193 $3,399 (6)%1Includes $360 million and $379 million of loans carried at fair value at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country.

We continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy, as we were successful in both growing targeted commercial balances and in reducing our exposure to certain higher risk residential and construction loans. Continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios resulted in a combined $149 million decline in these portfolios during the first quarter of 2013 and an $8.7 billion decrease since the end of 2008, which has driven a significant improvement in our risk profile. Average loans 84during the first quarter of 2013 totaled $120.9 billion. See the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section of this MD&A for more information regarding average loan balances.Commercial loans increased $350 million, or 1%, during the first quarter of 2013. Growth was driven by C&I loans encompassing a diverse array of large corporate and middle market borrowers as well as commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans increased $134 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2012. The majority of the increase in this portfolio was due to progress made in increasing targeted commercial real estate loan production, where we anticipate seeing some portfolio growth in coming quarters. Commercial construction loans decreased $79 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2012, primarily as runoff from legacy construction exposure exceeded new extensions within our target population. Given the past stresses and early stage recovery in the commercial real estate market, we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. At least annually and more frequently if credit quality deteriorates, we perform a thorough liquidity and contingency analysis of loans within the commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default by providing a thorough view of borrowers' capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Given the relatively modest population of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with our clients to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client’s financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the client’s and guarantor’s, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes.Residential loans decreased across all residential loan classes during the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in our nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio of $338 million resulted from slightly higher payoffs and charge-offs than new origination volumes. Nonguaranteed residential mortgage loan growth came predominantly from borrowers with high FICO scores (i.e., 760 or above) and lower LTV ratios. Additionally, government-guaranteed residential mortgages decreased $322 million, or 8%, during the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to loan paydowns.Consumer loans decreased $98 million, or 1%, during the first quarter of 2013, driven by a decrease in government-guaranteed student loans and credit cards of $82 million and $18 million, respectively. The decline in government-guaranteed student loans was largely due to net sales of delinquent loans during the quarter and pay downs. The remaining consumer loan classes remained relatively flat.Loans Held for SaleDuring the first quarter of 2013, LHFS decreased $206 million due to increased loan sales, largely offset by an increase in residential mortgage production, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.        Asset QualityOur overall asset quality continued to demonstrate favorable trends during the first quarter of 2013. The gradual improvement in our asset quality trends was driven by the intentional reduction of our higher-risk loan balances combined with a reduction in inflows of NPLs. These items have resulted in an improved risk profile and movement in our loan portfolio towards longer-term balance sheet targets. During the first quarter of 2013, NPLs decreased $80 million, or 5%, largely driven by a decline in residential mortgage NPLs. Our NPLs have decreased significantly since their peak in 2009, down by $4.0 billion, or 73%. At March 31, 2013, the percentage of NPLs to total loans was 1.21%, down six basis points from December 31, 2012. Net charge-offs were $226 million during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $422 million during the first quarter of 2012, a decrease of $196 million, or 46%. During the first quarter of 2013, the net charge-off ratio decreased 62 basis points to 0.76%, the lowest level in five years. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2013. Total early stage delinquencies decreased to 0.78%, the lowest level in several quarters, and a decline of 15 basis points from December 31, 2012. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 0.41% of total loans at March 31, 2013, from 0.48% at December 31, 2012. At March 31, 2013, all residential and consumer loan classes showed improvement in early stage delinquencies compared to December 31, 2012. We expect future early stage delinquency ratio 85improvements to be driven by residential loans, as they are still elevated by historical standards. The overall economy, particularly changes in unemployment, will influence additional improvement.Overall, we are pleased with our improved risk profile and positive trends of our asset quality. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends, with additional improvements propelled by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized credit quality levels.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses consists of both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience is shown in the table below. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to our Annual Report on Form 10−K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and Note 4, "Allowance for Credit Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section within "Critical Accounting Policies" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for further information regarding our ALLL accounting policy, determination, and allocation.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Charge-offsNet charge-offs decreased by $196 million, or 46%, during the first quarter of 2013 compared with the same period in 2012, driven by general improvement in credit quality. The decline in net charge-offs was particularly notable in our commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and home equity portfolios. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.76% during 86the first quarter of 2013, a reduction of 62 basis points from the same period in 2012 and at the lowest level in five years. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for additional policy information related to charge-offs. Provision for Credit LossesThe total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses, as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. During the first quarter of 2013, the provision for loan losses decreased $109 million, or 35%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The change in the provision for loan losses was largely attributable to improvements in credit quality trends and lower net charge-offs during the first quarter of 2013.

Partially offsetting the decrease in the residential loans ALLL was the ALLL related to commercial loans, which increased $19 million during the first quarter of 2013 due to loan growth. The overall decrease in ALLL reflects the continued improvement in the credit quality trends of our loan portfolio as evidenced by improved early stage delinquencies and reductions in higher-risk balances and NPLs. The appropriate ALLL level will continue to be determined by our quarterly review process. We currently expect ALLL levels to remain relatively stable as the continued improvement in asset quality is offset by growth in the loan portfolio. At March 31, 2013, the ALLL to period-end loans ratio of 1.79% decreased 1 basis point from 1.80% at December 31, 2012. When excluding government-guaranteed loans, the ALLL to period-end loans decreased to 1.93% at March 31, 2013, compared to 1.95% at December 31, 2012. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs was 148% at March 31, 2013, compared to 142% at December 31, 2012. The increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $80 million decrease in NPLs, partially offset by the reduction in ALLL.The reserve for unfunded commitments was $53 million at March 31, 2013, an increase of $8 million compared to December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily driven by a single facility that is expected to fund and charge-off in the second quarter of 2013.          87NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe following table presents our nonperforming assets:     Table 9(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 % ChangeNonaccrual/NPLs     Commercial loans:     C&I$205 $194 6 %Commercial real estate59 66 (11)Commercial construction25 34 (26)Total commercial NPLs289 294 (2)Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed721 775 (7)Home equity products334 341 (2)Residential construction102 112 (9)Total residential NPLs1,157 1,228 (6)Consumer loans:     Other direct6 6 —Indirect15 19 (21)Total consumer NPLs21 25 (16)Total nonaccrual/NPLs1,467 1,547 (5)OREO1224 264 (15)Other repossessed assets8 9 (11)Nonperforming LHFS41 37 11Total nonperforming assets$1,740 $1,857 (6)%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$823 $782 5 %Accruing LHFS past due 90 days or more2 1 100TDRs     Accruing restructured loans $2,499 $2,501 — %Nonaccruing restructured loans2655 639 3Ratios     NPLs to total loans1.21% 1.27% (5)%Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO, other repossessed assets, and nonperforming LHFS1.44 1.52 (5)1 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $159 million and $140 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.2 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.Nonperforming assets decreased $117 million, or 6%, during the first quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily attributed to an $80 million, or 5%, decrease in NPLs. All loan classes declined except C&I, which increased 6% primarily driven by several wholesale borrowers. The decrease in NPLs primarily related to reductions in residential mortgage NPLs of $54 million, or 7%, and residential construction NPLs of $10 million, or 9%. The decrease in NPLs was primarily due to net charge-offs, lower inflows, foreclosures, and improved loan performance. At March 31, 2013, our ratio of NPLs to total loans was 1.21%, down from 1.27% at December 31, 2012. We expect NPLs to continue to trend down in 2013 as asset quality improves and loans move through the foreclosure process.Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall NPAs as a result of the devaluation of U.S. housing during the recent economic recession. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may continue to impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the NPA portfolio.Nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, and TDR loans, are problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses that are disclosed in the NPA table above. Loans with known potential credit problems that may not otherwise 88be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans, which are disclosed along with additional credit quality information in Note 3, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, there were no known significant potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed.Nonperforming LoansNonperforming residential loans were the largest driver of the overall decline in NPLs, decreasing $71 million, or 6%, during the first quarter of 2013. The reduction in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs, primarily as a result of foreclosures, net charge-offs, and improved loan performance, accounted for $54 million of this decrease. Residential construction NPLs decreased $10 million, which is primarily attributable to net charge-offs and lower inflows.The decrease of $5 million, or 2%, in nonperforming commercial loans also contributed to the decrease in NPLs during the first quarter of 2013. Specifically, the reduction in nonperforming commercial loans was predominantly driven by a $9 million reduction in commercial construction NPLs and a $7 million reduction in commercial real estate NPLs, largely offset by an increase in C&I NPLs of $11 million.Interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not typically recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero. We recognized $11 million and $7 million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans during first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $22 million and $46 million during first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, would have been recognized.Other Nonperforming AssetsOREO decreased $40 million, or 15%, during the first quarter of 2013 resulting from net decreases of $31 million in residential construction related properties, $5 million in residential homes, and $5 million in commercial properties. During the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $109 million and $121 million, respectively, contributing to net gains on sales of OREO of $22 million and $3 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 52% and 20%, respectively, of OREO at March 31, 2013; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value less estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, total accruing loans past due ninety days or more included LHFI and LHFS and totaled $825 million and $783 million, respectively. Accruing LHFI past due ninety days or more increased by $41 million, or 5%, during the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by guaranteed student loan delinquencies. Residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency comprised 93%  and 92%, respectively, of past due accruing loans at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. As of the same dates, $56 million and $60 million, respectively, of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were not guaranteed.In April 2011, we, along with other servicers, entered into Consent Orders with supervisory regulatory agencies (in our case, the FRB). The Consent Order required us to improve certain processes related to residential mortgage loan servicing. Under the Consent Order, we agreed to retain an independent consultant approved by the FRB to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending or completed at any time during 2009 and 2010 for loans serviced by STM to identify any errors or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial harm, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. On February 28, 2013, we, along with nine other mortgage servicers, entered into an Amendment to the Consent Order with the FRB to conclude the independent foreclosure review and accelerate remediation to all borrowers whose loans were included in the review. See additional discussion in Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Noninterest Expense" section of this MD&A.           Restructured LoansTo maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/89or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extension of terms.Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower financial difficulties are reported as accruing TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market at the time of the modification. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $349 million and $348 million, respectively. See Note 3, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.The following tables display our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status. Guaranteed loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled $26 million and $24 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.Selected Residential TDR Data          Table 10 March 31, 2013 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$509 $49 $558 $45 $44 $89Term extension15 4 19 4 7 11Rate reduction and term extension1,537 133 1,670 75 196 271Other 217 1 18 166 43 209Total$2,078 $187 $2,265 $290 $290 $580             December 31, 2012 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$470 $37 $507 $36 $45 $81Term extension16 4 20 3 7 10Rate reduction and term extension1,562 172 1,734 78 209 287Other 27 2 9 172 39 211Total$2,055 $215 $2,270 $289 $300 $5891 TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.2 Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.At March 31, 2013, our total TDR portfolio was $3.2 billion and was composed of $2.9 billion, or 91%, of residential loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $0.2 billion, or 6%, of commercial loans (predominantly income-producing properties), and $0.1 billion, or 3%, of consumer loans.Total TDRs increased $14 million from December 31, 2012 as nonaccruing TDRs were up $16 million, or 3%, partially offset by a decrease in accruing TDRs of $2 million. The increase in TDRs was primarily due to the policy change effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy that resulted in additional loans being classified 90as TDRs. See additional discussion of the policy change in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10−K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Generally, interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such recognized interest income was $27 million and $29 million during the first quarter of 2013 and 2012. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $36 million and $39 million during the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, would have been recognized.SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUEThe following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Derivative assets decreased $194 million, including the impact of a $45 million increase in cash collateral.Trading liabilities increased $187 million, or 16%, since December 31, 2012, predominantly due to an increase in derivatives and corporate and other debt securities, slightly offset by a decrease in U.S. Treasury securities as a result of normal business activity. Derivative liabilities increased $134 million, partially offset by the impact of a $15 million increase in cash collateral.See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on derivatives.91Securities Available for Sale      Table 12 March 31, 2013(Dollars in millions)AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains UnrealizedLosses FairValueU.S. Treasury securities$805 $15 $— $820Federal agency securities2,211 79 5 2,285U.S. states and political subdivisions280 12 2 290MBS - agency18,618 677 40 19,255MBS - private195 7 — 202ABS153 4 1 156Corporate and other debt securities41 4 — 45Other equity securities1769 1 — 770Total securities AFS$23,072 $799 $48 $23,8231At March 31, 2013, other equity securities included the following: $268 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $402 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, $98 million in mutual fund investments, and $2 million of other.

Securities Available for SaleThe securities AFS portfolio is managed as part of our overall ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the quarter reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio while managing our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile. The increase of $1.9 billion at March 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, was primarily the result of increased holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, government agency securities, and agency MBS, as we opportunistically reinvested the proceeds from fourth quarter loan sales. During the first quarter of 2013, we recorded $2 million in net realized gains from the sale of securities AFS, compared to net realized gains of $18 million during the first quarter of 2012, including $1 million and $2 million in OTTI, respectively. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see Note 2, "Securities Available for Sale," and the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 12, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.For the first quarter of 2013, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 2.57%, compared with 3.17% for the first quarter of 2012. Prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities, reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower yields, and the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock, drove the decline in yield on securities AFS. Our total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 3.3 years at March 31, 2013, compared to 2.2 years at December 31, 2012. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 3.3 years suggests an expected price change of 3.3% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.92The credit quality and liquidity profile of the securities portfolio remained strong at March 31, 2013, and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends and our overall liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment portfolio could change meaningfully over time.BORROWINGS                   Short-Term Borrowings        Table 13 March 31, 2013 Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 Balance Rate Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End(Dollars in millions) Balance Rate Funds purchased1$605 0.09% $716 0.11% $664Securities sold under agreements to repurchase11,854 0.20 1,705 0.19 1,854FHLB advances2,500 0.30 2,000 0.32 2,500Other short-term borrowings21,669 0.29 1,721 0.25 1,813           March 31, 2012 Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 Balance Rate Daily Average MaximumOutstanding atany Month-End(Dollars in millions) Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$908 0.10% $871 0.10% $908Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 11,781 0.15 1,634 0.14 1,781FHLB advances5,000 0.16 7,396 0.15 9,000Other short-term borrowings 21,878 0.56 1,774 0.39 1,8781 Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of the borrowings.2 Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral, and other short-term borrowed funds.Short-Term BorrowingsOur short-term borrowings decreased $2.9 billion, or 31%, from March 31, 2012, predominantly due to a $2.5 billion decrease in FHLB advances as a result of our decision to utilize loan sale proceeds during 2012 to reduce short-term borrowings. We also experienced decreases of $303 million in funds purchased and $240 million in master notes, slightly offset by $73 million and $30 million increases in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and dealer collateral, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, our daily average short-term borrowings decreased $5.5 billion, or 47%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in daily average balances for FHLB advances of $5.4 billion, funds purchased of $155 million, and master notes of $81 million, partially offset by increases in daily average balances for securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $71 million and dealer collateral of $27 million.For the three months ended March 31, 2013, our maximum monthly outstanding balances for funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and other short-term borrowings were not materially different from period-end and daily average balances.Long-Term Debt     On April 26, 2013, we issued $600 million of 10-year senior notes under our Global Bank Note program. The notes pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.75% and will mature on May 1, 2023. We may call the notes beginning on April 1, 2023. There have been no other material changes in our long-term debt, as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, since December 31, 2012.CAPITAL RESOURCESOur primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 93capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Additionally, mark-to-market adjustments related to our estimated credit spreads for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital.Both the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average total assets less certain deductions, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.The concept of Tier 1 common equity, the portion of Tier 1 capital that is considered common equity, was first introduced in the 2009 SCAP. Our regulator, rather than U.S. GAAP, defines Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio. As a result, our calculation of these measures may differ from those of other financial services companies who calculate them. However, Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio continue to be important factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions; therefore, we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital.Regulatory Capital Ratios  Table 14  (Dollars in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 capital$15,319 $14,975Total capital18,392 18,131RWA136,739 134,524Average total assets for leverage ratio165,387 168,053Tier 1 common equity:   Tier 1 capital$15,319 $14,975Less:   Qualifying trust preferred securities627 627Preferred stock725 725Allowable minority interest114 114Tier 1 common equity$13,853 $13,509Risk-based ratios:   Tier 1 common equity110.13% 10.04%Tier 1 capital11.20 11.13Total capital13.45 13.48Tier 1 leverage ratio9.26 8.91Total shareholders’ equity to assets12.29 12.101 At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as calculated under the recent NPR was estimated to be 8.2%. See the "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" section in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the proposed Basel III ratio.At March 31, 2013, our capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements and are expected to comply with the proposed requirements under the Federal Reserve's NPR as discussed in the "Capital Resources" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. During the quarter, our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital increased $344 million, driven by first quarter earnings, resulting in an increase in our Tier 1 common equity ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio. Effective January 1, 2013, the Market Risk Rule promulgated by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators became effective. The application of the Market Risk Rule requires changes to the computation of RWA associated with assets held in our trading account and expanded the calculation to include a stressed VAR measure among other things. These changes increased our market risk RWA by approximately $1.1 billion inclusive of changes in the trading portfolio during the quarter. See the "Market Risk from Trading Activities" section of this MD&A for additional discussion.During the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $27 million, or $0.05 per common share. Additionally, we declared and paid preferred dividends of $9 million during the first quarter of 2013 and $3 million during the first quarter of 2012. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, retained earnings 94of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations totaled approximately $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.During the first quarter we submitted our capital plan for review by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR process. Upon completion of the Federal Reserve's review, they did not object to our planned capital actions. As such, we announced plans during the quarter to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 beginning in the second quarter of 2013, to repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock to be completed between the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, and to maintain dividend payments on our preferred stock. Our Board subsequently approved the common stock dividend increase and preferred stock dividend payments at the April Board meeting. The Board had previously authorized the share repurchase, subject to the non-objection to our capital plan by the Federal Reserve.The composition of our capital elements is likely to be impacted by the Dodd−Frank Act in at least two ways over the next several years. First, the Dodd−Frank Act authorizes the Federal Reserve to enact “prudential” capital requirements which may require greater capital levels than presently required and which may vary among financial institutions based on size, risk, complexity, and other factors. As we expected, the Federal Reserve used this authority in its 2012 NPR seeking to implement the Basel III capital requirements. Second, a portion of the Dodd−Frank Act, sometimes referred to as the Collins Amendment, directs the Federal Reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies, including us, which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depositary institutions, such as SunTrust Bank. We expect that as the Federal Reserve applies these to us over a 3-year period, approximately $627 million in principal amount of Parent Company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities currently outstanding will no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment, but instead will qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment. We will consider changes to our capital structure as these new regulations are published and become applicable to us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThere have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTThere have been no significant changes to our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Credit Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our credit risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Operational Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of our balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately 58% of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, are approximately 42% of total loans. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk.95Market Risk from Non-Trading ActivitiesThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No limit breaches occurred during the first quarter of 2013.The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, which, as described in additional detail below, are employed by management to understand net interest income at risk and MVE at risk. These measures show that our interest rate risk profile is slightly asset sensitive at March 31, 2013. MVE and net interest income sensitivity are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together. Net interest income sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and is considered a shorter term measure, while MVE sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments' respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure. A positive net interest income sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year, asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to balance sheet composition. A negative MVE sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that value of the financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities. One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon, which differs from the interest rate sensitivities in Table 15 which is prescribed to be over a one year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.As the future path of interest rates cannot be known, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to instantaneous moves in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed.    Table 15     Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months1(Basis points)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Rate Change   +2005.3% 4.8%+1002.8% 2.5% -25(1.1)% (0.8)%1Estimated % change of net interest income is reflected on a non-FTE basis.Asset sensitivity has increased slightly from December 31, 2012, predominantly due to a slight decline in our forecasted balance sheet and an increase of fixed rate deposits.We also perform valuation analysis, which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value 96of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. However, MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. At March 31, 2013, the MVE profile indicates changes due to instantaneous changes in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. Market Value of Equity Sensitivity  Table 16     Estimated % Change in MVE(Basis points)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Rate Change   +200(2.6)% (2.4)%+100(0.6)% (0.1)% -25(0.1)% (0.3)%The slight increase in MVE sensitivity from December 31, 2012 is primarily due to a slight increase of asset durations from higher rates. A corresponding increase of net interest income to higher rates, as noted above, is due to a greater mix of floating rate assets than liabilities which would reprice to higher yields over the next year if rates did in fact increase. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.Market Risk from Trading ActivitiesUnder established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading activities using a VAR approach that determines exposure that may arise from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and commodity risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio against established limits. For risk management purposes, our VAR calculation measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. This means that, on average, trading losses are expected to exceed VAR one out of 100 trading days or two to three times per year. While VAR can be a useful risk management tool, it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance. As such, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk. Specifically, scenario analysis, stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits are among other tools also used to actively manage trading risk. In addition to VAR, in accordance with the new Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk Rule (the “Market Risk Rule”), which was effective January 1, 2013, we also calculate Stressed VAR, which is used as a component of the total market risk-based capital charge. We calculate the Stressed VAR risk measure using a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employ a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window that reflects a period of significant financial stress.97The following table presents VAR and Stressed VAR for the three months ended March 31 and VAR by Risk Factor at March 31, 2013:Value at Risk Profile  Table 17     Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 1VAR (1-day holding period)   Ending$8 $4High$8 $5Low$3 $4Average$5 $5    Stressed VAR (10-day holding period)   Ending$22 N/AHigh$42 N/ALow$12 N/AAverage$24 N/A    (Dollars in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 1VAR by Risk Factor (1-day holding period)   Commodity price risk$— N/AEquity price risk$9 N/AForeign exchange risk— N/AInterest rate risk$3 N/ACredit spread risk$3 N/AVAR (1-day diversified) total$8 N/A1 "N/A" - The calculation of Stressed VAR and VAR by Risk Factor under the new Market Risk Rules was not applicable in prior periods.The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VAR, is predominantly comprised of four material sub-portfolios of covered positions: Equity Derivatives, Fixed Income, Interest Rate Derivatives, and Credit Trading. There were no material changes in composition of the trading portfolio during the first quarter of 2013. Higher VAR during the period was primarily driven by Equity Derivatives as a result of increased business volume. The trading portfolio did not contain any correlation trading positions or on or off balance sheet securitization positions during the first quarter of 2013.Effective January 1, 2013, a change to our VAR methodology was implemented and we began using a historical based simulation instead of the previously used Monte Carlo simulation. Current period VAR calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation yielded results that were similar to the historical simulation presented. The change was primarily to ensure our internal modeling approach for VAR was on the same basis as that for Stressed VAR, which is a requirement under the Market Risk Rule.98We compare daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with the corresponding daily VAR-based measures. As illustrated below, for the first quarter of 2013 there were no instances where trading losses exceeded firm wide VAR.Firm wide VAR BacktestingNet trading assets and average balance were $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, for the first quarter of 2013, compared to an ending and average balance of $4.8 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, for the first quarter of 2012.We have valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for all covered positions. Additionally, reporting of trading positions is in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to independent price verification. See Note 10, "Derivative Financial Instruments" and Note 12, "Fair Value Election and Measurement" in this Form 10-Q and "Critical Accounting Policies" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for discussion of valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies.Model risk management: Our model risk management approach for validating and evaluating the accuracy of internal models and modeling processes includes developmental and implementation testing and on-going monitoring and maintenance performed by the various model owners. Our MRMG performs an independent model review for the VAR and stressed VAR models. The model reviews include an evaluation of all the model-owner authored documentation and the model-owner performed monitoring and maintenance. In addition, the MRMG performs its own testing which may include independent results replication, model replication, challenger model development, sensitivity analysis, benchmarking against other models or available metrics, back testing, and outcomes analysis. Due to ongoing developments in financial markets and modeling technological developments, but also for purposes of model enhancement, we review the VAR models on an ongoing basis.Stress testing: We use a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VAR reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of rare and extreme historical but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. In addition to performing firm-wide stress testing of our aggregate trading portfolio, additional types of secondary stress tests including historical repeats and simulations and hypothetical risk factor shocks are also performed. Across our comprehensive stress testing framework, all trading positions across each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and commodity risk) are included. We review stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and make updates as necessary to ensure that both current and potential emerging risks are appropriately captured.Trading portfolio capital adequacy:  We assess capital adequacy on a regular basis, based on estimates of our risk profile and capital positions under both baseline and stressed scenarios. Scenarios consider material risks, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Our assessment of capital adequacy arising from market risk also includes a review of risk arising from material portfolios of covered positions. See “Capital Resources” in this MD&A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 99Liquidity Risk ManagementLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments.The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities (unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets) in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a store of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. At March 31, 2013, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $12.2 billion of unencumbered and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately 94% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital service) for an extended period of months in accordance with our risk limits.We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingency liquidity. These sources of contingency liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. The following table presents period end and average balances from these four sources for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012. We believe these contingency liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs.Contingency Liquidity Sources   Table 18 March 31, 2013 March 31, 2012(Dollars in billions)As of  Average for theQuarter Ended ¹  As of  Average for theQuarter Ended ¹ Excess reserves$1.9 $1.5 $2.2 $1.8Free and liquid investment portfolio securities12.2 11.8 14.7 15.1FHLB borrowing capacity13.7 14.8 13.4 11.3Discount window borrowing capacity18.1 18.3 16.3 16.0Total$45.9 $46.4 $46.6 $44.21Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. At March 31, 2013, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. The Parent Company also retains a material cash position, in accordance with our policies and risk limits, discussed in greater detail below.Contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. At March 31, 2013, S&P maintained a "Positive" outlook and Moody’s, Fitch, and DBRS all maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the "Positive" and “Stable” credit rating outlooks. 100Debt Credit Ratings and Outlook      Table 19 March 31, 2013 Moody’s  S&P  Fitch  DBRS SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits, originated primarily from our retail branch network are our largest and most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits decreased to $127.7 billion at March 31, 2013, from $130.2 billion at December 31, 2012, driven by a seasonal decline in deposits.We also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding increased to $15.6 billion at March 31, 2013 from $15.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits, as well as Fed funds purchased, increased to $4.6 billion at March 31, 2013 from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2012.As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of such securities, of which approximately $1.6 billion of issuance capacity remains available. At March 31, 2013, we have issued several small structured notes for the Parent Company in the aggregate amount of $12 million. The Parent Company also issued $450 million of perpetual preferred stock in December 2012. The Bank maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. At March 31, 2013, the Bank had $36.3 billion of remaining capacity to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, or formal program capacity, and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector.Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. At March 31, 2013, this measure was well in excess of the current limit. Our Board Risk Committee regularly reviews this and other risk metrics. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. There is no Parent Company debt scheduled to mature in 2013. A majority of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, loans to our subsidiaries, and common share repurchases. We may repurchase common stock subject to an annual capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in the CCAR process. Since the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, during the first quarter we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock between the second quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014. We will use existing cash balances at the Parent Company to fund these repurchases. See further details of the authorized common share repurchases in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances.101Recent Developments. On April 26, 2013, we issued $600 million of 10-year senior notes under our Global Bank Note program. The notes pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.75% and will mature on May 1, 2023. We may call the notes beginning on April 1, 2023. The impact of the expiration of the FDIC's TAG program on December 31, 2012 had a very modest impact on deposit balance attrition. The TAG program provided a government guarantee of funds deposited in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. In anticipation of the TAG program expiration, we previously forecasted a modest decline in related deposit balances in early 2013. Deposit attrition during the first quarter of 2013 attributable to the TAG program expiration was a fraction of the Bank's total potential exposure and not meaningful in the context of aggregate deposit decline during the first quarter. Given the nature of the types of depositors affected and the well-publicized program expiration, we do not expect any further material TAG-related impact.Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective. For example, the BCBS published in January 2013 revised standards for the proposed LCR that would require banks to hold unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected cash outflows under a prescribed 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is subject to an observation period that began in 2011, but will be phased-in as a requirement beginning January 1, 2015. While the potential impact of this and other regulatory proposals cannot be fully quantified at present, we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and prudent liquidity management practices.In 2011, the Federal Reserve published proposed measures to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms, pursuant to sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These proposed regulations include a number of requirements related to liquidity that would be instituted in phases. The first phase encompasses largely qualitative liquidity risk management practices, including internal liquidity stress testing. The second phase would include certain quantitative liquidity requirements related to the proposed Basel III liquidity standards. We believe that we will be well positioned to demonstrate compliance with these new requirements and standards if and when they are adopted.Other Liquidity Considerations. As presented below, we had an aggregate potential obligation of $64.8 billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at March 31, 2013. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had $4.0 billion in letters of credit at March 31, 2013, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately $2.1 billion of these letters supported variable rate demand obligations at March 31, 2013.Unfunded Lending Commitments  Table 20(Dollars in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Unused lines of credit:   Commercial$38,538 $36,902 Mortgage commitments18,661 9,152Home equity lines11,592 11,739Commercial real estate1,807 1,684Credit card4,166 4,075Total unused lines of credit$64,764 $63,552Letters of credit:   Financial standby$3,867 $3,993Performance standby49 49Commercial36 56Total letters of credit$3,952 $4,0981Includes IRLC contracts with notional balances of $6.7 billion and $6.8 billion as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.102Other Market RiskExcept as discussed below, there have been no other significant changes to other market risk as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.MSRs, which are carried at fair value, totaled $1.0 billion and $899 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, are managed within established risk limits, and are monitored as part of various governance processes. We recognized increases of $16 million and $67 million in the fair value of our MSRs for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows. We recorded net losses related to MSRs during the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, of $39 million and $6 million, respectively, inclusive of the mark-to-market adjustments on the related hedges. For the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of $110 million and $83 million, respectively.We continue to monitor our holdings of foreign debt, securities, and commitments to lend to foreign countries and corporations, both funded and unfunded. Specifically, the risk is higher for exposure to countries that are experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. At March 31, 2013, we identified five countries in Europe that we believe are experiencing strains such that the likelihood of default is higher than would be anticipated if current economic, fiscal, and political strains were not present. The countries we identified were Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and were chosen based on the economic situation experienced in these countries during 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, and that continued to exist at March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2013, we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries. However, at March 31, 2013, we had direct exposure to corporations and individuals in these countries of $103 million that was comprised of unfunded commitments to lend, funded loans, and a nominal amount of letters of credit. Indirect exposure to these countries was $4 million at March 31, 2013 and consisted primarily of double default risk exposure. The majority of the exposure is the notional amount of letters of credit issued in our role as an agent bank under the terms of a syndicated corporate loan agreement, wherein other participant banks in the syndicate are located in the identified higher risk countries. Overall, gross exposure to these countries continues to be less than 1% of our total assets at March 31, 2013, consistent with our exposure at December 31, 2012.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSSee discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 6, “Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities,” and Note 11, “Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTSIn the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. At March 31, 2013, except for the changes noted within the “Borrowings" section of this MD&A, there have been no other material changes in our Contractual Commitments as described in our Annual Report on Form 10−K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

The increase in net income was driven by lower provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, which more than offset lower revenue. Net interest income was $602 million, a decrease of $32 million, or 5%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decline was driven by lower average loan balances and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by the impact of higher average deposit balances and higher loan spreads. A $1.7 billion, or 4%, decline in average loan balances drove a $12 million, or 5%, decrease in interest income that was partially offset by a 1 basis point increase in loan spreads. The decline in average loans was driven by the $2.0 billion student loan sale executed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and equity line attrition, which more than offset increases in indirect auto and commercial loans. Net interest income related to deposits decreased $26 million, or 6%, compared to the first quarter of 2012, as deposit spreads decreased, partially offset by increases in average deposit balances. Average deposit balances increased $1.0 billion, or 1%. Favorable deposit mix trends continued as low cost average deposit balances increased, offsetting a $2.8 billion, or 18%, decline in average time deposits balances. Provision for credit losses was $99 million, a decrease of $56 million, or 36%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by net charge-off declines of $47 million in home equity lines and $7 million in consumer mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase of $4 million in consumer indirect installment. Total noninterest income was $326 million, a decrease of $13 million, or 4%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was partially driven by the reclassification of certain card rewards costs to offset related revenue, in addition to declines in trust and investment management income and service charges on deposit accounts.  Total noninterest expense was $674 million, a decrease of $57 million, or 8%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by reductions in staff expense, structural expense, and allocated costs. Client utilization of self-service channels has provided opportunities to change staffing models and the retail branch network drove the declines in staff and structural expenses. Wholesale BankingWholesale Banking reported net income of $228 million for the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $70 million, or 44%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase in net income was attributable to declines in provision for credit losses, noninterest income, and noninterest expense partially offset by an increase in net interest income.Net interest income was $462 million, a $9 million, or 2%, increase from the prior year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances. Net interest income related to loans increased $10 million, or 4%, as average loan balances increased $2.8 billion, or 6%, with increases in commercial and tax-exempt loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans. Net 104interest income related to deposits decreased $11 million, or 5%. Average customer deposit balances increased $494 million, or 1% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as lower cost demand deposits increased $953 million, or 4%, while time deposits decreased $366 million, or 17%, and average combined interest-bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts decreased $102 million, or 1%, reflecting a continued shift in customer preference towards demand deposit products.Provision for credit losses was $37 million, a decrease of $64 million, or 63%, from the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by lower commercial real estate net charge-offs.Total noninterest income was $337 million, a decrease of $26 million, or 7%, from the first quarter of 2012. The decline was driven by lower trading revenue and a decline in leasing gains.Total noninterest expense was $426 million, a decrease of $61 million, or 13%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. Continued declines in other real estate related expense, combined with lower staff and product expense, were the primary drivers of the decline and were partially offset by increases in allocated costs.Mortgage BankingMortgage Banking reported a net loss of $21 million for the first quarter of 2013, compared to a net loss of $130 million for the first quarter of 2012, an improvement of $109 million, or 84%. The improvement was driven by declines in provision for credit losses, noninterest expense, and higher noninterest income.Net interest income of $127 million for the first quarter of 2013 was relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2012. Higher net interest income on LHFS coupled with lower funding costs on MSRs was offset by lower net interest income on loans and deposits. Average LHFS were up $844 million, or 38%, driven by higher production and resulted in an increase in net interest income of $2 million. Average loan balances were down $2.8 billion, or 9%, resulting in a decrease in net interest income of $1 million. Total average deposits were up $318 million, or 10%, resulting in a decrease in net interest income of $2 million due to lower deposit spreads.Provision for credit losses was $90 million, a decrease of $76 million, or 46%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The improvement was driven by a decline in net charge-offs, partially attributable to the $26 million in net charge-off related to the transfer to LHFS of nonperforming residential mortgage loans included in the first quarter of 2012, which subsequently were sold in the second quarter of 2012.Total noninterest income of $198 million, increased by $41 million, or 26%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase was predominantly driven by higher mortgage production income, partially offset by lower mortgage servicing income. Mortgage loan production income increased $96 million due to a decline in the mortgage repurchase provision and higher production-related fee income, partially offset by lower gain on sale revenue. Loan originations were $8.8 billion during the first quarter of 2013, compared to $7.7 billion for the prior year, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 15%. Mortgage servicing income of $38 million, decreased $43 million, or 53%, driven by less favorable hedge performance, higher decay, and lower servicing fees. Total loans serviced were $142.3 billion at March 31, 2013 compared with $155.4 billion at March 31, 2012, down 8%.Total noninterest expense was $271 million, a decline of $62 million, or 19%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. Operating losses declined $29 million due to lower compliance-related costs, largely attributed to mortgage servicing and litigation expenses, and consulting expense decreased $18 million, predominantly due to lower costs associated with the Federal Reserve Consent Order. Total allocated costs increased $16 million, while credit and collection services decreased $19 million and other real estate decreased $6 million.Corporate OtherCorporate Other net income for the first quarter of 2013 was $64 million, a decrease of $39 million, or 38%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income as a result of maturing interest rate swaps and lower securities gains.Net interest income was $86 million, a decrease of $41 million, or 32%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was driven by lower income from aforementioned interest rate swaps and a $16 million decrease in income on investment securities due to the foregone dividend income resulting from the sale of the Coke stock in the third quarter of 2012. These declines were partially offset by a decline in the cost of funds. Total average assets decreased $4.6 billion, or 15%, driven by a reduction in the investment portfolio, and the aforementioned sale of the Coke stock. Average long-term debt decreased by 105$2.0 billion, or 20%, compared to first quarter of 2012 primarily due to the repayment of senior and subordinated debt during 2012. Average short-term borrowings decreased $3.6 billion, or 57%, due to repayment of short-term FHLB borrowings. Total noninterest income was $4 million, a decrease of $16 million, or 80%, compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was due to a $16 million decline in net gains on the sale of AFS securities.Total noninterest expense increased $1 million compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase was mainly due to higher legal-related expense, partially offset by lower severance expense.106Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A, which is incorporated herein by reference.Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresThe Company's management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures at March 31, 2013. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at March 31, 2013. Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2013, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of its business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. Although the ultimate outcome of these suits cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of management that none of these matters, when resolved, will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. For additional information, see Note 13, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference.Item 1A.
