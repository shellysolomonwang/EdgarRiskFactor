Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this report, and include risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may face certain risks as a servicer of loans, or also may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could 80adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; changes which are being considered in the method for determining LIBOR may affect the value of debt securities and other financial obligations held or issued by SunTrust that are linked to LIBOR, or may affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even from inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.INTRODUCTIONThis MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. When we refer to “SunTrust,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated). We are a leading provider of financial services, particularly in the Southeastern United States, and our headquarters is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operate under three business segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See Note 15, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for a description of our business segments. In addition to deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services.The following analysis of our financial performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes to consolidated financial statements, and other information contained in this document and our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated financial statements and related information to conform them to the June 30, 2013 presentation. In the MD&A, net interest income, net interest margin, total revenue, and efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding management’s view of particular financial measures, as well as to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided in Table 1, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data."81EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWEconomic and regulatoryModerate economic growth continued in the second quarter of 2013 driven by improvement in labor market conditions, increased household spending, and further strengthening of many housing markets in which we operate. Household spending continued to moderately increase as consumer confidence increased to its highest level since 2008 and borrowing costs remained at relatively low levels. Compared to December 31, 2012, the housing market continued to strengthen as demonstrated by continued price increases, favorable shifts in supply and demand, and some encouraging signs from certain homebuilding activities. However, uncertainty remained about the strength of economic growth amidst a continued elevated unemployment rate that ended the quarter at 7.6%, unchanged from the first quarter and only slightly below the December 31, 2012 level. Further, the global economy continued to recover unevenly as concerns remained over the economic health of the European Union and reports of slowing growth in emerging markets. While some actions were taken during 2012 to ease the European sovereign debt crisis, uncertainty about the sustained financial health of certain European countries continued to exist. During the second quarter of 2013, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed that a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain in effect for a considerable time after its asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve conveyed that it anticipates maintaining key interest rates at exceptionally low levels, at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5% and its long-term inflation goals are not met. As a result of executing its monetary policy, the Federal Reserve continues to maintain large portfolios of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and agency MBS with plans to continue adding Treasuries and agency MBS to its portfolio. However, the Federal Reserve indicated it is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. During the second quarter, driven in large part by the financial markets' expectations regarding future Federal Reserve monetary policy actions, certain market interest rates increased and the yield curve steepened. See additional discussion regarding the second quarter interest rate increase in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" and "Noninterest Income" sections of this MD&A. The Federal Reserve outlook includes moderate economic growth, a gradual decline in unemployment, and the expectation of stable longer-term inflation. CapitalDuring the first quarter, we announced capital plans in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR process and completion of the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan. Accordingly, during the second quarter we increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.10 per common share, which is a $0.05 per common share increase from the prior quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $50 million of our common stock during the second quarter and have plans to repurchase an additional $150 million of our outstanding common stock through the first quarter of 2014. Our capital remained strong at June 30, 2013, as earnings during the first half of the year drove a $655 million increase in our Tier 1 common equity, and our Tier 1 common equity ratio improved to 10.19% compared to 10.04% at December 31, 2012. Our Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 11.24% and 13.43%, respectively, compared to 11.13% and 13.48%, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Overall, our capital remains well above the requirements to be considered “well capitalized” according to current and proposed regulatory standards. See additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity Risk Management” sections of this MD&A.The Federal Reserve issued final rules on July 2, 2013 related to capital adequacy requirements to implement the BCBS's Basel III framework for financial institutions in the U.S. The final rules become effective for us on January 1, 2015 and, based on our current analysis of the rules, we believe that our RWA would increase primarily due to increased risk-weightings for commercial real estate, MSRs, and certain on and off balance sheet exposures, resulting in a decline in our capital ratios. Based on our current and ongoing analysis of the recently published rules, we estimate our current Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, on a fully phased-in basis, would be approximately 9.5%, which would be in compliance with the requirements. See the "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" section in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the estimated Basel III ratio. See additional discussion in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A.Financial performanceContinued credit quality improvement and a significant decrease in expenses drove improvement in our earnings during the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Net income available to common shareholders during the second quarter of 2013 was $365 million, or $0.68 per average diluted common share, compared to $270 million, or $0.50 per average diluted common share for the second quarter of 2012. Total revenue declined moderately as a result of the continued challenging interest rate environment, but offsetting the decline was a 51% decline in the provision for credit losses and a 10% reduction in noninterest expenses. Lower revenues were driven by a 5% decrease in net interest income primarily due to lower rates earned on average earning assets, which were partially offset by lower rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities and a reduction in average long-term debt. As a result, our net interest margin declined by 14 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. The decrease 82in the provision for credit losses was attributable to improved credit quality, while the decrease in noninterest expenses was driven by the abatement of cyclically high credit-related costs and our ongoing efficiency improvement efforts. During the first six months of 2013, our efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios both improved over 300 basis points compared to the first six months of 2012. During the first six months of 2013 net income available to common shareholders was $705 million, or $1.31 per average diluted common share, compared to $515 million, or $0.96 per average diluted common share, during the first six months of 2012. The results for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period of last year were also driven by moderately lower revenue, offset by significantly lower provision for credit losses and an 11% decline in noninterest expenses due to the same factors as discussed for the quarter. As credit metrics are now at lower absolute levels, the favorable impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods. Our asset quality metrics continued to improve during 2013, as NPLs, NPAs, and net charge-offs all declined to five year lows. Total NPLs continued the downward trend from 2012 with a decline of 26% from December 31, 2012, driven by reduced inflows into nonaccrual, continuing resolution of problem loans, and return to accruing status of approximately $220 million of loans previously discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy that exhibited a period of sustained payment performance since being discharged. Declines in NPLs were experienced in most categories, with the largest declines coming from the residential portfolio driven by the Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans. In the third quarter, we expect NPLs will continue to trend lower. OREO declined 25% compared to year end, totaling 0.1% of total assets at June 30, 2013, which was the result of continued disposition of properties, coupled with a moderation of inflows. Our accruing restructured loan portfolio increased compared to December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans returning to accruing status. However, the accruing restructured portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 96% current on principal and interest payments at June 30, 2013. Early stage delinquencies, a leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, declined during the first six months of 2013, both in total and when excluding government-guaranteed loan delinquencies. At June 30, 2013, the ALLL ratio was 1.75% of total loans, a decline of five basis points compared to December 31, 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased 50% and net charge-offs decreased 49% during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012. Provision for loan losses was down 42% and net charge-offs decreased 48% during the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012. The declines during 2013 were the result of improved credit quality. Annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 0.59% and 0.67% during the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively, driven by decreases in charge-offs within each loan segment. In the third quarter, we expect net charge-offs will remain relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Overall, the improved credit metrics have been driven by fewer delinquencies, lower loss severities, and higher prices upon disposition of foreclosed assets, all of which are benefits of an improving housing market. We anticipate future improvements in our overall asset quality will likely be driven by residential loans, as the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized levels. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the “Loans,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” and “Nonperforming Assets,” sections of this MD&A.Average loans decreased 2% and 1% during the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2012. The declines during these periods were a result of lower federally guaranteed student and residential mortgage loan balances due primarily to sales in the second half of 2012, predominantly offset by ongoing growth in C&I loans and our consumer portfolio, excluding guaranteed student loans. Also driving the decline in average loans in both periods was the significant decrease in average NPLs primarily due to our continued resolution efforts and NPL sales in 2012. The percentage of our total loan portfolio that is government-guaranteed was 7% at June 30, 2013. We remain committed to providing financing and fulfilling the credit needs in the communities that we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers. To that end, during the first six months of 2013, we extended approximately $48 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients, an increase of 9% from the first six months of 2012. Overall, loan demand remains moderate, but healthy commercial loan pipelines during the second quarter and gradual improvement in consumer and business confidence provide indications of potential future improvement. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% during the second quarter and the first six months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. The increase during both periods was primarily the result of an increase in noninterest-bearing DDAs and lower cost NOW accounts, partially offset by a decrease in higher cost time deposits. Average time deposits declined 17% and 18%  from the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, as a result of the consumer shift from higher cost to lower cost deposits. The increase over the prior year periods in average consumer and commercial deposits allowed us to further reduce our wholesale and short-term borrowings. Specifically, during the second quarter and first six months of 2013, we reduced our higher-cost wholesale funding sources, primarily long-term debt, on average, by 29% and 24%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. Additionally, we reduced our average other short-term borrowings by 22% and 43% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively. See additional discussions in the "Net Interest Income/Margin" and "Borrowings" sections of this MD&A.83Total revenue, on an FTE basis, decreased 7% and 6% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, driven by lower net interest income, as a result of the continued low interest rate environment, and a decrease in noninterest income, driven by a decline in mortgage-related revenue. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, decreased 5% and 6% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, due to a decrease in our commercial loan swap-related income, the continued low interest rate environment, and lower average earning assets. Additionally, a 67 and 64 basis point decline in yields on AFS securities compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, contributed to the decrease in net interest income. Partially offsetting these declines in asset yields was a decrease in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the consumer shift to lower cost deposit products as well as a significant decline in our long-term debt expense. Our net interest margin was 3.25% for the second quarter of 2013, compared to 3.39% for the second quarter of 2012 and was 3.29% during the first six months of 2013 compared to 3.44% during the same period in 2012. The decline in margin was due to the same factors as noted in the decline in net interest income. Noninterest income decreased 9% and 5% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, driven by decreases in mortgage servicing related income, trading income, other charges and fees, and securities gains, largely offset by a lower mortgage repurchase provision and an increase in investment banking income. Mortgage servicing related income decreased as a result of less favorable net hedge performance, as well as lower servicing fees due to the decline in the servicing portfolio. The mortgage repurchase provision decreased $140 million and $301 million compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, as a result of the third quarter 2012 increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve to a level that reflects estimated losses of remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre-2009 GSEs loan sales. Noninterest expense decreased 10% and 11% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, with about half of the decline driven by lower core operating costs including compensation, consulting, and legal, and the balance due to a significant reduction in credit-related expenses. Decreases in OREO expense drove the decline in credit-related expense, and the elimination of certain expenses associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review drove the decline in legal and consulting expense. The decrease in employee compensation was largely attributable to the reduction in full-time equivalent employees. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, net income available to common shareholders increased 7%, driven by improvement in credit quality as reflected in the 31% decrease in the provision for credit losses that offset slightly lower revenue and slightly higher expenses. The decline in revenue was a result of lower net interest income, driven by a reduction in commercial loan swap income, partially offset by an additional business day and modestly higher earning assets. Additionally, noninterest income declined due to a decrease in mortgage-related income, predominantly all of which was the result of lower gain on sale margins and a decline in net hedge performance, both of which were affected by the mortgage interest rate volatility in the quarter. Largely offsetting the decrease in mortgage-related income was a broad based increase in other fee income categories, led by a 37% increase in investment banking income and an increase in wealth management-related revenue. Noninterest expenses increased $34 million, or 2%, during the quarter as core operating costs were well controlled, but more volatile cyclical costs increased, driven by a specific mortgage-related legal matter and higher collection expenses related to continued resolution of defaulted mortgages, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefits expense and a decline in FDIC expenses. Despite the increase in noninterest expenses during the quarter, we expect the cyclical expenses to continue to decline over time and our focus on achieving our efficiency ratio objectives remains high. While the efficiency ratio increased from the first quarter due to cyclical cost increases and the modest revenue decline, we remain committed to achieving an approximate 65% tangible efficiency ratio in 2013 and to our long-term target of below 60%. See additional discussion of our financial performance in this MD&A. Line of Business HighlightsNet income improved during the second quarter and first six months of 2013 in Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management compared to the same periods in 2012. Reductions in expenses and provision for credit losses offset lower revenue to drive the 21% and 36% increase in net income over the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively. The improvement in credit quality, most notably in our home equity portfolio, drove the decrease in the provision for credit losses. The reduction in expenses was driven by changes to our staffing model and retail branch network as a result of clients increasingly utilizing self-service channels. The decrease in expenses drove the 296 and 227 basis point improvements in our efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios, respectively, compared to the first six months of 2012. Wholesale Banking reported strong results in 2013 that included improved net income compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012 that was led by slightly improved revenue as a result of increased net interest income and decreases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Credit quality improvement in our CRE portfolio drove a 68% and 69% decrease in the provision for credit losses compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively. Noninterest expenses decreased 10% and 11% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, resulting in efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios below 60%. The efficiency and tangible efficiency ratio improved 687 and 633 basis points, respectively, compared to the first six months of 2012.84Mortgage Banking results improved significantly compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses, the mortgage repurchase provision, and noninterest expenses, along with a slight increase in net interest income. Decreases in provisions and expenses were a result of improved credit quality and a continued improvement in the operating environment. The expense decreases helped to mitigate the lower gain on sale margins in 2013 compared to the high levels realized in 2012. Despite the lower margins, revenue on new originations was strong as mortgage production volume was at its highest level since the third quarter of 2009 and increased 10% and 13% compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, respectively, led by an increase of 14% and 18% in refinance activity in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. However, we expect the refinance volume to abate during the second half of 2013, but we believe purchase volume is gaining momentum, albeit not currently at a rate to offset expected refinance declines, with an increase of 3% during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same quarter in 2012.Additional information related to performance of our segments during the quarter can be found in Note 15, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, and further discussion of segment results for the first half of 2013 and 2012, can be found in the "Business Segment Results" section of this MD&A.85SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA   Table 1  Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions, except per share data)2013 2012 2013 2012 Summary of Operations:        Interest income$1,347 $1,492 $2,706 $3,026 Interest expense136 218 274 441 Net interest income1,211 1,274 2,432 2,585 Provision for credit losses146 300 358 617 Net interest income after provision for credit losses1,065 974 2,074 1,968 Noninterest income858 940 1,721 1,816 Noninterest expense1,397 1,546 2,760 3,087 Income before provision for income taxes526 368 1,035 697 Provision for income taxes146 91 297 160 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest3 2 9 12 Net income$377 $275 $729 $525 Net income available to common shareholders$365 $270 $705 $515          Net interest income - FTE $1,242 $1,306 $2,493 $2,648 Total revenue - FTE 2,100 2,246 4,214 4,464 Total revenue - FTE, excluding net securities gains 12,100 2,232 4,212 4,432 Net income per average common share:        Diluted0.68 0.50 1.31 0.96 Basic0.68 0.51 1.32 0.97 Dividends paid per average common share0.10 0.05 0.15 0.10 Book value per common share37.65 37.69     Tangible book value per common share 226.08 26.02     Selected Average Balances        Total assets$172,537 $177,915 $172,175 $177,385 Earning assets153,495 154,890 152,986 154,757 Loans121,372 123,365 121,128 122,954 Consumer and commercial deposits126,579 125,885 127,114 125,864 Brokered time and foreign deposits2,075 2,243 2,122 2,258 Total shareholders’ equity21,272 20,472 21,195 20,364 Average common shares - diluted (thousands)539,763 537,495 539,812 536,951 Average common shares - basic (thousands)535,172 533,964 535,425 533,532 Financial Ratios (Annualized)        ROA0.88% 0.62% 0.85% 0.59% ROE7.12 5.37 6.95 5.16 Net interest margin - FTE3.25 3.39 3.29 3.44 Efficiency ratio 366.56 68.83 65.50 69.17 Tangible efficiency ratio 466.27 68.33 65.21 68.67 Total average shareholders’ equity to total average assets12.33 11.51 12.31 11.48 Tangible equity to tangible assets 58.95 8.31     Capital adequacy at period end        Tier 1 common equity10.19% 9.40%     Tier 1 capital11.24 10.15     Total capital13.43 12.84     Tier 1 leverage9.40 8.15                                      86SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA, continued      (Dollars in millions, except per share data)Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 302013 2012 2013 2012Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures       Net interest income$1,211 $1,274 $2,432 $2,585FTE adjustment31 32 61 63Net interest income - FTE1,242 1,306 2,493 2,648Noninterest income858 940 1,721 1,816Total revenue - FTE2,100 2,246 4,214 4,464Securities gains, net— (14) (2) (32)Total revenue - FTE excluding securities gains, net 1$2,100 $2,232 $4,212 $4,432Efficiency ratio 366.56 % 68.83 % 65.50 % 69.17 %Impact of excluding amortization of intangible assets(0.29) (0.50) (0.29) (0.50)Tangible efficiency ratio 466.27 % 68.33 % 65.21 % 68.67 %         June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012  Total shareholders’ equity$21,007 $20,568  Goodwill, net of deferred taxes of $174 and $156, respectively(6,195) (6,220)  Other intangible assets, net of deferred taxes of $4 and $10, respectively, and MSRs (1,240) (929)  MSRs1,199 865  Tangible equity14,771 14,284  Preferred stock(725) (275)  Tangible common equity$14,046 $14,009  Total assets$171,546 $178,257  Goodwill(6,369) (6,376)  Other intangible assets including MSRs(1,244) (939)  MSRs1,199 865  Tangible assets$165,132 $171,807  Tangible equity to tangible assets 58.95 % 8.31 %  Tangible book value per common share 2$26.08 $26.02  Total loans$122,031 $124,560  Government guaranteed loans(9,053) (12,911)  Loans held at fair value(339) (406)  Total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans$112,639 $111,243  Allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans 61.89 % 2.07 %        87(Dollars in billions) June 30, 2013 Reconciliation of Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio   Tier 1 Common Equity - Basel I $14.2 Adjustments from Basel I to Basel III 7 — Tier 1 Common Equity - Basel III 8 14.2     RWA - Basel I 139.0 Adjustments from Basel I to Basel III 9 9.7 RWA - Basel III 8 148.7 Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio:   Basel I 10.2% Basel III 8 9.5 1We present total revenue- FTE excluding net securities gains. Total Revenue is calculated as net interest income - FTE plus noninterest income. Net interest income is presented on an FTE basis, which adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. We also believe that noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of our performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.2We present a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.3Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.4We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.5We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.6We present a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.7Primarily relates to the impacts of mortgage servicing assets essentially offset by certain disallowed DTAs.8The Basel III calculations of Tier 1 common equity, RWA, and the Tier 1 common equity ratio are based upon our current interpretation of the final Basel III rules issued by the Federal Reserve in July 2013, on a fully phased in basis.9The largest differences between our RWA as calculated under Basel I compared to Basel III relate to the risk-weightings for certain commercial loans, unfunded commitments, and mortgage servicing assets.                88Consolidated Daily Average Balances, Income/Expense, and Average Yields Earned/Rates PaidTable 2  Three Months Ended Increase/(Decrease) June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012 (Dollars in millions; yields on taxable-equivalent basis)AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Income/Expense Yields/Rates AverageBalances Yields/RatesAssets               Loans:1               C&I - FTE 2$54,490 $544 4.01% $50,798 $578 4.58% $3,692 (0.57)Commercial real estate4,262 35 3.27 4,582 42 3.65 (320) (0.38)Commercial construction628 5 3.47 862 8 3.85 (234) (0.38)Residential mortgages - guaranteed3,768 27 2.86 5,853 47 3.19 (2,085) (0.33)Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed22,470 242 4.30 22,707 260 4.59 (237) (0.29)Home equity products14,358 131 3.65 15,066 138 3.69 (708) (0.04)Residential construction559 8 5.46 707 9 5.11 (148) 0.35Guaranteed student loans5,339 50 3.78 7,195 69 3.84 (1,856) (0.06)Other direct2,434 27 4.41 2,186 24 4.37 248 0.04Indirect11,073 94 3.41 10,288 99 3.88 785 (0.47)Credit cards617 15 9.80 537 14 10.35 80 (0.55)Nonaccrual31,374 9 2.76 2,584 6 1.00 (1,210) 1.76Total loans4121,372 1,187 3.92 123,365 1,294 4.22 (1,993) (0.30)Securities available for sale:               Taxable22,834 141 2.46 22,569 176 3.13 265 (0.67)Tax-exempt - FTE2263 3 5.18 375 5 5.32 (112) (0.14)Total securities available for sale - FTE23,097 144 2.49 22,944 181 3.16 153 (0.67)Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell1,107 — — 924 — 0.01 183 (0.01)LHFS3,540 29 3.26 3,352 31 3.65 188 (0.39)Interest-bearing deposits21 — 0.06 22 — 0.26 (1) (0.20)Interest earning trading assets4,358 18 1.60 4,283 18 1.67 75 (0.07)Total earning assets153,495 1,378 3.60 154,890 1,524 3.96 (1,395) (0.36)ALLL(2,143)     (2,323)     180  Cash and due from banks4,453     4,721     (268)  Other assets14,346     15,260     (914)  Noninterest earning trading assets1,699     2,230     (531)  Unrealized gains on securities available for sale687     3,137     (2,450)  Total assets$172,537     $177,915     ($5,378)  Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity               Interest-bearing deposits:               NOW accounts$26,015 $4 0.06% $24,957 $6 0.10% $1,058 (0.04)Money market accounts41,850 13 0.13 41,950 24 0.23 (100) (0.10)Savings5,808 1 0.05 5,169 1 0.11 639 (0.06)Consumer time9,163 26 1.15 10,997 40 1.47 (1,834) (0.32)Other time5,036 17 1.34 6,193 25 1.63 (1,157) (0.29)Total interest-bearing consumer and commercial deposits87,872 61 0.28 89,266 96 0.43 (1,394) (0.15)Brokered time deposits2,038 14 2.54 2,211 22 3.88 (173) (1.34)Foreign deposits37 — 0.13 32 — 0.18 5 (0.05)Total interest-bearing deposits89,947 75 0.33 91,509 118 0.52 (1,562) (0.19)Funds purchased657 — 0.10 810 — 0.11 (153) (0.01)Securities sold under agreements to repurchase1,879 1 0.13 1,646 1 0.18 233 (0.05)Interest-bearing trading liabilities751 4 2.29 751 4 2.36 — (0.07)Other short-term borrowings5,422 3 0.24 6,942 5 0.27 (1,520) (0.03)Long-term debt49,700 53 2.19 13,657 90 2.65 (3,957) (0.46)Total interest-bearing liabilities108,356 136 0.50 115,315 218 0.76 (6,959) (0.26)Noninterest-bearing deposits38,707     36,619     2,088  Other liabilities3,702     4,337     (635)  Noninterest-bearing trading liabilities500     1,172     (672)  Shareholders’ equity21,272     20,472     800  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$172,537     $177,915     ($5,378)  Interest Rate Spread    3.10%     3.20%   (0.10)Net interest income - FTE4  $1,242     $1,306      Net Interest Margin5    3.25%     3.39%   (0.14) 1Interest income includes loan fees of $44 million and $31 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 2Interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 35% and, where applicable, state income taxes to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis.

The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included in the above table aggregated $61 million and $63 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 3Income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. 4Derivative instruments that manage our interest-sensitivity position increased net interest income $225 million and $281 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 5The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income – FTE by average total earning assets.90            Net Interest Income/MarginSecond Quarter of 2013Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $1.2 billion during the second quarter of 2013, a decrease of $64 million, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2012. The decrease was predominantly driven by ongoing compression in earning asset yields, particularly in loans and securities AFS, as a result of the low interest rate environment, a reduction in our commercial loan swap-related income, lower earning assets, and the forgone Coke dividend income as a result of the sale and contribution of our Coke common stock during the third quarter of 2012. These factors were partially offset by a favorable shift in the deposit mix to lower cost products from higher cost products, lower rates paid on deposits, and a significant reduction in our long-term debt expense. As a result of these changes, net interest margin decreased 14 basis points to 3.25% during the second quarter of 2013, compared to 3.39% during the second quarter of 2012. Average earning assets decreased by $1.4 billion, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, driven by a $2.0 billion, or 2%, reduction in average loans, partially offset by an increase of $153 million, or 1%, in our average securities AFS portfolio and a $188 million, or 6%, increase in average LHFS. The decline in average loans was largely due to sales of government guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans during 2012. Average nonaccrual loans also declined 47%, driven by ongoing credit quality improvement and the sales of NPLs during 2012. These decreases were partially offset by growth in C&I loans of $3.7 billion, or 7%, primarily driven by our large corporate and middle market borrowers, and consumer loans, excluding guaranteed student loans, which increased approximately 9% compared to the second quarter of 2012.Yields on earning assets declined 36 basis points to 3.60% during the second quarter of 2013, compared to 3.96% during the second quarter of 2012. The yield on our securities AFS portfolio during the second quarter of 2013 was 2.49%, a decrease of 67 basis points, and our loan portfolio yielded 3.92%, down 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2012. The yield declines were primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and, for loans, by lower commercial loan swap-related income and, for securities, by the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock.We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The largest notional position of these swaps are pay variable-receive fixed interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. At June 30, 2013, the outstanding notional balance of active swaps was $17.3 billion, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared to $13.4 billion at June 30, 2012. In addition to the income recognized from currently outstanding swaps, we also continue to recognize interest income over the original hedge period resulting from terminated or de-designated swaps that were previously designated as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans. Swap-related interest income declined to $100 million during the second quarter of 2013 from $120 million during the same period in 2012. The $20 million decline was primarily due to a decline in income from the maturity of $2.1 billion of active swaps during the second quarter of 2013 and $9.0 billion of previously terminated swaps that reached their original maturity date during 2012 and 2013. We added $2.0 billion of new pay variable-receive fixed commercial loan swaps in the second quarter of 2013 after interest rates increased, which we expect to aid net interest income in the near-term by approximately $7 million per quarter. As we manage our interest rate risk we may purchase and/or terminate additional interest rate swaps. Our notional balance of active swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of 2014 with remaining maturities through 2018, absent any additions or terminations. The average maturity of our active swap notional balances at June 30, 2013 was 2.6 years.The commercial loan swaps have a fixed rate of interest that is received, while the rate paid is based on LIBOR. Estimated quarterly income of these swaps based on current expectations of future LIBOR rates is as follows:    Table 3       Ending Notional Balances of Active Swaps(in billions) Estimated IncomeRelated to Swaps(in millions)Third Quarter 2013 $17.3 $100Fourth Quarter 2013 17.3 100First Quarter of 2014 17.3 100Second Quarter 2014 16.1 96Third Quarter 2014 16.1 90Fourth Quarter 2014 12.6 7391Average interest-bearing liabilities during the quarter decreased $7.0 billion, or 6%, from the second quarter of 2012 and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities were 0.50%, a decrease of 26 basis points. The decrease was predominantly a result of a $4.0 billion, or 29%, reduction in average long-term debt, a $3.0 billion, or 17%, decrease in average higher-cost time deposits, and a $1.5 billion, or 22%, reduction in average other short-term borrowings. These were partially offset by an increase of $1.6 billion, or 2%, in lower cost average interest-bearing deposits. The continued shift toward lower cost deposit products also included an increase of $2.1 billion, or 6%, in average demand deposits compared to the second quarter of 2012. The driver of the decline in average long-term debt was primarily attributable to the redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities during the third quarter of 2012, which had a weighted average rate of approximately 7%, and extinguishment of a $1.0 billion FHLB advance and $1.2 billion of senior notes related to the Coke transaction in 2012. Slightly offsetting these declines, we took advantage of the lower interest rates early in the second quarter of 2013 and issued $600 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.75% coupon. Subsequently, we added $600 million of new pay variable-receive fixed long term debt swaps in the second quarter of 2013 that we expect to aid net interest income in the near-term by approximately $3 million per quarter. The reduction in average other short-term borrowings was due to a reduction in short-term FHLB advances during the second half of 2012. The decrease of 26 basis points on rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to the second quarter of 2012 was primarily driven by a 46 basis point decline in rates paid on long-term debt, driven by the aforementioned redemption and extinguishments, and a 19 basis point decline in rates paid on total interest bearing deposits, which included a 15 basis point decrease in consumer and commercial deposits. The decline in consumer and commercial deposits was a result of the improved funding mix driven by the shift from higher cost deposit products to lower cost deposit products.During the second quarter of 2013, the interest rate environment was characterized by a steepening in the yield curve versus the second quarter of 2012, as rates at the long end of the yield curve increased. More specifically, during the second quarter of 2013, benchmark rates were as follows compared to second quarter of 2012: one-month LIBOR averaged 0.20%, a decrease of 4 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.28%, a decrease of 19 basis points, five-year swaps averaged 1.57%, an increase of 49 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 2.70%, an increase of 75 basis points. During the second quarter of 2013, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25% and the Prime rate averaged 3.25%, both unchanged from the second quarter of 2012. In the coming quarters, assuming current rates remain unchanged, we expect the steeper yield curve to help mitigate the declining trend in net interest margin, as well as provide an increasing benefit to net interest income over time. Specifically, the steeper curve is beneficial to spread income and the positive benefit should be noticed in our financial results over time as existing loans and securities provide cash flows that we can redeploy at higher yields. We anticipate net interest margin to decline by mid-single digits in the third quarter, followed by a more stable margin in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.First Half of 2013For the first six months of 2013, net interest income was $2.5 billion, a decrease of $155 million, or 6%, from the first six months of 2012. The decrease was predominantly driven by the same factors as discussed above for the second quarter related to lower asset yields, a reduction in commercial loan swap-related income, lower earning assets, and the elimination of the Coke dividend income.Average earning assets decreased by $1.8 billion, or 1%. The decrease was driven by reductions of $1.8 billion, or 1%, in average loans and $1.0 billion, or 4%, in average securities AFS, partially offset by an increase of $645 million, or 21% in average LHFS. The factors contributing to the year-over-year changes in earning assets were the same as those discussed related to the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $7.6 billion, or 7%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, predominantly due to a $3.5 billion, or 43%, reduction in other short-term borrowings, a $3.1 billion, or 18%, decrease in higher-cost time deposits, and a $3.0 billion, or 24%, reduction in long-term debt. These were partially offset by an increase of $1.9 billion, or 3%, in lower cost interest-bearing deposits. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 1%, during the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, and included an increase of $2.4 billion, or 7%, in demand deposits, as well as the increase in the aforementioned lower cost interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the decrease in higher-cost time deposits, reflecting the continued shift toward lower cost deposit products. The factors contributing to the year-over-year reduction in average other short-term borrowings and average long-term debt were the same as those discussed related to the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012.The net interest margin was 3.29%, a decline of 15 basis points compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012. Yields on average earning assets declined 36 basis points to 3.65% for the six months ended June 30, 2013, from 4.01% for the six months ended June 30, 2012. The average yield on securities AFS was 2.53%, down 64 basis points from the six months ended June 30, 2012. Prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities, reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower 92yields, and the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock, drove the decline in yield on securities AFS. Also contributing to the decline in yields on average earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2013, was a 39 basis point decline in LHFS, as well as a 32 basis point decline in loans, primarily due to the low interest rate environment and a $57 million decline in our commercial loan swap-related income. Offsetting the decline in the yield on average earning assets, was a decrease of 26 basis points on rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, primarily driven by a 67 basis point decline in rates paid on long-term debt as we were able to repay higher cost debt with our increased lower cost deposits and available cash position. A 16 basis point decline in rates paid on consumer and commercial deposits also contributed to the decrease in interest bearing liability rates paid and was also a result of the improved funding mix driven by the shift from higher cost deposit products to lower cost deposit products.Foregone InterestForegone interest income from NPLs reduced the net interest margin by 2 basis points during the second quarter of 2013 and 3 basis points during the first six months of 2013, compared to a reduction of 9 basis points and 10 basis points during the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, as average nonaccrual loans decreased by $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. See additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the “Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Nonperforming Assets” sections of this MD&A. Table 2 contains more detailed information concerning average balances, yields earned, and rates paid.NONINTEREST INCOME                      Table 4 Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30  (Dollars in millions)2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % ChangeService charges on deposit accounts$164 $167 (2%) $324 $332 (2%)Trust and investment management income130 130 — 254 260 (2)Retail investment services69 62 11 130 120 8Other charges and fees97 111 (13) 186 208 (11)Investment banking income93 75 24 161 147 10Trading income49 70 (30) 91 127 (28)Card fees178 85 (8) 154 164 (6)Mortgage production related income133 103 29 292 166 76Mortgage servicing related income1 70 (99) 39 151 (74)Other noninterest income44 53 (17) 88 109 (19)Net securities gains— 14 (100) 2 32 (94)Total noninterest income$858 $940 (9%) $1,721 $1,816 (5%)1 PIN interchange fee income was previously presented in other charges and fees and is now included in card fees, where other interchange fee income is recorded, for all periods presented.Noninterest income decreased $82 million, or 9%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased by $95 million, or 5%, during the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in noninterest income in both periods was driven by a decrease in mortgage servicing related income due to less favorable net hedge performance, and lower trading income, and less securities gains. Partially offsetting the decrease in both periods was higher mortgage production related income as a result of a significant reduction in the mortgage repurchase provision and higher investment banking income. Other charges and fees decreased during the second quarter of 2013 by $14 million, or 13%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased by $22 million, or 11%, during the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of the prior year. The decrease was due to lower insurance premium income due to a reduction in reinsurance agreements with mortgage insurance companies and lower letter of credit and loan commitment fee income. Investment banking income was $93 million during the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $18 million, or 24%, compared to the second quarter of the prior year, and $161 million for the first six months of 2013, an increase of $14 million, or 10%, compared to the first six months of 2012. The increases were driven by increased syndicated finance and high yield bond origination fees and higher fixed income underwriting fees. 93Trading income decreased $21 million, or 30%, during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012, and by $36 million, or 28%, during the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of the 2012. The decrease was largely driven by lower core trading income impacted by higher interest rates during the second quarter, partially offset by mark-to-market valuation adjustments on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs.Mortgage production related income increased $30 million, or 29%, during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012, and $126 million, or 76%, during the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012 due primarily to the decline in the mortgage repurchase provision (discussed further below) and higher origination fees, partially offset by reduced gain on sale margins. Gain on sale income decreased due to the compression in industry gain on sale margins relative to the historically high 2012 levels. The declining margin trend continued in the second quarter of 2013, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than experienced in recent quarters, as a result of the significant increase in interest rates during the latter part of the second quarter. The higher origination fees were driven by an increased amount of closed loans. Closed loans during the second quarter of 2013 were at the highest level since the third quarter of 2009 and totaled $9.1 billion compared to $8.3 billion for the second quarter of 2012, an increase of $840 million, or 10%. Loan originations during the first six months of 2013 were $17.9 billion compared to $15.9 billion during the first six months of the prior year, an increase of $2.0 billion, or 13%. Mortgage production during the second quarter and first six months of 2013 was comprised of approximately 66% and 73%, respectively, in refinance activity driven in part by the HARP 2.0 program. The HARP 2.0 program contributed approximately 17% and 19% to the total refinance production activity for the current quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. However, with the increase in market interest rates that occurred in the latter part of the second quarter, we expect the refinance volume to abate in the second half of 2013, including HARP refinancing, some of which we experienced in the latter part of the current quarter. Purchase volume, on the other hand, is gaining momentum as it increased 3% from the second quarter of 2012 and home purchase application volume in the current quarter was 25% higher than the second quarter of 2012. While purchase volume is not currently at levels that will entirely offset the expected decline in refinances, it will provide some mitigation. Regardless, mortgage production income could remain under pressure due to the anticipated decline in refinance volume and continued declines in gain on sale margins toward the long-term historical average.The mortgage repurchase provision for the second quarter of 2013 was $15 million, a decrease of $140 million, compared to the second quarter of 2012. For the first six months of 2013, the mortgage repurchase provision was $29 million, a decrease of $301 million, compared to the same period of the prior year. The lower provision was due to the third quarter of 2012 increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve. This was the result of information received during 2012 from the GSEs and our experience related to demands, both of which enhanced our ability to estimate losses related to remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre-2009 GSEs loan sales. The reserve for mortgage repurchases was $363 million at June 30, 2013, a decrease of $269 million from December 31, 2012, resulting from the recognition of losses on resolved repurchase requests. Resolution activity increased on outstanding repurchase requests during the year, as the GSEs seek to complete pre-conservatorship vintage repurchases by the end of 2013. This was evident in a lower pending population, higher charge-offs, and an increase in full file requests during the year. We continue to expect quarter over quarter volatility in future demands and full file requests as we work with the GSEs through the resolution process, but we believe the increase during the year is an acceleration in timing of the expected cumulative requests. We believe our reserve appropriately estimates incurred losses based on our current analysis and assumptions, including GSE repurchase request criteria. However, we are aware of other institutions' disclosures of settlement of legacy repurchase exposures. In the event we were to evaluate specific settlement terms, we would consider all factors, including the benefits of eliminating future losses not currently captured in the reserve and reducing current operating expenses versus the potential loss, if any, of exceeding the current reserve estimate relating to the specific exposures that would be the subject of any such settlement. In the third quarter we expect the mortgage repurchase provision to remain stable. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note 12, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Mortgage servicing related income decreased $69 million, or 99%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and $112 million, or 74%, compared to the first six months of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower servicing fees as a result of less favorable net hedge performance and a smaller servicing portfolio. Net hedge performance is highly sensitive to the market interest rate environment, which was volatile during the second quarter of 2013. As a result, during the second quarter of 2013, the interest rate environment caused the hedge to be only slightly additive to income. Further, mortgage servicing income declined compared to the second quarter and the first six months of 2012 due to higher collection of cash flows (i.e, decay) as a result of the increased refinance activity. At June 30, 2013, the servicing portfolio was $140.4 billion compared to $153.4 billion at June 30, 2012. The decline was driven by the sales of certain loans in the servicing portfolio and the high level of refinance activity.Other noninterest income decreased $9 million, or 17%, during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012, and by $21 million, or 19%, during the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012 primarily due to lower gains from the sales of leases.94Net securities gains decreased by $14 million and $30 million respectively, during the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the repositioning of our portfolio during 2012 to capture better relative value.NONINTEREST EXPENSE                      Table 5 Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30  (Dollars in millions)2013 2012 % Change 2013 2012 % ChangeEmployee compensation$635 $654 (3%) $1,246 $1,306 (5%)Employee benefits102 108 (6) 250 254 (2) Personnel expenses737 762 (3) 1,496 1,560 (4)Outside processing and software187 180 4 365 356 3Net occupancy expense86 88 (2) 175 176 (1)Operating losses72 69 4 111 129 (14)Credit and collection services52 61 (15) 85 116 (27)Equipment expense46 46 — 91 91 —Regulatory assessments41 60 (32) 95 111 (14)Marketing and customer development31 32 (3) 61 59 3Consulting and legal fees18 41 (56) 33 76 (57)Other staff expense12 12 — 23 34 (32)Amortization of intangible assets6 11 (45) 12 22 (45)Other real estate expense1 52 (98) 1 103 (99)Net loss on debt extinguishment— 13 (100) — 13 (100)Other expense108 119 (9) 212 241 (12)Total noninterest expense$1,397 $1,546 (10%) $2,760 $3,087 (11%)Noninterest expense decreased $149 million, or 10%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $327 million, or 11%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012. The significant reduction was due to our continued focus on efficiency initiatives resulting in declines across most expense categories, as well as the abatement of cyclically high credit-related costs. Personnel expenses decreased $25 million, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $64 million, or 4%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012. The decrease for both periods was largely attributable to the reduction in full-time equivalent employees and lower incentive compensation. The decline in the six months was also partially due to an approximate $20 million reduction of incentive compensation expense as a result of the actual 2012 incentive payments made in the first quarter of 2013. Operating losses increased $3 million, or 4%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $18 million, or 14%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012. The decrease for the six month period was driven by declines in litigation-related expenses that tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters and mortgage servicing-related compensatory fees. During the current quarter, operating losses included an expense involving a specific mortgage-related legal matter. While the matter is not fully resolved, based on the information we currently have, it was appropriate to record an accrual during the current quarter for the estimated cost of resolution. See discussion of this matter in Note 14, "Contingencies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Credit and collection services expense decreased $9 million, or 15%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $31 million, or 27%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, driven by lower escrow and servicing advance reserves as a result of the nonperforming and guaranteed loan sales that occurred last year, partially offset by increases in expenses related to the accelerated pace of defaulted loan resolutions during the second quarter of 2013. While collection expenses have declined, they continue to be closely related to resolution of NPAs and, as a result, could experience some volatility as they return to normalized levels.Regulatory assessments decreased $19 million, or 32%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $16 million, or 14%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012 due to declines in our assessment rate, reflecting our reduced risk profile.95Consulting and legal expenses decreased $23 million, or 56%, compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $43 million, or 57%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, predominantly due to the elimination of certain expenses associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review that was part of the Consent Order. We entered into an Amendment to the Consent Order in February 2013 that allowed us to begin eliminating consulting and legal costs of independent third parties providing file review, borrower outreach, and legal services associated with the Consent Order foreclosure file review. For additional information regarding the Consent Order and the Amendment, see Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the “Nonperforming Assets” section of this MD&A.Other staff expense decreased $11 million, or 32%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, driven by declines in severance expenses.Other real estate expense decreased $51 million compared to the second quarter of 2012, and decreased $102 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012. The decrease was predominantly due to a decline in the OREO inventory resulting in lower expenses and loss provisioning and an increase in gains on sales of owned properties during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to losses on sales of owned properties in the same periods of 2012. It is unlikely that gains will continue to largely offset expenses, so future quarterly expenses may increase from the current level, but as the economic environment improves over time, we expect that other real estate expense will continue to be notably lower than the elevated levels during 2012.PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESThe provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the provision for income taxes was $146 million and $297 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 28% and 29%, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, the provision for income taxes was $91 million and $160 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 25% and 23%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in these periods. During the third quarter of 2013, the Company completed an internal reorganization of certain subsidiaries. The reorganization resulted in the realization of a permanent benefit for tax purposes. We expect this tax benefit to materially reduce our provision for income tax expense in the third quarter of 2013. The amount of such reduction has not been finalized and will depend upon a third party appraisal of certain assets. The provision for income taxes differs from the provision using statutory rates primarily due to favorable permanent tax items such as income from lending to tax exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. See Note 9, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for further information on the provision for income taxes.LOANSOur disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the related credit reserves i) describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, ii) provide information on how we analyze and assess credit risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate ALLL, and iii) explain the changes in the ALLL and reasons for those changes. We disclose our loan portfolio by segment and/or by type of loan, which is how we document our method for determining our ALLL. Loan types are further categorizations of our portfolio segments.We report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, purpose, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, which further disaggregate loans based upon common risk characteristics.CommercialThe C&I loan type includes loans to fund business operations or activities, corporate credit cards, loans secured by owner-occupied properties, and other wholesale lending activities. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial and construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as C&I loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner-occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.96ResidentialResidential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans, both guaranteed and nonguaranteed. Residential construction loans include owner-occupied residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or second lien position. At June 30, 2013, 35% of our home equity products were in a first lien position and 65% were in a junior lien position. For home equity products in a junior lien position, we own or service 29% of the loans that are senior to the home equity product. Only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing during 2013, with 96% of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in 2014 or later and 58% in 2017 or later. A majority of accounts historically have not converted to amortizing. Based on historical trends, within 12 months of the end of their draw period, approximately 78% of accounts, and approximately 64% of accounts with a balance, are closed or refinanced before or soon after converting. We perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure. These activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity junior lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent, including when the junior lien is still current. We monitor the delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by other parties. Additionally, we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores of borrowers with junior liens, as these scores are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency. At June 30, 2013, our home equity junior lien loss severity was approximately 87%. ConsumerThe loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct (consisting primarily of direct auto loans, loans secured by negotiable collateral, and private student loans), indirect (consisting of loans secured by automobiles, marine, or recreational vehicles), and consumer credit cards.

However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country. See Note 4, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.97The following table shows the percentage breakdown of our total LHFI portfolio by geographic region:Loan Types by Geography         Table 7 Commercial Residential Consumer June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Geography:           Central124% 27% 21% 21% 15% 15%Florida219 19 25 26 18 19MidAtlantic325 25 39 38 26 26Other32 29 15 15 41 40Total100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%1 The Central region includes Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.2 The Florida region includes Florida only.3 The MidAtlantic region includes the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.Loans Held for InvestmentLHFI remained relatively flat at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012. We continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy, as we were successful in both growing targeted commercial balances and in reducing our exposure to certain higher risk residential and construction loans. Continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios resulted in a combined $164 million decline in these portfolios during the first six months of 2013 and an $8.7 billion decrease since the end of 2008, which has driven a significant improvement in our risk profile. Average loans during the first six months of 2013 totaled $121.1 billion. See the "Net Interest Income/Margin" section of this MD&A for more information regarding average loan balances.Commercial loans increased $1.2 billion, or 2%, during the first six months of 2013. Growth was driven by C&I loans, encompassing a diverse array of large corporate and middle market borrowers, as well as commercial real estate loans. C&I loans increased $1.0 billion, or 2%, from December 31, 2012 driven by growth in our not-for-profit, government, and dealer portfolios. We also had growth in our large corporate lending areas, most notably in asset securitizations, energy, and asset-based lending. Commercial real estate loans increased $181 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2012 with the majority of the increase in the portfolio due to progress made in increasing targeted, high-quality income-producing commercial real estate loan production, where we anticipate seeing further growth. Commercial construction loans decreased $46 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2012, primarily as runoff from legacy construction exposure exceeded new extensions within our target population.Given the past stresses and early stage recovery in the commercial real estate market, we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. At least annually and more frequently if credit quality deteriorates, we perform a thorough liquidity and contingency analysis of loans within the commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default by providing a thorough view of borrowers' capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Given the relatively modest population of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with our clients to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client’s financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the client’s and guarantor’s, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes.Residential loans decreased across all residential loan classes during the first six months of 2013. Government-guaranteed residential mortgages decreased $630 million, or 15%, during the first six months of 2013. The change was the result of payments and payoffs primarily driven by refinance activity. Nonguaranteed residential mortgage loan originations were primarily to borrowers with strong credit characteristics (e.g., average FICO scores above 760) and were secured by residential properties with LTVs that averaged below 80%. Consumer loans increased $323 million, or 2%, during the first six months of 2013, driven by increases in government-guaranteed student loans of $74 million, other direct loans of $87 million, and indirect loans of $153 million. The increase 98was largely due to strong demand for loans secured by cars and light duty trucks resulting from the highest U.S. automobile sales since 2007.Loans Held for SaleDuring the first six months of 2013, LHFS increased $248 million compared to December 31, 2012 due to normal fluctuations in the timing of closing new mortgage LHFS and the ultimate sale of these loans to third parties, primarily GSEs.        Asset QualityOur asset quality continued to trend favorably during the first six months of 2013, driven by the intentional reduction of our higher-risk loan balances combined with lower inflows of NPLs. These items have resulted in an improved risk profile and movement in our loan portfolio towards longer-term balance sheet targets. During the first six months of 2013, NPLs decreased $406 million, or 26%, largely the result of a decline in residential mortgage NPLs. Partially driving the decline was the reclassification of approximately $220 million of loans previously discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy to accruing status during the period as they exhibited a six month period of payment performance since being discharged. Our NPLs have decreased significantly since their peak in 2009, down by $4.4 billion, or 79%. At June 30, 2013, the percentage of NPLs to total loans was 0.94%, down 33 basis points from December 31, 2012. We anticipate NPLs will continue to decline in the third quarter of 2013.Net charge-offs were $179 million and $405 million compared to $350 million and $772 million during the second quarter and first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Net charge-offs decreased $171 million, or 49%, and $367 million, or 48%, during the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively. During the second quarter and first six months of 2013, the net charge-off ratio fell to the lowest level in over five years; 0.59% and 0.67%, respectively, compared to 1.14% and 1.26% during the same periods in 2012, respectively. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter. Total early stage delinquencies decreased to 0.71%, the lowest level since June 2006, and a decline of 22 basis points from December 31, 2012. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 0.40% of total loans at June 30, 2013, from 0.48% at December 31, 2012. At June 30, 2013, all residential and consumer loan classes, except other direct consumer loans, showed improvement in early stage delinquencies compared to December 31, 2012. We expect any future early stage delinquency ratio improvements to be driven by residential loans, as they are still elevated by historical standards. The overall economy, particularly changes in unemployment, will influence additional improvement.Overall, we are pleased with our improved risk profile and positive trends of our asset quality. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends, with additional improvements influenced by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized credit quality levels.99ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses consists of both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience is shown in the table below. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10−K, and Note 5, "Allowance for Credit Losses," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, as well as the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section within "Critical Accounting Policies" in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our ALLL accounting policy, determination, and allocation.

Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful. Charge-offsNet charge-offs decreased by $171 million, or 49%, during the second quarter of 2013 compared with the same period in 2012, driven by general improvement in credit quality. For the first six months of 2013, net charge-offs decreased by $367 million, or 48%, compared to the first six months of 2012. The decline in net charge-offs was particularly notable in our residential mortgage, home equity, and residential construction portfolios. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.59% during the second quarter of 2013, a reduction of 55 basis points from the same period in 2012 and at the lowest level 100in over five years. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional policy information related to charge-offs. Provision for Credit LossesThe total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses, as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. During the second quarter of 2013, the provision for loan losses decreased $150 million, or 50%, compared to the second quarter of 2012. For the first six months of 2013, the provision for loan losses decreased $259 million, or 42%, compared to the same period in 2012. The change in the provision for loan losses was largely attributable to improvements in credit quality trends and lower net charge-offs during the first half of 2013.           ALLL and Reserve for Unfunded CommitmentsAllowance for Loan Losses by Loan Segment Table 9 June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012(Dollars in millions)ALLL  Segment ALLLas a % oftotal ALLL Loan segmentas a % oftotal loans ALLL Segment ALLLas a % oftotal ALLL Loan segmentas a % oftotal loansCommercial loans$919 43% 49% $902 41% 48%Residential loans1,046 49 35 1,131 52 36Consumer loans160 8 16 141 7 16Total$2,125 100% 100% $2,174 100% 100%The ALLL decreased by $49 million, or 2%, during the first six months of 2013, driven by the ALLL related to residential loans that decreased by $85 million. Partially offsetting the decrease in the residential loans ALLL was the ALLL related to consumer loans and commercial loans, which increased $19 million and $17 million, respectively, due to loan growth during the first six months of 2013. The overall decrease in ALLL reflects the continued improvement in the credit quality trends of our loan portfolio as evidenced by improved early stage delinquencies and reductions in higher-risk balances and NPLs. The appropriate ALLL level will continue to be determined by our quarterly review process. We currently expect ALLL levels relative to total loans to remain relatively stable as the anticipated continued improvement in asset quality is offset by anticipated loan growth. At June 30, 2013, the ALLL to period-end loans ratio of 1.75% decreased 5 basis point from 1.80% at December 31, 2012. When excluding government-guaranteed loans, the ALLL to period-end loans decreased to 1.89% at June 30, 2013, compared to 1.95% at December 31, 2012. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs was 188% at June 30, 2013, compared to 142% at December 31, 2012. The increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the $406 million decrease in NPLs, partially offset by the modest reduction in ALLL.          101NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe following table presents our nonperforming assets:     Table 10(Dollars in millions)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 % ChangeNonaccrual/NPLs     Commercial loans:     C&I$227 $194 17 %Commercial real estate54 66 (18)Commercial construction23 34 (32)Total commercial NPLs304 294 3Residential loans:     Residential mortgages - nonguaranteed516 775 (33)Home equity products225 341 (34)Residential construction84 112 (25)Total residential NPLs825 1,228 (33)Consumer loans:     Other direct4 6 (33)Indirect8 19 (58)Total consumer NPLs12 25 (52)Total nonaccrual/NPLs1,141 1,547 (26)OREO1198 264 (25)Other repossessed assets8 9 (11)Nonperforming LHFS48 37 30Total nonperforming assets$1,395 $1,857 (25)%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$1,005 $782 29 %Accruing LHFS past due 90 days or more1 1 —TDRs     Accruing restructured loans $2,781 $2,501 11 %Nonaccruing restructured loans2415 639 (35)Ratios     NPLs to total loans0.94% 1.27% (26)%Nonperforming assets to total loans plus OREO, other repossessed assets, and nonperforming LHFS1.14 1.52 (25)1 Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled $177 million and $140 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.2 Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.Nonperforming assets decreased $462 million, or 25%, during first six months of 2013. The decrease was primarily attributed to a $406 million, or 26%, decrease in NPLs. All loan classes declined except C&I, which increased $33 million, or 17%. Net charge-offs, lower inflows, foreclosures, and improved loan performance contributed to the decrease in NPLs. Specifically, the decrease in NPLs related primarily to reductions in residential mortgage NPLs of $259 million, or 33%, and home equity products NPLs of $116 million, or 34%. The decrease in residential mortgage NPLs was primarily due to the return of approximately $220 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans, which were current at least six months from the discharge date, to accruing TDR status. See additional discussion of these Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. At June 30, 2013, our ratio of NPLs to total loans was 0.94%, down from 1.27% at December 31, 2012. We expect NPLs to continue to trend down in the third quarter as housing markets and asset quality improves and loans move through the foreclosure process. The performance of the residential real estate portfolios will be a prime influence on NPL balances.Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall NPAs as a result of the devaluation of U.S. housing during the recent economic recession. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may continue to impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the NPA portfolio.102Nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, and TDR loans, are problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses that are disclosed in the NPA table above. Loans with known potential credit problems that may not otherwise be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans, which are disclosed along with additional credit quality information in Note 4, “Loans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, there were no known significant potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed.Nonperforming LoansThe increase of $10 million, or 3%, in nonperforming commercial loans partially offset the decrease in total NPLs during the first six months of 2013. The increase in nonperforming commercial loans was predominantly driven by a $33 million increase in C&I NPLs, largely offset by a $12 million reduction in commercial real estate NPLs and an $11 million reduction in commercial construction NPLs. The increase in C&I NPLs was driven by a limited number of wholesale loans. Nonperforming residential loans were the largest driver of the overall decline in NPLs, decreasing $403 million, or 33%, during the first six months of 2013. The reduction in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs and home equity products NPLs accounted for $259 million and $116 million, respectively, of this decrease, primarily as a result of certain Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans returning to accruing status, in addition to foreclosures, net charge-offs, and improved loan performance. Additionally, residential construction NPLs decreased $28 million, primarily as a result of net charge-offs.Interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not generally recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero. We recognized $9 million and $6 million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans during second quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $20 million and $14 million for the first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $20 million and $41 million during second quarter of 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $43 million and $87 million for first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, would have been recognized.Other Nonperforming AssetsOREO decreased $66 million, or 25%, during the first six months of 2013 as a result of net decreases of $48 million in residential construction related properties and $19 million in commercial properties, offset by an increase of $1 million in residential homes. During the first six months of 2013 and 2012, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of $205 million and $259 million, respectively, contributing to net gains on sales of OREO of $41 million and $3 million, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note 13, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information. Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised 62% and 14%, respectively, of OREO at June 30, 2013; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value less estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in values could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, total accruing loans past due ninety days or more included LHFI and LHFS and totaled $1.0 billion and $783 million, respectively. Accruing LHFI past due ninety days or more increased by $223 million, or 29%, during the first six months of 2013, primarily driven by guaranteed student loan delinquencies. Residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency comprised 95% and 92%, respectively, of past due accruing loans at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. As of the same dates, $48 million and $60 million, respectively, of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were not guaranteed.In April 2011, we, along with other servicers, entered into Consent Orders with supervisory regulatory agencies (in our case, the FRB). The Consent Order required us to improve certain processes related to residential mortgage loan servicing. Under the Consent Order, we agreed to retain an independent consultant approved by the FRB to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending or completed at any time during 2009 and 2010 for loans serviced by STM to identify any errors or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial harm, and prepare a written report detailing the findings. On February 28, 2013, we, along with nine other mortgage servicers, entered into an Amendment to the Consent Order with the FRB to conclude the independent foreclosure review and accelerate remediation to all borrowers whose loans were included in the review. During the second quarter of 2013, an independent agent approved by the Federal Reserve began 103administering lump-sum remediation payments to borrowers. See additional discussion in Note 14, “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and the "Noninterest Expense" section of this MD&A.          Restructured LoansTo maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform an in-depth and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan’s risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extension of terms.Loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower financial difficulties are reported as TDRs. Accruing loans may retain accruing status at the time of restructure and is determined by, among other things, the nature of the restructure, the borrower's repayment history, and the borrower's repayment capacity. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a sustainable history of repayment performance, typically six months, in accordance with their modified terms are generally reclassified to accruing TDR status. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market at the time of the modification. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were $347 million and $348 million, respectively. See Note 4, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for more information.Representatives of the United States Attorneys' Office for the Western District of Virginia (USAO) and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (collectively the “Government”) have advised STM of the status of their ongoing investigation of STM's administration of HAMP. The Government's investigation focuses on whether, during 2009 and 2010, STM harmed borrowers and violated civil or criminal laws by making misrepresentations and failing to properly process applications for modifications of certain mortgages owned by the GSEs pursuant to the HAMP guidelines. The Government has advised STM that it has made no determinations about how it will proceed in this matter, and STM continues to cooperate with the investigation and believes that it has substantial defenses to the asserted allegations.

Guaranteed loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled $29 million and $24 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.Selected Residential TDR Data          Table 11 June 30, 2013 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$566 $60 $626 $23 $43 $66Term extension16 6 22 2 5 7Rate reduction and term extension1,537 150 1,687 21 168 189Other 2196 7 203 23 71 94Total$2,315 $223 $2,538 $69 $287 $356             December 31, 2012 Accruing TDRs Nonaccruing TDRs(Dollars in millions)Current Delinquent1 Total Current Delinquent1 TotalRate reduction$470 $37 $507 $36 $45 $81Term extension16 4 20 3 7 10Rate reduction and term extension1,562 172 1,734 78 209 287Other 27 2 9 172 39 211Total$2,055 $215 $2,270 $289 $300 $5891 TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.2 Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.At June 30, 2013, our total TDR portfolio was $3.2 billion and was composed of $2.9 billion, or 91%, of residential loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit), $200 million, or 6%, of commercial loans (predominantly income-producing properties), and $103 million, or 3%, of consumer loans.Total TDRs increased $56 million from December 31, 2012. Accruing TDRs were up $280 million, or 11%, largely offset by a decrease in nonaccruing TDRs of $224 million, or 35%. The increase in accruing TDRs was primarily due to the return of approximately $220 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans to accruing TDR status from nonaccruing TDR. See additional discussion in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.Generally, interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such recognized interest income was $30 million during the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, and $56 million and $59 million for the first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of $40 million during the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, and $76 million and $79 million for the first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, would have been recognized.105SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUEThe following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Trading Assets and LiabilitiesTrading assets decreased $225 million, or 4%, since December 31, 2012, as a result of normal changes in the trading portfolio product mix, primarily due to a decrease in derivatives, partially offset by increases in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities. Derivative assets decreased $458 million, including the impact of a $200 million decrease in cash collateral.Trading liabilities were relatively flat compared to December 31, 2012, as a decrease in U.S. Treasury securities was offset by increases in corporate and other debt securities and derivatives as a result of normal business activity. Derivative liabilities increased $63 million, including the impact of a $308 million decrease in cash collateral.See Note 11, "Derivative Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information on derivatives.106Securities Available for Sale      Table 13 June 30, 2013(Dollars in millions)AmortizedCost UnrealizedGains UnrealizedLosses FairValueU.S. Treasury securities$793 $7 $22 $778Federal agency securities2,203 57 38 2,222U.S. states and political subdivisions248 10 2 256MBS - agency18,784 453 324 18,913MBS - private181 1 1 181ABS124 2 1 125Corporate and other debt securities37 3 — 40Other equity securities1873 1 — 874Total securities AFS$23,243 $534 $388 $23,3891At June 30, 2013, other equity securities included the following: $334 million in FHLB of Atlanta stock, $402 million in Federal Reserve Bank stock, $137 million in mutual fund investments, and $1 million of other.

Securities Available for SaleThe securities AFS portfolio is managed as part of our overall ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the six months reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio while managing our interest rate and liquidity risk profile. The increase of $1.4 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, was primarily the result of increased holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, government agency securities, and agency MBS, as we opportunistically reinvested the proceeds from fourth quarter loan sales. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we recorded $2 million in net realized gains from the sale of securities AFS, compared to net realized gains of $32 million during the six months ended June 30, 2012 , including $1 million and $4 million in OTTI, respectively. The $32 million in gains during 2012 reflected our repositioning of the portfolio to capture better relative value. Compared to year end, the decrease in net unrealized gains at June 30, 2013 was driven by the increase in market interest rates during the second quarter. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see Note 3, "Securities Available for Sale," and the “Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale” section of Note 13, “Fair Value Election and Measurement,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.For the second quarter of 2013, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 2.49%, compared with 3.16% for the second quarter of 2012. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio was 2.53%, compared with 3.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities, reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower yields, and the foregone dividend income on the Coke common stock, drove the decline in yield on securities AFS. Our total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 4.2 years at June 30, 2013, compared to 2.2 years at December 31, 2012. The increase in the effective duration is the result of reinvestment of securities' cash flow and proceeds from the fourth quarter loan sales into longer duration holdings, 107which is reflective of our overall management of interest rate risk. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of 4.2 years suggests an expected price change of 4.2% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.The credit quality and liquidity profile of the securities portfolio remained strong at June 30, 2013, and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns. Over the longer term, the size and composition of the investment portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends and our overall liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives. Accordingly, the size and composition of the investment portfolio could change meaningfully over time.BORROWINGS                               Short-Term Borrowings              Table 14 June 30, 2013 Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 Balance Rate Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End(Dollars in millions) Balance Rate  Balance Rate Funds purchased1$420 0.07% $657 0.10% $1,000 $686 0.10% $1,000Securities sold underagreements to repurchase11,869 0.18 1,879 0.13 1,869 1,793 0.16 1,869FHLB advances3,950 0.23 3,619 0.25 3,950 2,814 0.27 3,950Other short-term borrowings21,875 0.28 1,803 0.21 1,875 1,762 0.23 1,875                 June 30, 2012 Three Months Ended June 30, 2012 Six Months Ended June 30, 2012 Balance Rate Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End Daily Average Maximum Outstanding at any Month-End(Dollars in millions) Balance Rate  Balance Rate Funds purchased 1$847 0.09% $810 0.11% $847 $840 0.11% $908Securities sold underagreements to repurchase 11,583 0.20 1,646 0.18 1,710 1,640 0.16 1,781FHLB advances5,500 0.28 5,225 0.25 5,500 6,310 0.20 9,000Other short-term borrowings 21,598 0.53 1,717 0.32 1,875 1,746 0.36 1,8781 Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of the borrowings.2 Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral, and other short-term borrowed funds.Short-Term BorrowingsOur period-end short-term borrowings decreased $1.4 billion, or 15%, from June 30, 2012, predominantly due to a $1.6 billion decrease in FHLB advances as a result of our decision to utilize a portion of loan sale proceeds during 2012 to reduce short-term borrowings. We also experienced a decrease of $427 million in funds purchased, offset by increases of $286 million and $252 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and master notes, respectively. Daily average short-term borrowings decreased $1.4 billion, or 15%, compared to the second quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in daily average balances for FHLB advances of $1.6 billion and funds purchased of $153 million partially offset by increases in daily average balances of $233 million and $70 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and master notes, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, our daily average short-term borrowings decreased $3.5 billion, or 33%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to a decrease in daily average balance for FHLB advances of $3.5 billion and a decline in the daily average balance for funds purchased of $154 million, offset by an increase in daily average balance for securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $153 million.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, our maximum monthly outstanding balances for funds purchased was higher than our period-end balance as a result of increased activity in funds purchased during the second quarter of 2013, due to ordinary balance sheet management practices. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, our maximum monthly outstanding balance for FHLB advances was higher than the daily average balance as a result of increased borrowing during the second quarter of 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, our maximum monthly outstanding balance for FHLB advances was higher than our period-end balance as a result of higher FHLB borrowings at certain points during the six months ended June 30, 2012, due to ordinary balance sheet management practices.108Long-Term Debt     During the six months ended June 30, 2013, our long-term debt increased $461 million. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $600 million of 10-year senior notes under our Global Bank Note program during the second quarter, partially offset by a $102 million decrease in direct finance leases due to paydowns. The senior notes pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.75% and will mature on May 1, 2023. We may call the notes beginning on April 1, 2023. There have been no other material changes in our long-term debt, as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, since December 31, 2012.CAPITAL RESOURCESOur primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Additionally, mark-to-market adjustments related to our estimated credit spreads for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital.Both the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively. To be considered “well-capitalized,” ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average total assets less certain deductions, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively. On July 2, the Federal Reserve published new rules related to required minimum capital ratios that become effective for us on January 1, 2015. See further discussion below under "Basel III."The concept of Tier 1 common equity, the portion of Tier 1 capital that is considered common equity, was first introduced in the 2009 SCAP. Our regulator, rather than U.S. GAAP, defines Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio. As a result, our calculation of these measures may differ from those of other financial services companies who calculate them. However, Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio continue to be important factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions; therefore, we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital.Effective January 1, 2013, the Market Risk Rule promulgated by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators became effective. The application of the Market Risk Rule required changes to the computation of RWA associated with assets held in our trading account and expanded the calculation to include a stressed VAR measure among other things. See the "Market Risk from Trading Activities" section of this MD&A for additional discussion.Regulatory Capital Ratios  Table 15  (Dollars in millions)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 capital$15,631 $14,975Total capital18,664 18,131RWA139,010 134,524Average total assets for leverage ratio166,261 168,053Tier 1 common equity:   Tier 1 capital$15,631 $14,975Less:   Qualifying trust preferred securities627 627Preferred stock725 725Allowable minority interest115 114Tier 1 common equity$14,164 $13,509Risk-based ratios:   Tier 1 common equity110.19% 10.04%Tier 1 capital11.24 11.13Total capital13.43 13.48Tier 1 leverage ratio9.40 8.91Total shareholders’ equity to assets12.25 12.101 At June 30, 2013 our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as calculated under the final Basel III capital rules was estimated to be 9.5%. See the "Reconcilement of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures" section in this MD&A for a reconciliation of the current Basel I ratio to the estimated Basel III ratio.109At June 30, 2013, our capital ratios are well above current regulatory requirements with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios improving from their December 31, 2012 levels, while our total capital ratio remains relatively stable. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital increases were driven by increased retained earnings, and our RWA increased, partially due to the change in RWA computation as a result of the Market Risk Rule. The net effect of these increases was an increase in our Tier 1 common equity ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we declared and paid common dividends totaling $81 million, or $0.15 per common share, compared with $54 million, or $0.10 per common share during the six months ended June 30, 2012. Additionally, we declared and paid preferred dividends during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 of $18 million and $6 million, respectively. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, retained earnings of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations totaled approximately $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.During the first quarter of 2013, we submitted our capital plan for review by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with the 2013 CCAR process. Upon completion of the Federal Reserve's review, they did not object to our planned capital actions. As such, we maintained dividend payments on our preferred stock during the first half of 2013, increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 beginning in the second quarter of 2013, and announced the repurchase of up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock to be completed between the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million, or approximately 1.7 million shares, of our outstanding common stock, with plans to repurchase the remaining $150 million by the end of the first quarter of 2014. Basel IIIThe composition of our capital elements will be impacted by the Dodd−Frank Act in at least two ways over the next several years. First, the Dodd−Frank Act authorizes the Federal Reserve to enact “prudential” capital requirements which require greater capital levels than presently required and which vary among financial institutions based on size, risk, complexity, and other factors. As expected, the Federal Reserve used this authority in its new capital rules published on July 2, 2013, seeking to implement the Basel III capital requirements. Second, a portion of the Dodd−Frank Act, sometimes referred to as the Collins Amendment, directs the Federal Reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies, including us, which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depositary institutions, such as SunTrust Bank. On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve issued final rules addressing implementation of the Basel III capital requirements, which require banking organizations such as SunTrust to begin compliance on January 1, 2015 with the revised minimum regulatory capital ratios and begin the transition period for the revised definitions of regulatory capital and the revised regulatory capital adjustments and deductions, as well as begin compliance with the standardized approach for determining RWA. Furthermore, beginning January 1, 2016, these banking organizations are required to begin the transition period for capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers, which places restrictions on the amount of retained earnings that may be used for distributions or discretionary bonus payments. Additional rules, known as the Advanced Approaches rules, require additional measurement of RWA as well as separate calculation of qualifying capital instruments. The Advanced Approaches rules generally apply to banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, or that have total on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more. Accordingly, SunTrust is not currently required to comply with these separate requirements. Under the final rules, the minimum capital requirements remain unchanged from the rules proposed by the Federal Reserve in 2012, with thresholds for Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%; Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6%; Total Capital ratio of 8%; and U.S. Leverage ratio of 4%. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWA also remains applicable. As of June 30, 2013, we believe each of our regulatory capital ratios exceeds their respective "adequately capitalized" minimums under the final rules, as well as the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, when measured on a fully-phased-in basis.Also unchanged from the NPR capital rule is the final Basel III capital rules requiring the phase out of non-qualifying Tier 1 Capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities. As such, over a 2-year period beginning on January 1, 2015, approximately $627 million in principal amount of Parent Company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities currently outstanding will no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment, but instead will qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment. Accordingly, we anticipate that, by January 1, 2016, all $627 million of our outstanding trust preferred securities will lose Tier 1 capital treatment, and will be reclassified as Tier 2 capital. We anticipate the impact of this to result in an approximately 40 basis point reduction in our Tier 1 capital ratio. We do not expect any impact to our total capital ratio as a result of the transition to Tier 2 capital.110CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThere have been no significant changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENTThere have been no significant changes to our Enterprise Risk Management as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our credit risk management practices as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Operational Risk ManagementThere have been no significant changes in our operational risk management practices as described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of our balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately 56% of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, are approximately 42% of total loans. We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk.Market Risk from Non-Trading ActivitiesThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. No limit breaches occurred during the first six months of 2013.The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, which, as described in additional detail below, are employed by management to understand net interest income at risk and MVE at risk. These measures show that our interest rate risk profile is slightly asset sensitive at June 30, 2013. MVE and net interest income sensitivity are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together. Net interest income sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and is considered a shorter term measure, while MVE sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments' respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure. A positive net interest income sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year, asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to balance sheet composition. A negative MVE sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that value of the financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities. One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon, which differs from the interest rate sensitivities in Table 16 which are prescribed to be over a one year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis 111incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.As the future path of interest rates cannot be known, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to instantaneous moves in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed.    Table 16     Estimated % Change in Net Interest IncomeOver 12 Months1(Basis points)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Rate Change   +2002.3% 4.8%+1001.3% 2.5% -25(0.7)% (0.8)%1Estimated % change of net interest income is reflected on a non-FTE basis.The decrease in asset sensitivity from December 31, 2012 is predominantly due to slower assumed prepayments on mortgage-related products due to higher long-term rates and balance sheet mix changes, including new commercial loan swaps. Net interest income increases due to higher rates are less than those estimated at December 31, 2012, due to a decline in floating rate assets relative to liabilities which would reprice to higher yields over the next year if rates did in fact increase.We also perform valuation analysis, which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. However, MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. At June 30, 2013, the MVE profile indicates changes in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous changes in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. Market Value of Equity Sensitivity  Table 17     Estimated % Change in MVE(Basis points)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Rate Change   +200(6.0)% (2.4)%+100(2.6)% (0.1)% -250.4% (0.3)%The increase in MVE sensitivity from December 31, 2012 is primarily due to a slight increase in asset durations from higher rates. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, 112MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.Market Risk from Trading ActivitiesUnder established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading activities using a VAR approach that takes into account exposures resulting from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and commodity risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio against established limits. For risk management purposes, our VAR calculation measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. This means that, on average, trading losses are expected to exceed VAR one out of 100 trading days or two to three times per year. While VAR can be a useful risk management tool, it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance. As such, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk. Other tools used to actively manage trading risk include scenario analysis, stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits. In addition to VAR, in accordance with the new Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk Rule (the “Market Risk Rule”), which was effective January 1, 2013, we also calculate Stressed VAR, which is used as a component of the total market risk-based capital charge. We calculate the Stressed VAR risk measure using a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employ a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window that reflects a period of significant financial stress to our portfolio.113The following table presents VAR, Stressed VAR, and net trading assets for the three and six months ended June 30, as well as VAR by Risk Factor at June 30, 2013:Value at Risk Profile      Table 18         Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2013 2012VAR (1-day holding period)       Ending$5 $4 $5 $4High8 4 8 5Low3 3 3 3Average4 4 5 4        Stressed VAR (10-day holding period) 1       Ending$31 N/A $31 N/AHigh92 N/A 92 N/ALow25 N/A 12 N/AAverage35 N/A 29 N/A        Net Trading Assets (Dollars in billions)       Ending balance$4.6 $4.5 $4.6 $4.5Average balance4.8 4.6 4.8 4.7        (Dollars in millions)June 30, 2013       VAR by Risk Factor (1-day holding period) 1      Commodity price risk$—     Equity price risk4     Foreign exchange risk—     Interest rate risk3     Credit spread risk4     VAR (1-day diversified) total5     1 "N/A" - The calculation of Stressed VAR and VAR by Risk Factor under the new Market Risk Rule was not applicable in prior periods.The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VAR, is predominantly comprised of four material sub-portfolios of covered positions: Equity Derivatives, Fixed Income, Interest Rate Derivatives, and Credit Trading. There were no material changes in composition of the trading portfolio during the first six months of 2013. While VAR and Stressed VAR was higher during the six months ended June 30, 2013, driven by increased volume in our equity derivatives business, exposure to equity price risk factors were subsequently reduced resulting in a lower risk profile at June 30, 2013. The trading portfolio did not contain any correlation trading positions or on or off balance sheet securitization positions during the first six months of 2013.Effective January 1, 2013, a change to our VAR methodology was implemented and we began using historical based simulation instead of the previously used Monte Carlo simulation. At the time of methodology change implementation, our VAR calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation yielded results that were similar to the historical simulation presented. The methodology change was primarily to ensure our internal modeling approach for VAR was on the same basis as that for Stressed VAR, which is a requirement under the Market Risk Rule.In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, we evaluate the accuracy of our VAR model through daily backtesting by comparing daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) with the corresponding daily VAR-based measures. As illustrated below, for the first six months of 2013 there were no instances where trading losses exceeded firmwide VAR.114We have valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for all covered positions. Additionally, reporting of trading positions is in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to independent price verification. See Note 11, "Derivative Financial Instruments" and Note 13, "Fair Value Election and Measurement" in this Form 10-Q and "Critical Accounting Policies" in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies.Model risk management: Our model risk management approach for validating and evaluating the accuracy of internal models and modeling processes includes developmental and implementation testing and on-going monitoring and maintenance performed by the various model owners. Our MRMG performs an independent model review for the VAR and stressed VAR models. The model reviews include an evaluation of all the model-owner authored documentation and the model-owner performed monitoring and maintenance. In addition, the MRMG performs its own testing which may include independent results replication, model replication, challenger model development, sensitivity analysis, benchmarking against other models or available metrics, back testing, and outcomes analysis. Due to ongoing developments in financial markets and modeling technological developments, but also for purposes of model enhancement, we review the VAR models on an ongoing basis.Stress testing: We use a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VAR reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of rare and extreme historical but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. In addition to performing firmwide stress testing of our aggregate trading portfolio, additional types of secondary stress tests including historical repeats and simulations using hypothetical risk factor shocks are also performed. Across our comprehensive stress testing framework, all trading positions across each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and commodity risk) are included. We review stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and make updates as necessary to ensure that both current and potential emerging risks are appropriately captured.Trading portfolio capital adequacy:  We assess capital adequacy on a regular basis, based on estimates of our risk profile and capital positions under both baseline and stressed scenarios. Scenarios consider material risks, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Our assessment of capital adequacy arising from market risk also includes a review of risk arising from material portfolios of covered positions. See “Capital Resources” in this MD&A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. Liquidity Risk ManagementLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. 115For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments.The Bank’s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities (unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets) in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a store of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. At June 30, 2013, the Bank’s AFS investment portfolio contained $12.5 billion of unencumbered and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately 95% consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital service) for an extended period of months in accordance with our risk limits.We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades, severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingency liquidity. These sources of contingency liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Bank’s investment portfolio; the capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The following table presents period end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. We believe these contingency liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs.Contingency Liquidity Sources   Table 19 June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012(Dollars in billions)As of  Average for theSix Months Ended ¹  As of  Average for theSix Months Ended ¹ Excess reserves$— $1.6 $2.6 $1.9Free and liquid investment portfolio securities12.5 12.1 12.5 13.6FHLB borrowing capacity12.8 13.6 10.9 10.8Discount Window borrowing capacity19.4 18.9 17.3 17.1Total$44.7 $46.2 $43.3 $43.41Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.Uses of Funds. Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. At June 30, 2013, the Parent Company had no CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in its Federal Reserve account. The Parent Company also retains a material cash position, in accordance with our policies and risk limits, discussed in greater detail below.Contingent uses of funds may arise from a variety of adverse events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. At June 30, 2013, S&P maintained a "Positive" outlook and Moody’s, Fitch, and DBRS all maintained a “Stable” outlook on our credit ratings. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the "Positive" and “Stable” credit rating outlooks. 116Debt Credit Ratings and Outlook      Table 20 June 30, 2013 Moody’s  S&P  Fitch  DBRS SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits originated primarily from our retail branch network are our largest and most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits decreased to $125.6 billion at June 30, 2013, from $130.2 billion at December 31, 2012, driven primarily by a seasonal decline in deposits. The expiration of the FDIC's temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts on December 31, 2012 had an immaterial impact on our deposit balances.We also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding increased modestly to $15.9 billion at June 30, 2013 from $15.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits, as well as Fed funds purchased, decreased modestly from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2012 to $4.3 billion at June 30, 2013.As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of such securities, of which approximately $1.6 billion of issuance capacity remains available. During the first six months of 2013, we issued several small structured notes for the Parent Company in the aggregate amount of $36 million. The Bank maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. In April 2013, the Bank issued $600 million of 10-year senior notes that will pay a fixed annual coupon rate of 2.75%. We may call the notes at par beginning on April 1, 2023. At June 30, 2013, the Bank retained $36.9 billion of remaining capacity to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these Bank and Parent Company programs refers to authorization granted by our Board, or formal program capacity, and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector. Therefore, our ability to access these markets in the future could be impaired for either systemic or idiosyncratic reasons. As mentioned above, we maintain contingency funding scenarios to anticipate and manage the likely impact of impaired capital markets access and other adverse liquidity circumstances.Parent Company Liquidity. Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its cash resources. We measure and manage this metric "Months to Required Funding," using forecasts of both normal and adverse conditions. Under adverse conditions, we measure how long the Parent Company can meet its capital and debt service obligations after experiencing material attrition of short-term, unsecured funding and without the support of dividends from the Bank or access to the capital markets. At June 30, 2013, the Parent's Months to Required Funding remained well in excess of current ALCO and Board limits. Our Board Risk Committee regularly reviews this and other liquidity risk metrics. In accordance with these risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Company’s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. There is no Parent Company debt scheduled to mature in 2013. A majority of the Parent Company’s liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, loans to our subsidiaries, and common share repurchases. We may repurchase common stock subject to an annual capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in the CCAR process. Since the Federal Reserve did not object to 117our capital plan submitted in January 2013, during the first quarter we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock between the second quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014. Pursuant to that plan, we repurchased $50 million of our outstanding common stock during the second quarter. We used existing cash balances at the Parent Company to fund these repurchases. See further details of the authorized common share repurchases in the "Capital Resources" section of this MD&A and in Part II, "Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
