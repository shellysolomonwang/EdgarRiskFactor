Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2010; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2010.   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·   Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized gain (loss)”):            §   Sales or disposals of securities;            §   Impairments of securities;            §   Change in the fair value of derivative investments, embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and our trading securities;            §   Change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities, which is referred to as “GDB derivatives results”;            §   Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefit (“GLB”) riders within our variable annuities accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards CodificationTM (“ASC”) (“embedded derivative reserves”), net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative reserves, the net of which is referred to as “GLB net derivative results”; and            §   Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC (“indexed annuity forward-starting option”).        ·   Change in reserves accounted for under the Financial Services – Insurance – Claim Costs and Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits Subtopic of the FASB ASC resulting from benefit ratio unlocking on our GDB and GLB riders (“benefit ratio unlocking”);        ·   Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards;        ·   Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;        ·   Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt;        ·   Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and        ·   Income (loss) from discontinued operations.      Income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders is net income (loss) available to common stockholders (used in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share) in accordance with GAAP, excluding the after-tax effects of the items above and the acceleration of our Series B preferred stock discount as a result of redemption prior to five years from the date of issuance.   Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·   Excluded realized gain (loss);        ·   Amortization of deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) arising from changes in GDB and GLB benefit ratio unlocking;        ·   Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and        ·   Revenue adjustments from the initial adoption of new accounting standards.      Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 15. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the        58           operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.   We use our prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 35% while taking into account any permanent differences for events recognized differently in our financial statements and federal income tax returns when reconciling our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information.

       ·   Economic declines and credit market illiquidity could cause us to realize additional impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;        ·   Uncertainty about the impact of existing or new stimulus legislation on the economy;        ·   The restrictions, oversight, cost and other consequences of being a savings and loan holding company, including from the supervision, regulation and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”), and arising from our participation in the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s, or the “U.S. Treasury,” Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”) certain requirements of which may continue to apply to us so long as U.S. Treasury holds the warrant that we issued as a part of our participation in the CPP even after Lincoln’s repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the Treasury as part of the CPP;        ·   Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserves and/or risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements related to secondary guarantees under universal life and variable annuity products such as Actuarial Guideline 43 (“AG43,” also known as Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities or “VACARVM”); restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. Federal tax reform;        ·   The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and extra-contractual and class action damage cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;        ·   Changes in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction of investment income, the margins of our subsidiaries’ fixed annuity and life insurance businesses and demand for their products;        ·   A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and DFEL and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;        ·   Ineffectiveness of our various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;        ·   A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in elevated impairments on investments and amortization of intangible assets that may cause an increase in reserves and/or a reduction in assets, resulting in a corresponding decrease in net income;        ·   Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;        ·   Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse impact such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial condition;        ·     Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;            59               ·   Significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios requiring that we realize losses on such investments;        ·   The impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions;        ·   The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that we have purchased;        ·   Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;        ·   Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;        ·   The unknown impact on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and        ·   Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could impact our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.    INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and group protection.   We provide products and services in two operating businesses and report results through four business segments as follows:        Business   Corresponding Segments    Retirement Solutions   Annuities      Defined Contribution         Insurance Solutions   Life Insurance      Group Protection       These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2009 Form 10-K.   We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. Other Operations also includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments; benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re; our run-off Institutional Pension business; and debt costs.   Our former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K and Note 3 for more information.   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.          60           Current Market Conditions   Recent unfavorable market conditions including, but not limited to, the following concerns are weighing on the U.S. economy:       ·   High unemployment, shrinking unemployment benefits and weak job creation, all leading to lower disposable income that is necessary to fuel economic growth;        ·   Stressed capital and credit markets in Europe, and the impact of the expiration of the European Central Bank’s 12-month liquidity facility on July 1, 2010, that had provided liquidity to euro area banks following the global financial crisis, as many banks still cannot access the short-term commercial paper market;        ·   Reports of an economic slowdown in China as policymakers have taken steps to slow lending due to concerns that the rapid expansion of its real estate sector could constitute a price bubble;        ·   Slowing U.S. housing market despite historically low housing prices and mortgage rates that have sunk to levels not seen in more than a half-century believed to be due in part to the tightening of mortgage lending standards and the April 30, 2010, expiration of the federal tax credit;        ·   Declining equity markets; and        ·   Sinking consumer confidence.      For these reasons, concerns exist that the economy is at risk of slipping into a “double-dip” recession (i.e., a continuous recession that is punctuated by a period of growth and then followed by a further decline in the economy). The National Bureau of Economic Research (“NBER”), a panel of economists charged with officially designating business cycles, announced in April 2010 that it cannot yet declare an end to the recession that began in December 2007. The market conditions during this time were characterized by extreme volatility and disruption that affected both equity market returns and interest rates as credit spreads widened across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets, and some of these economic issues appear to be resurfacing as mentioned above, thereby making the timing of an upward turn in the economy harder to discern than in the past. An NBER committee stated that a determination of the “trough” date based on current data would be premature.   The markets have primarily impacted us in the following areas:   Capital   During the second quarter of 2010, we addressed two matters that we believe had been depressing our stock price: our participation in the CPP and the upcoming maturity of credit facilities in the first quarter of 2011 related to letters of credit (“LOCs”) supporting our life insurance business that could have remained outstanding until the first quarter of 2012. On June 30, 2010, after consultation with the OTS, we repurchased our Series B preferred stock that we had issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of our participation in the CPP, primarily as a result of the improvements in the economy and capital markets, as well as the strength of our business model and our capital position. We funded the $950 million liquidation value of the stock with net proceeds of approximately $368 million from a common stock offering, proceeds from a $250 million five-year senior notes offering and cash held at our holding company that was attributable primarily to proceeds from the sale of Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. (“Delaware”). As a result of repurchasing the preferred stock, we accelerated the remaining accretion of the preferred stock issuance discount of $131 million and recorded a corresponding charge to retained earnings and income (loss) available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per common share. Following the repayment, the U.S. Treasury continues to hold a warrant to purchase 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.92 per share. We notified the U.S. Treasury that we will not repurchase the warrant, which under the terms of the agreement between the parties acts as U.S. Treasury's notice to us of its intention to sell the warrant. In addition, we secured $2 billion of bank credit facilities as discussed in “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain,” “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” and Note 9. We also completed a 30-year senior notes offering of $500 million, the proceeds of which will be used as part of a long-term financing solution supporting UL business with secondary guarantees. For more information about our common stock and debt issuances, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” below.   During May and June of 2010, Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) and A.M. Best Co. (“A.M. Best”) all improved their outlook on our company to stable from negative, and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)outlook remained stable. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2009 Form 10-K and our Form 8-K filed on June 2, 2010.   Even with our actions, our improving ratings and our ability to produce solid results in our core businesses over the past several quarters, the price of our common stock remained volatile and declined to close at $24.29 on June 30, 2010, after trading at a high of $33.55 during the first six months of 2010. We believe the recent volatility and decline in our stock price is more a result of the current macro economic conditions discussed above that are impacting our peer group and the entire market as opposed to factors that are unique to our company.        61             In the face of these global economic challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses. However, the prior significant decline in the equity markets continues to constrain growth of average account values despite higher deposits and net flows during the first six months of 2010 than in the comparable period of 2009.   Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business   Because the profitability of our fixed annuity, UL, VUL and defined contribution insurance business depends in part on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability. Changes in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital. Some of our products, principally our fixed annuities, UL and VUL, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates or prolonged low interest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts. Although we have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment, declines in our spread, or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products, could have an adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations. We discuss the earnings impact of interest rates below in “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” and “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.”   Earnings from Account Values   Our asset-gathering segments – Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution – are the most sensitive to the equity markets, as well as, to a lesser extent, our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values and the related asset-based earnings below in “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2009, to June 30, 2010, our account values were down $996 million driven primarily by a significant decline in equity markets during the month of June, partially offset by strong deposits and positive net flows. While the end of period S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) as of June 30, 2010, was lower than as of December 31, 2009, the daily average S&P 500 increased 1% during this time.   Investment Income on Alternative Investments   Our alternative investments portfolio consists primarily of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our investment portfolio.   Variable Annuity Hedge Program Results   We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the GLB embedded derivatives in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in embedded derivative reserves. These results are excluded from the Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Defined Contribution segments’ operating revenues and income from operations. See “Realized Gain (Loss) – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” for information on our methodology for calculating the non-performance risk (“NPR”), which affects the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve.   We also offer variable products with death benefit guarantees. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we use derivative instruments to attempt to hedge the income statement impact in the opposite direction of the GDB benefit ratio unlocking for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations.   Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses   Related to our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net realized losses that reduced net income by $14 million and $18 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, and included credit-related write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of $7 million and $42 million, respectively. Although economic conditions have improved, we expect a continuation of some level of OTTI. If we were to experience another period of weakness in the economic environment like we did in late 2008 and early 2009, it could lead to increased credit defaults, resulting in additional write-downs of securities for OTTI.        62             Increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit fundamentals (i.e., market improvement and narrowing credit spreads) as of June 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, have resulted in the $1.0 billion decrease in gross unrealized losses on the available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity securities in our general account as of June 30, 2010.   Issues and Outlook   For the remainder of 2010, significant issues include:       ·   Potential unstable credit markets that can impact our financing alternatives, spreads and other-than-temporary securities impairments;        ·   Potential volatile equity markets that have a significant impact on our hedge program performance and revenues;        ·   Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which affects the investment margins and reserve levels for many of our products, such as fixed annuities, UL and the fixed portion of defined contribution and VUL business;        ·   Continuation of global economic challenges;        ·   Achieving continued sales success with our portfolio of products, including marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features, as well as retaining management and wholesaler talent to maintain our competitive position;        ·   Evolving treatment of reserve financing by rating agencies; and        ·   Continuing focus by the government on tax, financial and healthcare reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) calculations, which may affect the value and profitability of our products and overall earnings.      In the face of these issues and potential issues, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2010:       ·   Continuing to explore additional financing strategies addressing the statutory reserve strain related to our secondary guarantee UL products in order to manage our capital position effectively in accordance with our pricing guidelines;        ·   Increasing our product development activities together with identifying future product development initiatives, with a focus on further reducing risk related to guaranteed benefit riders available with certain variable annuity contracts;        ·   Evaluating opportunities for strategic investments in our businesses to grow revenues and further spur productivity, particularly in Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution and Insurance Solutions – Group Protection, with technology upgrades and new products for the voluntary market and an expanded distribution focus for our group business;        ·   Managing our expenses aggressively through process improvement initiatives combined with continued financial discipline and execution excellence throughout our operations;        ·   Closely monitoring ongoing changes in the legal and regulatory environment; and        ·   Closely monitoring our capital and liquidity positions taking into account the fragile economic recovery and changing statutory accounting and reserving practices.      For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.          63           Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2009 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2009 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2009 Form 10-K.   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   Our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL balances (in millions) by business segment as of June 30, 2010, were as follows:           Retirement Solutions       Insurance Solutions                      Defined       Life       Group                Annuities       Contribution       Insurance       Protection       Total      DAC and VOBA                                  Gross    $ 2,668     $ 514     $ 6,582     $ 166     $ 9,930     Unrealized (gain) loss      (512 )     (139 )     (744 )     -       (1,395 )   Carrying value    $ 2,156     $ 375     $ 5,838     $ 166     $ 8,535                                                DSI                                            Gross    $ 331     $ 2     $ -     $ -     $ 333     Unrealized (gain) loss      (44 )     -       -       -       (44 )   Carrying value    $ 287     $ 2     $ -     $ -     $ 289                                                DFEL                                            Gross    $ 205     $ -     $ 1,292     $ -     $ 1,497     Unrealized gain (loss)      (4 )     -       (185 )     -       (189 )   Carrying value    $ 201     $ -     $ 1,107     $ -     $ 1,308       AFS securities and certain derivatives are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of associated DAC, VOBA, DSI, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. The unrealized balances in the table above represent the DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL balances for these effects of unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities and certain derivatives as of the end-of-period.   On a quarterly basis, we may record an adjustment to the amounts included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or expense for the impact of the difference between future expected gross profits (“EGPs”) used in the prior quarter and the emergence of actual and updated future EGPs in the current quarter (“retrospective unlocking”). In addition, in the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and the projection models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. These assumptions include investment margins, mortality, retention, rider utilization and maintenance expenses (costs associated with maintaining records relating to insurance and individual and group annuity contracts and with the processing of premium collections, deposits, withdrawals and commissions). Based on our review, the cumulative balances of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are adjusted with an offsetting benefit or charge to revenue or amortization expense to reflect such change (“prospective unlocking – assumption changes”). We may have prospective unlocking in other quarters as we become aware of information that warrants updating outside of our annual comprehensive review. We may also identify and implement actuarial modeling refinements (“prospective unlocking – model refinements”) that result in increases or decreases to the carrying values of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. The primary distinction between retrospective and prospective unlocking is that retrospective unlocking is driven by the difference between actual gross profits compared to EGPs each period, while prospective unlocking is driven by changes in assumptions or projection models related to our projections of future EGPs.   In discussing our results of operations below in this MD&A, we refer to favorable and unfavorable unlocking. With respect to DAC, VOBA and DSI, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization expense in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization expense in the period. With respect to DFEL, favorable unlocking refers to an increase in the amortization income in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to a decrease in the amortization income in the period. With respect to the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees, favorable unlocking refers to a decrease in reserves in the period, whereas unfavorable unlocking refers to an increase in reserves in the period.        64             We amortize DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL in proportion to our EGPs. When actual gross profits are higher in the period than expected, we recognize more amortization than planned. When actual gross profits are lower in the period than expected, we recognize less amortization than planned. In a calendar year where the gross profits for a certain group of policies, or “cohorts,” are expected to be negative, our actuarial process limits, or floors, the amortization expense offset to zero.   During the first quarter of 2010, there was a $21 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA from assumption changes due to including an estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2010, we revised this estimate, which resulted in an additional $5 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA.   Because equity market movements have a significant impact on the value of variable annuity and VUL products and the fees earned on these accounts, EGPs could increase or decrease with movements in the equity markets; therefore, significant and sustained changes in equity markets have had and could in the future have an impact on DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) business and VUL business.   As equity markets do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our “reversion to the mean” (“RTM”) process. Under our RTM process, on each valuation date, future EGPs are projected using stochastic modeling of a large number of future equity market scenarios in conjunction with best estimates of lapse rates, interest rate spreads and mortality to develop a statistical distribution of the present value of future EGPs for our variable annuity, annuity-based 401(k) and VUL blocks of business. Because future equity market returns are unpredictable, the underlying premise of this process is that best estimate projections of future EGPs need not be affected by random short-term and insignificant deviations from expectations in equity market returns. However, long-term or significant deviations from expected equity market returns require a change to best estimate projections of EGPs and prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits. The statistical distribution is designed to identify when the equity market return deviations from expected returns have become significant enough to warrant a change of the future equity return EGP assumption.   The stochastic modeling performed for our variable annuity blocks of business as described above is used to develop a range of reasonably possible future EGPs. We compare the range of the present value of the future EGPs from the stochastic modeling to that used in our amortization model. A set of intervals around the mean of these scenarios is utilized to calculate two separate statistical ranges of reasonably possible EGPs. These intervals are then compared again to the present value of the EGPs used in the amortization model. If the present value of EGP assumptions utilized for amortization were to exceed the margin of the reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision of the EGPs used to calculate amortization would occur. If a revision is deemed necessary, future EGPs would be re-projected using the current account values at the end of the period during which the revision occurred along with a revised long-term annual equity market gross return assumption such that the re-projected EGPs would be our best estimate of EGPs.   Notwithstanding these intervals, if a severe decline or advance in equity markets were to occur or should other circumstances, including contract holder behavior, suggest that the present value of future EGPs no longer represents our best estimate, we could determine that a revision of the EGPs is necessary.   Our practice is not necessarily to unlock immediately after exceeding the first of the two statistical ranges, but, rather, if we stay between the first and second statistical range for several quarters, we would likely unlock. Additionally, if we exceed the ranges as a result of a short-term market reaction, we would not necessarily unlock. However, if the second statistical range is exceeded for more than one quarter, it is likely that we would unlock. While this approach reduces adjustments to DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL due to short-term equity market fluctuations, significant changes in the equity markets that extend beyond one or two quarters could result in a significant favorable or unfavorable unlocking.   Our long-term equity market growth assumption rate is 9%, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, as this component is related primarily to underlying investments in equity funds within the separate accounts. This variable appreciation rate is before the deduction of our contract fees. Although the piercing of the outer corridor does not automatically result in a resetting of our RTM assumption, if economic conditions change significantly, additional unlocking of our RTM assumptions could be possible in future periods. However, if we were to have unlocked our RTM assumption in the corridor as of June 30, 2010, for our Retirement Solutions business, we would have recorded a favorable prospective unlocking of approximately $150 million, pre-tax, as a result of improved market conditions since our last unlock of RTM in the fourth quarter of 2008.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment tests conducted at least annually. Intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We are required to perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill. In Step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit is        65           determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value of the reporting unit is deemed to be recoverable, and Step 2 is not required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist, and Step 2 is required. In Step 2, the reporting unit’s goodwill implied fair value is determined. The reporting unit’s fair value as determined in Step 1 is assigned to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment test. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its fair value. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements within our 2009 Form 10-K for goodwill and intangible assets by reporting unit.    The fair values of our insurance and annuities businesses are comprised of two components: the value of new business and the value of in-force business. Factors could cause us to believe our estimated fair value of the total business may be lower than the carrying value and trigger a Step 1 test, but may not require a step 2 test, and even if it does, not result in a goodwill impairment under the Step 2 test because the Step 2 test is focused on supporting the fair value of the goodwill asset. The value of new business supports the valuation of our goodwill asset. Our Life Insurance reporting unit’s implied fair value of goodwill is most sensitive to new business production levels and discount rates. Factors that could impact production levels include mix of new business, customer acceptance of our products and distribution strength. Recent declines in interest rates have applied downward pressure to the interest rate inputs used in the discount rate calculation. Spread compression and other impacts to profitability caused by lower interest rates have a much more significant impact on the valuation of in-force business than the valuation of new business. The impact of interest rate movements on the value of new business is primarily related to the discount rate, because the cash flows for new business are not as sensitive to interest rates as our in-force business.    While threats to future profitability can theoretically cause an increase to the discount rate, a drop in the risk-free interest rates will also lower the cost of capital used in calculating the discount rate applied to the business. Our sensitivity disclosures for the effect that changes in valuation assumptions could have on our estimate of our reporting units’ fair value, therefore, provide sensitivities to both discount rates and new business generation and do not isolate interest rates. For such disclosures, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   As discussed above in “Current Market Conditions – Stock Price,” our stock price has been unfavorably affected by the current market conditions. At this time, we believe the decline in our stock price neither corresponds to a decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units nor provides an indicator that requires us to perform an interim impairment test to reassess our conclusions related to goodwill recoverability since our annual evaluation as of October 1, 2009, due primarily to the following:        ·   The price of our common stock as of June 30, 2010, was slightly higher than its price as of October 1, 2009, and although our volatility has increased it recently, it has not occurred for a prolonged period of time;        ·   Lower debt yields have applied downward pressure to the discount rate calculation;        ·   During the second quarter of 2010, we repurchased our Series B preferred stock that we had issued through the CPP and secured $2 billion of bank credit facilities as well as completed a senior notes offering of $500 million, the proceeds of which will be used as part of a long-term financing solution supporting UL business with secondary guarantees; each of these matters had previously been weighing on the estimated fair value of our reporting units;         ·   We have experienced improving ratings since October 1, 2009;        ·   We have produced solid results in our core businesses over the past several quarters, and our earnings projections and expectations for future sales have not deteriorated since our annual evaluation;        ·   We have not experienced higher impairments on invested assets than assumed in our projections; and        ·   The key assumptions used in our estimates of fair value have not significantly changed from October 1, 2009.      We will continue to monitor the current market conditions, and if they were to deteriorate to levels experienced during the end of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, and, in particular, if our share price were to remain below book value per share for an extended period of time or deteriorate further, we may need to perform interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to our annual test as of October 1, 2010.   Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities   We have investments in two credit-linked notes (“CLNs”) that are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Effective January 1, 2010, in accordance with new accounting guidance (see Note 2), we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As such, we reflected the financial condition and results of operations of these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $169 million, after-tax, to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2010.    We use assumptions, estimates and judgments similar to those used for our investments and derivatives in determining the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs. In addition, we use judgments in concluding whether we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. Specifically, judgment is required in situations where our economic interest in the VIE is significantly greater than our stated power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE.   See Note 4 for more detail regarding the consolidation of these VIEs.          66               Investments   Investment Valuation   As of June 30, 2010, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we generally do not obtain multiple prices for our financial instruments. We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes as we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs that they use to determine the prices in contrast to the broker quotes where we have limited information on the pricing inputs. As of June 30, 2010, we only obtained multiple prices for 36 available-for-sale and trading securities. These multiple prices were primarily related to instances where the vendor was providing a price for the first time and we also received a broker quote. In these instances, we used the price from the pricing service due to the higher reliability as discussed above. As of June 30, 2010, we used broker quotes for 173 securities as our final price source, representing less than 4% of total securities owned.   Derivatives   We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of June 30, 2010, contain industry standard terms. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits   As of June 30, 2010, the fair values of the embedded derivative reserves, before adjustment for the required NPR factors, for the guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature, the i4LIFE® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) feature and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB feature were $1.1 billion, $427 million and $286 million, respectively. See “Realized Gain (Loss) – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” for information on how we determine our NPR.   As of June 30, 2010, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was $2.2 billion. As of June 30, 2010, the sum of all GLB liabilities at fair value, excluding the NPR adjustment, and GDB reserves was $1.9 billion, comprised of $1.8 billion for GLB liabilities and $105 million for the GDB reserves. The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the liabilities by $265 million. However, the relationship of hedge assets to the liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging strategy.   Approximately 42% of our variable annuity account values contain a GWB rider as of June 30, 2010. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of June 30, 2010, and June 30, 2009, 83% and 75% respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of June 30, 2010, and June 30, 2009, was $3.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. The ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GWB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $3.1 billion, net of reinsurance.   For information on our GLB and GDB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss)” below.          67           The following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous impact to realized gain (loss), which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities (in millions) at the levels indicated in the table and excludes the net cost of operating the hedging program. The amounts represent the estimated difference between the change in the portion of GLB reserves that is calculated on a fair value basis and the change in the value of the underlying hedge instruments after the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and taxes. These impacts do not include any estimate of retrospective or prospective unlocking that could occur, nor do they estimate any change in the NPR component of the GLB reserve or any estimate of impacts to our GLB benefit ratio unlocking. These estimates are based upon the recorded reserves as of June 30, 2010, and the related hedge instruments in place as of that date. The effects presented in the table below are not representative of the aggregate impacts that could result if a combination of such changes to equity market returns, interest rates and implied volatilities occurred.

Tracking or basis risk in the second quarter of 2010 increased earnings by $4 million.      Acquisitions and Dispositions   For information about acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 in this report and “Part I – Item 1. Business – Acquisitions and Dispositions,” “Part II – Item 7.

Net income increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Loss from discontinued operations of $154 million during the second quarter of 2009 driven primarily by the loss on disposition of our Lincoln UK segment partially offset by income from discontinued operations related to our former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments (see Note 3 for more information on our discontinued operations).        ·   Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows, partially offset by transfers from fixed to variable since the second quarter of 2009;            §   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Additional Information” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” and “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information);            §   Higher invested assets driven primarily by favorable net flows on fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, and to a lesser extent issuances of common stock and debt subsequent to June 30, 2009; and            §   Actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates and holding lower cash balances in the second quarter of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields;        ·   A decrease in realized losses on our AFS securities attributable primarily to lower OTTI due to overall improvement in the credit markets;        ·   Higher earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund (within our Defined Contribution segment) products as a result of increases in the equity markets;        ·   The overall unfavorable GDB derivative results, excluding unlocking, during the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to sporadic large movements in rates and equities that caused non-linear changes in the liability relative to the derivatives utilized in the hedge program and by other items (see “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information on our GDB derivatives results);        ·   The overall unfavorable GLB net derivatives results, excluding unlocking, during the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to increases in interest rates and our over-hedged position for a period of time in 2009 (see “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information on our GLB liability and derivative performance); and        ·     A $5 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA during the second quarter of 2010 from assumption changes due to revising the estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees.             71            The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:       ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings, partially offset by favorable separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items that impacted the effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2010;        ·   Higher benefits due primarily to an increase in the change in GDB reserves from an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the decrease in account values due to unfavorable equity markets, unfavorable claims incidence and termination experience in the long-term disability product line of our Group Protection segment and less favorable mortality in our Life Insurance segment;        ·   A $21 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees during the second quarter of 2010 compared to a $31 million favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2009:            §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2010 was due primarily to the increase in the change in GDB reserves as a result of the impact of unfavorable equity markets on our variable account values partially offset by higher equity market performance, higher expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed; and            §   The favorable retrospective unlocking during second quarter of 2009 was due primarily to the decrease in the change in GDB reserves as a result of variable account growth;        §   Higher DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due primarily to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs being applied to the higher actual gross profits in the second quarter of 2010, discussed below in “Retirement Solutions – Annuities – Additional Information”;        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows and the impact of favorable equity markets on account values;            §   Investments in strategic initiatives in the second quarter of 2010; and            §   Higher interest and debt expenses as a result of an increase in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and higher average balances of outstanding debt in 2010; partially offset by            §   Restructuring charges related to expense reduction initiatives in the second quarter of 2009, and lower expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the corresponding period in 2009; and        §   The unfavorable realized loss related to certain derivative instruments and trading securities during the second quarter of 2010 attributable primarily to spreads widening on corporate credit default swaps, which affected the derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs, partially offset by gains on our trading securities due to the decline in interest rates.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Net income increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Impairment of goodwill in the first quarter of 2009 of $600 million for Retirement Solutions – Annuities due to continued market volatility, the corresponding increase in discount rates and lower annuity sales (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information on our goodwill impairment); however, this non-cash impairment did not impact our liquidity;        ·   Income from discontinued operations of $31 million during the first six months of 2010 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $146 million during the first six months of 2009 related to our former Lincoln UK and Investment Management segments (see Note 3 for more information on our discontinued operations);        ·   Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited, excluding unlocking and the impact of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement in the first quarter of 2009 mentioned below, driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows, partially offset by transfers from fixed to variable since the second quarter of 2009;            §   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Additional Information” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” and “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information);            §   Higher invested assets driven primarily by favorable net flows on fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, and to a lesser extent issuances of common stock and debt subsequent to June 30, 2009; and            §   Actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates and holding lower cash balances in the first six months of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields;        ·   Higher earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund (within our Defined Contribution segment) products as a result of increases in the equity markets;        ·     A decrease in realized losses on our AFS securities attributable primarily to lower OTTI due to overall improvement in the credit markets;            72               ·   A $5 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees during the first six months of 2010 compared to a $103 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2009:            §   The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity market performance, higher expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed partially offset by the increase in the change in GDB reserves as a result of the impact of unfavorable equity markets on our variable account values; and            §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2009 was due primarily to the overall performance of our GLB derivative program (see “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information on our GLB derivative performance) and the impact of lower equity market performance and higher lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by the favorable change in the fair value of GDB derivatives;        ·   The overall unfavorable GLB net derivatives results, excluding unlocking, during the first six months of 2009 due primarily to increases in interest rates and our over-hedged position for a period of time in 2009 (see “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information on our GLB liability and derivative performance);        ·   The $64 million unfavorable impact from the rescission in the first quarter of 2009 of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re, as discussed in “Results of Other Operations” below;        ·   The overall unfavorable GDB derivative results, excluding unlocking, during the first six months of 2009 due primarily to sporadic large movements in rates and equities that caused non-linear changes in the liability relative to the derivatives utilized in the hedge program and by other items (see “Realized Gain (Loss)” below for more information on our GDB derivatives results); and        ·   A $26 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA during the first six months of 2010 from assumption changes due to including an estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees.           The increase in net income was partially offset by the following:       ·   Higher DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, due primarily to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs being applied to the higher actual gross profits in the first six months of 2010, discussed below in “Retirement Solutions – Annuities – Additional Information”;        ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009 driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items;        ·   Higher benefits, excluding the impact of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement in the first quarter of 2009 mentioned above, due primarily to an increase in the change in GDB reserves from an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the decrease in account values due to unfavorable equity markets, adverse mortality in our Life Insurance and Group Protection segments and unfavorable claims incidence and termination experience in the long-term disability product line of our Group Protection segment;        ·   A $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 associated with the early extinguishment of long-term debt;        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows and the impact of favorable equity markets on account values;            §   Investments in strategic initiatives during the first six months of 2010; and            §   Higher interest and debt expenses as a result of an increase in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and higher average balances of outstanding debt in 2010; partially offset by            §   Restructuring charges related to expense reduction initiatives in the first six months of 2009, and lower expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans in the first six months of 2010 as compared to the corresponding period in 2009; and        ·   The unfavorable realized loss related to certain derivative instruments and trading securities during the first six months of 2010 attributable primarily to spreads widening on corporate credit default swaps, which affected the derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs, partially offset by gains on our trading securities due to the decline in interest rates.      The foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by segment discussions and “Realized Gain (Loss)” below. In addition, for a discussion of the earnings impact of the equity markets, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”            73           RESULTS OF RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS   The Retirement Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Defined Contribution. The Retirement Solutions – Annuities segment provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 marketplaces.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets;        ·   Higher net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows;            §   More favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Additional Information”, “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” and “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information); and            §   Holding lower cash balances in the second quarter of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields (see discussion in “Additional Information” below);               74                  ·    A $21 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, compared to a $5 million favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2009:                  §   The favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity market performance, higher expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed;            §   The higher amortization during the second quarter of 2010 was due primarily to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs for this segment being applied to the higher actual gross profits in the second quarter of 2010 (discussed in “Additional Information” below), discussed below; and            §   The favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2009 was due primarily to lower lapses and the impact of higher equity market performance than our model projections assumed;        ·   A $5 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA during the second quarter of 2010 from assumption changes due to revising the estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees; and        ·   Lower benefits from a decrease in the change in GDB reserves due to a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by the effect of favorable equity markets on account values and positive net flows; and            §   An increase in the allocation of overhead costs to this segment, discussed in “Additional Information” below; and        ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets;        ·   A $44 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the first six months of 2010, partially offset by higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, compared to a $2 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2009:            §   The favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to higher equity market performance, higher expense assessments and lower lapses than our model projections assumed;            §   The higher amortization during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs for this segment being applied to the higher actual gross profits (discussed in “Additional Information” below), discussed below; and            §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2009 was due primarily to higher lapses, higher death benefit costs and the impact of lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed;        ·   A $26 million favorable prospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA during the first six months of 2010 from assumption changes due to including an estimate in our models for rider fees related to our annuity products with living benefit guarantees;        ·   Higher net investment income, partially offset by higher interest credited, excluding unlocking, driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to positive net flows;            §   More favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Additional Information”, “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” and “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information); and            §   Holding lower cash balances during the first six months of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields (see discussion in “Additional Information” below); and        ·   Lower benefits from a decrease in the change in GDB reserves due to a decrease in our expected GDB benefit payments attributable primarily to the increase in account values above guaranteed levels due to the more favorable equity markets.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009 driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items; and        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due primarily to:            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by positive net flows; and            §   An increase in the allocation of overhead costs to this segment, discussed in “Additional Information” below.             75           Additional Information   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform. This conversion will harmonize methods and processes and involves an upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis capabilities. As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing assumptions and methods of calculations that exist between similar blocks of business within our actuarial models. This exercise may result in material one-time gain and loss adjustments to our results of operations and may result in changes to earnings trends. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations from any differences that may exist upon completion of the conversion. We expect to substantially complete the most critical phases of the conversion by the end of 2010. In the third quarter of each year, we also conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2009 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our prospective unlocking process.   Prior to the second quarter of 2009, the equity markets unfavorably impacted our average variable account values and the resulting fees earned on these accounts. Additionally, weaker credit fundamentals negatively impacted our investment margins and increased our realized losses on investments, including OTTI. As a result, we recorded prospective unlocking during the fourth quarter of 2008 related to our RTM process, as discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2009 Form 10-K. This RTM unlocking that occurred at an equity market trough had the impact of lowering the projected EGPs for this segment, thereby increasing our rate of amortization, results in higher DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and lower earnings for this segment.   Fixed annuity deposits moderated in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first six months of 2010, as customers shifted deposits back into variable annuity products as equity markets improved, and we expect this trend will continue during the remainder of 2010 with improving economic conditions.   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first six months of 2010, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in higher expenses.   During the volatile markets experienced in late 2008 and early 2009, we implemented a short-term liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances that reduced our portfolio yields by 33 basis points and 37 basis points during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively. As we progressed through 2009, we reduced these excess cash balances, thereby increasing our portfolio yields; therefore, there was no impact to our portfolio yields for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first six months of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period in 2009, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to 8% and 9% for the corresponding periods in 2009.   See Note 8 for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” and “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.”          76           We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Gain (Loss) – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” below for discussion of these attributed fees.          78           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                        estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 245     $ 235       4 %   $ 493     $ 458       8 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                     bond makewhole premiums (1)      4       -      NM        5       1      NM      Alternative investments (2)      -       -      NM        -       (1 )     100 %   Surplus investments (3)      23       9       156 %     44       26       69 %   Total net investment income    $ 272     $ 244       11 %   $ 542     $ 484       12 %                                                      Interest Credited                                                    Amount provided to contract holders    $ 183     $ 178       3 %   $ 365     $ 352       4 %   DSI deferrals      (18 )     (19 )     5 %     (37 )     (34 )     -9 %   Interest credited before DSI amortization      165       159       4 %     328       318       3 %   DSI amortization:                                                    Retrospective unlocking      (2 )     -      NM        (4 )     2      NM      Amortization, excluding unlocking      14       11       27 %     29       14       107 %   Total interest credited    $ 177     $ 170       4 %   $ 353     $ 334       6 %         (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit ratio unlocking.          80           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                                        Other Expenses                                        Commissions    $ 177     $ 157       13 %   $ 327     $ 282       16 %   General and administrative expenses      82       76       8 %     160       148       8 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      5       6       -17 %     13       10       30 %   Total expenses incurred, excluding                                                    broker-dealer      264       239       10 %     500       440       14 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals      (164 )     (158 )     -4 %     (296 )     (286 )     -3 %   Total pre-broker-dealer expenses incurred,                                                    excluding amortization, net of interest      100       81       23 %     204       154       32 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                                                    Prospective unlocking - assumption changes      (8 )     -      NM        (39 )     -      NM      Retrospective unlocking      (20 )     (5 )    NM        (47 )     13      NM      Amortization, net of interest, excluding                                                    unlocking      132       93       42 %     270       155       74 %   Broker-dealer expenses incurred      78       70       11 %     154       136       13 %   Total underwriting, acquisition,                                                    insurance and other expenses    $ 282     $ 239       18 %   $ 542     $ 458       18 %                                                      DAC and VOBA Deferrals                                                    As a percentage of sales/deposits      5.8 %     6.0 %             5.8 %     5.9 %             Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. These non-deferred commissions, which include trail commissions that are based upon account values, were approximately $50 million and $103 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to approximately $39 million and $71 million for the corresponding periods in 2009.   Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.   The increase in amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking, when comparing the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, to the corresponding periods in 2009, was due to a higher amortization rate from the reduction of projected EGPs for this segment being applied to the higher actual gross profits during the first six months of 2010 (discussed above in “Additional Information”).   During 2009, we had more unfavorable hedge program performance and securities impairments than our model projections assumed, which resulted in negative gross profits in total for certain cohorts. As a result, the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL for those cohorts during 2010 was significantly higher than it was in the previous year.            81           Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Operating Revenues                                        Insurance fees    $ 49     $ 45       9 %   $ 100     $ 85       18 %   Net investment income      191       176       9 %     377       351       7 %   Other revenues and fees      5       3       67 %     9       5       80 %   Total operating revenues      245       224       9 %     486       441       10 %   Operating Expenses                                                    Interest credited      110       112       -2 %     220       223       -1 %   Benefits      -       (1 )     100 %     2       (3 )     167 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                                                    expenses      85       74       15 %     164       147       12 %   Total operating expenses      195       185       5 %     386       367       5 %   Income from operations before taxes      50       39       28 %     100       74       35 %   Federal income tax expense      14       11       27 %     28       17       65 %   Income from operations    $ 36     $ 28       29 %   $ 72     $ 57       26 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to transfers from variable to fixed since the second quarter of 2009;            §   Crediting rate actions implemented after the second quarter of 2009 that reduced interest crediting rates;            §   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments due to the improvement in the capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information); and            §   Holding lower cash balances in the second quarter of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields (see discussion in “Additional Information” below); and        ·   Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets, partially offset by an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to investments in strategic initiatives in the second quarter of 2010, as discussed in “Additional Information” below; and        ·   A $2 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our guarantee riders in the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to higher lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by more favorable equity markets than our model projections assumed.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·   Higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited driven primarily by:            §   Higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, attributable primarily to transfers from variable to fixed since the second quarter of 2009;            §   Crediting rate actions implemented after the second quarter of 2009 that reduced interest crediting rates;            §   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments due to the improvement in the capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information); and                    §   Holding lower cash balances during the first six months of 2010 that increased our portfolio yields (see discussion in “Additional Information” below); and          82                ·   Higher insurance fees driven primarily by higher average daily variable account values due to more favorable equity markets, partially offset by an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to an increase in earnings and favorable tax return true-ups during the first quarter of 2009 attributable to the separate account DRD and other items; and        ·   Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to:            §   Investments in strategic initiatives during the first six months of 2010, as discussed in “Additional Information” below;            §   Higher account value-based trail commissions driven by the effect of favorable equity markets on account values; and            §   Higher DAC and VOBA amortization during the first six months of 2010, net of interest, due to higher actual gross profits attributable primarily to favorable equity markets; and        ·   A $3 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI and reserves for our guarantee riders in the first six months of 2010 due primarily to higher lapses than our model projections assumed, partially offset by more favorable equity markets than our model projections assumed, compared to a $1 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking in the first six months of 2009 due primarily to less favorable equity markets than our model projections assumed.      Additional Information   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform. This conversion will harmonize methods and processes and involves an upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis capabilities. As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing assumptions and methods of calculations that exist between similar blocks of business within our actuarial models. This exercise may result in material one-time gain and loss adjustments to our results of operations and may result in changes to earnings trends. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations from any differences that may exist upon completion of the conversion. We expect to substantially complete the most critical phases of the conversion by the end of 2010. In the third quarter of each year, we also conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2009 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our prospective unlocking process.   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first six months of 2010, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we expect to continue making strategic investments during 2010 to improve our infrastructure and product offerings that will also result in higher expenses.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first six months of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period in 2009, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   During the volatile markets experienced in late 2008 and early 2009, we implemented a short term liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances that reduced our portfolio yields by 18 basis points and 17 basis points during the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively. As we progressed through 2009, we reduced these cash balances, thereby increasing our portfolio yields; therefore, there was no impact to our portfolio yields for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 11% and 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to 11% for the corresponding periods in 2009. Our lapse rate is negatively impacted by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Total Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 43% and 47% as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.        83             See Note 8 for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features for our Retirement Solutions business.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” and “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.”   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.   When comparing the six months ended June 30, 2010, to the corresponding period in 2009, our net flows declined due to higher withdrawals during 2010, which is in line with higher account values and relatively flat lapse rates.          86           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                        estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 176     $ 172       2 %   $ 349     $ 336       4 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                    bond makewhole premiums (1)      1       -      NM        2       -      NM      Alternative investments (2)      1       (1 )     200 %     1       (1 )     200 %   Surplus investments (3)      13       5       160 %     25       16       56 %   Total net investment income    $ 191     $ 176       9 %   $ 377     $ 351       7 %                                                      Interest Credited    $ 110     $ 112       -2 %   $ 220     $ 223       -1 %         (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in GDB and GLB benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our GDB benefit ratio unlocking.          88           Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses   Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and                                        Other Expenses                                        Commissions    $ 16     $ 16       0 %   $ 32     $ 30       7 %   General and administrative expenses      58       54       7 %     111       107       4 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      3       3       0 %     7       7       0 %   Total expenses incurred      77       73       5 %     150       144       4 %   DAC deferrals      (15 )     (17 )     12 %     (31 )     (35 )     11 %   Total expenses recognized before                                                    amortization      62       56       11 %     119       109       9 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                                                    Retrospective unlocking      4       -      NM        5       2       150 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                                                    unlocking      19       18       6 %     40       36       11 %   Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance                                                    and other expenses    $ 85     $ 74       15 %   $ 164     $ 147       12 %                                                      DAC Deferrals                                                    As a percentage of annuity sales/deposits      2.2 %     2.4 %             2.1 %     2.3 %             Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the sale of annuity contracts are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. These non-deferred commissions, which include trail commissions that are based upon account values, were approximately $9 million and $19 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to approximately $9 million and $15 million for the corresponding periods in 2009. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are expensed as incurred.              89           RESULTS OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS   The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products. The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by:       ·   An increase in benefits attributable primarily to:            §   Higher death claims; and            §   An increase in traditional product reserves due to the harmonization of actuarial methods; partially offset by            §   A decrease in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves – reinsurance due to more favorable mortality;               90                ·   An increase in DAC, VOBA, and DFEL amortization, excluding unlocking, partially offset by a $5 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, and DFEL during the second quarter of 2010 compared to a $5 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2009:            §   The higher amortization during the second quarter of 2010 was due primarily to higher actual gross profits attributable primarily to higher investment income on alternative investments;            §   The favorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2010 was due primarily to higher actual gross profits compared to model assumptions; and            §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the second quarter of 2009 was due primarily to lower investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums than our model projections assumed, partially offset by lower death claims than our model projections assumed; and        ·   The inter-company reinsurance arrangement effective December 31, 2009, discussed below, which resulted in reductions in net investment income and an increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to higher net investment income and relatively flat interest credited attributable primarily to:       ·   More favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments and higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Additional Information” and “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” and “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information);        ·   Growth in business in force; and        ·   Actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates, discussed in “Additional Information” below.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by:       ·   An increase in benefits attributable primarily to:            §   Higher death claims; and            §   An increase in traditional product reserves due to the harmonization of certain processes; partially offset by            §   A decrease in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves – reinsurance due to more favorable mortality;        ·   An increase in DAC, VOBA, and DFEL amortization, excluding unlocking, partially offset by a $2 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, and DFEL during the first six months of 2010, compared to a $14 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2009:            §   The higher amortization during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to higher actual gross profits attributable primarily to higher investment income on alternative investments;            §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2010 was due primarily to lower persistency and lower investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums than our model projections assumed, partially offset by lower lapse rates than our model projections assumed; and            §   The unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2009 was due primarily to lower investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums and lower persistency than our model projections assumed, partially offset by lower death claims and lapse rates than our model projections assumed;        ·   An increase in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups in the first quarter of 2009; and        ·   The inter-company reinsurance arrangement effective December 31, 2009, discussed below, which resulted in reductions in net investment income and an increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses.      We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. Products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated under Actuarial Guideline 38, or The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AG38”). Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the strain of increasing AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with secondary guarantee UL and term products. As discussed further below, we have been successful in executing reinsurance solutions to release capital to Other Operations. We expect to regularly execute transactions designed to release capital as we continue to sell products that are subject to these reserving requirements. We also plan to refinance prior transactions as discussed further below. Recently, we introduced new secondary guarantee UL products that achieve our return requirements without dependency on such reinsurance solutions.        91           During the second quarter of 2010, we replaced credit facilities that were to mature in the first quarter of 2011 and completed a $500 million 30-year senior notes offering, the proceeds of which will be used in the third quarter of 2010 as part of a long-term financing solution supporting UL business with secondary guarantees. Included in the LOCs issued as of June 30, 2010, as discussed in Note 9 and reported in the credit facilities table below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.2 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of our affiliated reinsurance subsidiaries on UL business with secondary guarantees. The underlying credit facility matures in the second quarter of 2014; however, the LOCs may remain outstanding for one year following the maturity date. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital impact of secondary guarantee UL products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on our in-force secondary guarantee UL business. However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves if such structures are not available. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2009 Form 10-K for further information on XXX reserves. We expect to have an unfavorable impact to earnings beginning in the third quarter of 2010 related to fees associated with the long-term financing solution and LOCs issued under the new credit facility mentioned above of approximately $5 million per quarter.   As of December 31, 2009, we released approximately $400 million of capital that had previously supported statutory reserves related to our term products as a result of executing on a letter of credit transaction with a third party to support an inter-company reinsurance arrangement. As part of this transaction, we entered into a $550 million 10-year LOC facility related to this business. For more information on this transaction, see our current report on Form 8-K filed on January 7, 2010. This reduction in capital lowered the level of invested assets required to support the reserves of this business, which we transferred to Other Operations where we maintain capital not allocated to our businesses. The cost of the LOC reflected in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, together with the impact of lower net investment income associated with assets shifting from backing reserves in this segment to surplus in Other Operations, has reduced this segment’s quarterly income from operations by approximately $7 million, $4 million of which is simply a shift to Other Operations due to the transfer of invested assets.   Additional Information   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform. This conversion will harmonize methods and processes and involves an upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis capabilities. As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing assumptions and methods of calculations that exist between similar blocks of business within our actuarial models. This exercise may result in material one-time gain and loss adjustments to our results of operations and may result in changes to earnings trends. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations from any differences that may exist upon completion of the conversion. We expect to substantially complete the most critical phases of the conversion by the end of 2010. In the third quarter of each year, we also conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA and DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2009 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our prospective unlocking process.   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first six months of 2010, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in higher expenses.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first six months of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Effective March 31, 2009, we transferred a closed block of business consisting of certain UL and VUL insurance products to a third party. During the fourth quarter of 2009, one of our insurance subsidiaries executed a separate agreement whereby we assumed the mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis. These transactions caused an approximate $6 million per quarter ongoing reduction in this segment’s income from operations as a result of reductions in insurance fees and net investment income, partially offset by reductions in interest credited and benefits. The assumption of the mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis resulted in an approximate $13 million per quarter ongoing increase in insurance premiums offset by an increase in benefits. The unfavorable impact to this segment’s income from operations was partially offset by an approximate $2 million per quarter ongoing increase to income from operations in Other Operations, as a result of having higher net investment income due to the transfer of invested assets from Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance. The transfer of invested assets from this segment was attributable to a reduction in capital as a result of the transfer of this business to a third party. These transactions caused a net $4 million per quarter ongoing reduction to our consolidated net income. Effective April 1, 2010, the agreement to assume the mortality risk associated with this business on a yearly-renewable basis was terminated and        92           replaced with an inter-company reinsurance agreement that effectively resulted in no change to the impact to income from operations discussed above and removed any impacts to insurance premiums and benefits.   On January 1, 2010, we implemented a 20 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which reduced crediting rates by approximately 3 basis points. On March 1, 2009, we implemented a 15 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which reduced crediting rates by approximately 5 basis points.   We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” and “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.”   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.   Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Insurance Fees                                        Mortality assessments    $ 325     $ 320       2 %   $ 643     $ 664       -3 %   Expense assessments      192       173       11 %     392       351       12 %   Surrender charges      24       27       -11 %     55       48       15 %   DFEL:                                                    Deferrals      (114 )     (100 )     -14 %     (232 )     (197 )     -18 %   Amortization, net of interest:                                                    Retrospective unlocking      7       1      NM        15       4       275 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding                                                    unlocking      41       29       41 %     80       62       29 %   Total insurance fees    $ 475     $ 450       6 %   $ 953     $ 932       2 %            93                      For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Sales by Product                                        UL:                                        Excluding MoneyGuard®    $ 78     $ 85       -8 %   $ 168     $ 188       -11 %   MoneyGuard®      23       14       64 %     41       25       64 %   Total UL      101       99       2 %     209       213       -2 %   VUL      10       7       43 %     17       16       6 %   COLI and BOLI      10       5       100 %     17       16       6 %   Term/whole life      19       13       46 %     39       24       63 %   Total sales    $ 140     $ 124       13 %   $ 282     $ 269       5 %                                                      Net Flows                                                    Deposits    $ 1,063     $ 1,020       4 %   $ 2,140     $ 2,077       3 %   Withdrawals and deaths      (413 )     (480 )     14 %     (888 )     (980 )     9 %   Net flows    $ 650     $ 540       20 %   $ 1,252     $ 1,097       14 %                                                      Contract holder assessments    $ 752     $ 733       3 %   $ 1,515     $ 1,458       4 %             As of June 30,                2010       2009       Change      Account Values                      UL    $ 25,425     $ 24,502       4 %   VUL      4,284       3,843       11 %   Interest-sensitive whole life      2,256       2,277       -1 %   Total account values    $ 31,965     $ 30,622       4 %                              In-Force Face Amount                            UL and other    $ 293,013     $ 288,632       2 %   Term insurance      259,450       238,901       9 %   Total in-force face amount    $ 552,463     $ 527,533       5 %     Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:       ·   UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;        ·   MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and        ·   Whole life and term – 100% of first year paid premiums.      UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 40% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of June 30, 2010, and approximately 52% and 57% of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively. Actuarial Guideline 37, or Variable Life Reserves for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, and AG38 impose additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.          94           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                        estate and other, net of investment expenses    $ 500     $ 486       3 %   $ 988     $ 966       2 %   Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                    bond makewhole premiums (1)      6       4       50 %     10       4       150 %   Alternative investments (2)      14       (49 )     129 %     27       (53 )     151 %   Surplus investments (3)      25       12       108 %     50       34       47 %   Total net investment income    $ 545     $ 453       20 %   $ 1,075     $ 951       13 %                                                      Interest Credited    $ 299     $ 291       3 %   $ 596     $ 594       0 %         (1)   See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts. Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at a faster rate than account values. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Additionally, we establish a reserve for reinsurance margin (reinsurance premiums paid less death benefit recoveries) and amortize this margin over the life of the expected insurance assessments for certain blocks of secondary guarantee UL business. When we experience unfavorable mortality, particularly on higher face amount claims, our reinsurance recoveries can increase significantly and are deferred, which reduces the amount by which the expense for the direct claims are offset by reinsurance. The reinsurance on our secondary guarantee UL business is excess of loss reinsurance, and this block has a large range of face amounts, both of which contribute to volatility in our actual experience of reinsurance recoveries as compared to our expectations.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, the decrease is primarily a result of incurred deferrable commissions declining at a rate higher than sales.            97           Insurance Solutions – Group Protection   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Operating Revenues                                        Insurance premiums    $ 434     $ 413       5 %   $ 843     $ 803       5 %   Net investment income      34       28       21 %     68       58       17 %   Other revenues and fees      2       2       0 %     4       3       33 %   Total operating revenues      470       443       6 %     915       864       6 %   Operating Expenses                                                    Interest credited      -       1       -100 %     1       1       0 %   Benefits      334       292       14 %     645       575       12 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                                                    expenses      101       98       3 %     202       197       3 %   Total operating expenses      435       391       11 %     848       773       10 %   Income from operations before taxes      35       52       -33 %     67       91       -26 %   Federal income tax expense      12       18       -33 %     23       32       -28 %   Income from operations    $ 23     $ 34       -32 %   $ 44     $ 59       -25 %             For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Income from Operations by Product Line                                        Life    $ 16     $ 13       23 %   $ 19     $ 13       46 %   Disability      7       20       -65 %     25       46       -46 %   Dental      (1 )     (1 )     0 %     (3 )     (3 )     0 %   Total non-medical      22       32       -31 %     41       56       -27 %   Medical      1       2       -50 %     3       3       0 %   Total income from operations    $ 23     $ 34       -32 %   $ 44     $ 59       -25 %     Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Income from operations for this segment decreased due to unfavorable total non-medical loss ratio experience in the second quarter of 2010 that was above the high end of our historical expected range of 71% to 74% attributable primarily to unfavorable claims incidence and termination experience on our long-term disability business.   When comparing the six months ended June 30, 2010 to 2009, the decrease in income from operations was also attributable to unfavorable total non-medical loss ratio experience due to unfavorable claims incidence and termination experience, mentioned above, and to adverse mortality experience in the first quarter of 2010.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·   Growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products and strong case persistency; and        ·   Higher net investment income driven by an increase in business and more favorable results from our investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information).             98           Additional Information   During the second quarter of 2010, our non-medical loss ratio came in at 76%, above what we experienced last quarter and above our long-term expectation in the low 70% range. During the first quarter of 2010, we experienced significantly unfavorable life loss ratios due primarily to adverse mortality experience, which improved in the second quarter of 2010 to more expected levels. Also during the second quarter of 2010, we experienced significantly unfavorable long-term disability loss ratios due primarily to unfavorable incidence, and to a lesser extent termination experience. We attribute the unfavorable claims incidence experience to be related to the increasing trend in submitted long-term disability claims, specifically in the healthcare, education and financial sectors, which we expect will continue in the short term. We expect loss ratios to recover over time but are likely to remain elevated for the remainder of the year. Management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claim experience is inherently uncertain.   During the first six months of 2009, we experienced exceptional short- and long-term disability loss ratios due primarily to favorable claims incidence and termination experience. In addition, we experienced significantly unfavorable life loss ratios in the first six months of 2009 due primarily to adverse mortality experience, the downward effects of whole-case pricing on premium rates and a one-time adjustment to benefits of $3 million relating to unfavorable waiver claim reserves.   We expect to review the discount rate assumptions associated with our long-term disability claim reserves during the third quarter of 2010. For more information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates.”   We allocated more overhead costs to this segment during the first six months of 2010, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses. See “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details. Additionally, we plan to make strategic investments during 2010 that will also result in higher expenses.   We experienced a favorable decline in expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans during the first six months of 2010 when compared to the corresponding period in 2009, and this trend will continue for the remainder of 2010. For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.        99             The business represented as “medical” consists primarily of our non-core EXEC-U-CARE® product. This product provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non-covered health plan costs. This product produces significant revenues and benefits expenses for this segment but only a limited amount of income. Discontinuance of this product would significantly impact segment revenues, but not income from operations.   Net Investment Income   We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.

Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.              101           RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries; investments in media properties and other corporate investments; benefit plan net liability; the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to the sale of reinsurance to Swiss Re in 2001; the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of a reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re; the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed-block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off; and debt costs. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value.

The decrease in loss from operations was partially offset by higher interest and debt expenses as a result of an increase in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and higher average balances of outstanding debt in 2010.   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Loss from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·   The $64 million unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2009 of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re, which resulted in pre-tax increases in benefits of $78 million, interest credited of $15 million and other expenses of $5 million, partially offset by a $34 million tax benefit;           102                 ·   Lower other expenses due primarily to:            §   Restructuring charges for expense initiatives in the first six months of 2009; and            §   Higher merger-related expenses in the first six months of 2009; and        ·   Higher net investment income related primarily to higher invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, issuances of common stock and preferred stock and proceeds from the sale of Delaware.      The decrease in loss from operations was partially offset by higher interest and debt expenses as a result of an increase in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and higher average balances of outstanding debt in 2010.   Additional Information   We expect a lower loss from operations for Other Operations in 2010 than was experienced in 2009. The expected decrease is attributable primarily to the following:       ·   Lower expenses attributable to the completion of our expense reduction initiatives in 2009 (see “Results of Other Operations – Additional Information” in our 2009 Form 10-K for details), partially offset by expected increases in branding costs and investments in strategic initiatives and higher allocated overhead costs during 2010, as the disposal of our Lincoln UK and Investment Management businesses resulted in a reallocation of overhead expenses to our remaining businesses (see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional details);        ·   Higher investment income from an increase in the distributable earnings that will be received from our insurance segments due to expected less challenging economic conditions; and        ·   The unfavorable impact of the rescission in 2009 of the reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re for disability income business that we do not expect to recur.      The inclusion of run-off disability income business results within Other Operations due to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement mentioned above may create volatility in earnings going forward.   We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The inter-segment cash management program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.   Write-downs for OTTI decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.   The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.          103           Other Expenses   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Other Expenses                                        Merger-related expenses    $ 2     $ 4       -50 %   $ 4     $ 11       -64 %   Restructuring charges for expense initiatives      -       29       -100 %     -       34       -100 %   Branding      8       4       100 %     13       9       44 %   Retirement Income Security Ventures      3       2       50 %     5       4       25 %   Taxes, licenses and fees      (2 )     1      NM        (1 )     2      NM      Other      26       21       24 %     45       37       22 %   Total other expenses    $ 37     $ 61       -39 %   $ 66     $ 97       -32 %     Other in the table above includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations.   Merger-related expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. These actions were substantially completed during 2009, as we only expect to incur $9 million, pre-tax, during 2010. As of December 31, 2009, our cumulative integration expense was approximately $225 million, pre-tax, which excluded amounts capitalized or recorded as goodwill.   Starting in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing expenses. The expenses associated with this initiative are reported in restructuring charges for expense initiatives above. These actions were completed during 2009. Our cumulative pre-tax charges amounted to $42 million for severance, benefits and related costs associated with the plan for workforce reduction and other restructuring actions.   Interest and Debt Expense   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   For information on our counterparty exposure see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 to 2009   Our realized loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, decreased significantly as compared to our experience throughout 2009 due primarily to the decline in OTTI attributable primarily to general improvement in the credit markets and more favorable hedge program performance, partially offset by losses on derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs.   Our GLB net derivatives results and GDB derivative results during the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, were modestly favorable as compared to unfavorable during the corresponding periods of 2009. The GLB net derivatives results during the three months ended June 30, 2010, were significantly affected by market volatility as we maintained an under-hedged position during the second quarter of 2010, but the under-hedged position was almost entirely offset by movement in the NPR. The unfavorable GLB net derivatives results during 2009 were attributable primarily to increases in interest rates and our over-hedged position for a period of time in 2009. The unfavorable GDB derivative results during 2009 were driven primarily by sporadic large movements in rates and equities that caused non-linear changes in the liability relative to the derivatives utilized in the hedge program and by other items.   The unfavorable realized loss related to certain derivative instruments and trading securities during 2010 was attributable primarily to spreads widening on corporate credit default swaps, which affected the derivative instruments related to our consolidated VIEs, partially offset by gains on our trading securities due to the decline in interest rates.        105             For information regarding realized gains (losses) related to certain investments, see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below.

(2)   Related primarily to the emergence of gross profits.      Operating realized gain (loss) includes the following:   Indexed Annuity Net Derivative Results   Indexed annuity net derivatives results represent the net difference between the change in the fair value of the S&P 500 call options that we hold and the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity products. The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.   GLB   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC, we record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).          106           The NPR factors affect the discount rate used in the calculation of the GLB embedded derivative reserve. Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the embedded derivative reserve utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to a series of expected cash flows over the expected life of the embedded derivative. Our cash flows consist of both expected fees to be received from contract holders and benefits to be paid, and these cash flows are different on a pre- and post- NPR basis. We utilize a model based on our holding company’s credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads adjusted for items, such as the liquidity of our holding company CDS. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply items, such as the impact of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries.   Details underlying the NPR component and associated impact to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as follows:           As of       As of       As of       As of       As of          June 30,       March 31,       December 31,       September 30,       June 30,          2010       2010       2009       2009       2009      10-year CDS spread      2.94 %     1.64 %     1.68 %     2.49 %     5.52 %   NPR factor related                                            to 10-year CDS spread      0.40 %     0.11 %     0.08 %     0.20 %     0.82 %   Unadjusted embedded                                            derivative liability    $ 1,786     $ 461     $ 643     $ 1,014     $ 1,197       Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and the shape of the spread curve. Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of June 30, 2010, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve, then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an unfavorable impact to net income of approximately $184 million, pre-DAC* and tax. Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher along all points on the spread curve as of June 30, 2010, then there would have been a favorable impact to net income of approximately $75 million to $100 million, pre-DAC* and tax. Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly in future periods. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spreads and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.       *   DAC refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL.      We include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain (loss) and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized gain (loss). For our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below.   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Derivative Instruments, Including Those Associated With Our Consolidated VIEs, and Trading Securities   Realized gain (loss) related to certain derivative instruments, including those associated with our consolidated VIEs and trading securities represents changes in the fair values of certain derivative investments (including the credit default swaps and contingent forwards associated with consolidated VIEs), total return swaps (embedded derivatives that are theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements) and trading securities.

GLB Net Derivatives Results   Our GLB net derivatives results are comprised of the net valuation premium, the change in the GLB embedded derivative reserves and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge them, including the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both benefit reserves and embedded derivative reserves. We calculate the value of the embedded derivative reserve and the benefit reserve based on the specific characteristics of each GLB feature. We record the embedded derivative reserve on our GLBs at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from changes in the GLB embedded derivatives reserves. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in embedded derivative reserves. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. When we assess the effectiveness of our hedge program, we        108           exclude the impact of the change in the component of the embedded derivative reserves related to the required NPR. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. As of June 30, 2010, the net effect of the NPR resulted in a $117 million decrease in the liability for our GLB embedded derivative reserves. See above for information regarding the effect of the NPR on the GLB net derivatives results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, and 2009. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above.   GDB Derivatives Results   Our GDB derivatives results represent the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the change in our benefit ratio unlocking, excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments.

The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products accounted for under the Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the FASB ASC. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.            109           CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS   Details underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as follows:                 Percentage of Total Investments          As of       As of       As of       As of          June 30,       December 31,       June 30,       December 31,          2010       2009       2010       2009      Investments                            AFS securities:                            Fixed maturity    $ 66,391     $ 60,818       80.0 %     80.1 %   VIEs' fixed maturity      581       -       0.7 %     0.0 %    Total fixed maturity      66,972       60,818       80.7 %     80.1 %   Equity      246       278       0.3 %     0.4 %   Trading securities      2,608       2,505       3.1 %     3.3 %   Mortgage loans on real estate      6,882       7,178       8.3 %     9.5 %   Real estate      218       174       0.3 %     0.2 %   Policy loans      2,902       2,898       3.5 %     3.8 %   Derivative investments      1,989       1,010       2.4 %     1.3 %   Alternative investments      719       696       0.9 %     0.9 %   Other investments      417       361       0.5 %     0.5 %   Total investments    $ 82,953     $ 75,918       100.0 %     100.0 %     Investment Objective   Invested assets are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2009 Form 10-K.   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both AFS and trading portfolios.   Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.        110                       As of June 30, 2010                      Unrealized                      Amortized       Unrealized       Losses       Fair       % Fair          Cost       Gains       and OTTI       Value       Value      Fixed Maturity AFS Securities                                  Industry corporate bonds:                                  Financial services    $ 8,287     $ 429     $ 158     $ 8,558       12.8 %   Basic industry      2,255       187       32       2,410       3.6 %   Capital goods      3,328       283       27       3,584       5.4 %   Communications      2,913       258       26       3,145       4.7 %   Consumer cyclical      2,584       221       48       2,757       4.1 %   Consumer non-cyclical      6,859       745       3       7,601       11.3 %   Energy      4,391       393       56       4,728       7.1 %   Technology      1,220       132       -

Refer to the “Trading Securities” section of our 2009 Form 10-K for further details.           112           AFS Securities   The general intent of the AFS accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated OCI. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:             Rating Agency       As of June 30, 2010       As of December 31, 2009      NAIC       Equivalent       Amortized       Fair       % of       Amortized       Fair       % of      Designation       Designation       Cost       Value       Total       Cost       Value       Total      Investment Grade Securities                                           1      Aaa / Aa / A      $ 38,877     $ 41,588       62.1 %   $ 35,041     $ 35,924       59.0 %    2      Baa        20,682       21,897       32.7 %     20,294       20,725       34.1 %   Total investment grade securities        59,559       63,485       94.8 %     55,335       56,649       93.1 %   Below Investment Grade Securities                                                       3      Ba        2,843       2,456       3.7 %     3,221       2,695       4.5 %    4     B       906       637       1.0 %     1,470       948       1.6 %    5      Caa and lower        330       231       0.3 %     426       265       0.4 %    6      In or near default        251       163       0.2 %     305       261       0.4 %   Total below investment grade securities        4,330       3,487       5.2 %     5,422       4,169       6.9 %   Total fixed maturity AFS securities      $ 63,889     $ 66,972       100.0 %   $ 60,757     $ 60,818       100.0 %   Total securities below investment grade                                                      as a percentage of total fixed                                                      maturity AFS securities        6.8 %     5.2 %             8.9 %     6.9 %             Comparisons between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be below investment grade by the rating agencies, which is a result of the changes in the RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) that were effective December 31, 2009, for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).   As of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, 67.4% and 80.3%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses on AFS securities decreased $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010, which was attributable to a decline in overall market yields, which was driven, in part, by improved credit fundamentals. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2010, does not represent OTTI as we do not intend to sell these debt securities, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, or we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our AFS securities unrealized losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.          113           Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) was as follows:           As of June 30, 2010                    Estimated     Estimated                            Gross     Years     Average                            Unrealized     until Call     Years                      Fair       Losses and     or     until       Subordination Level          Value       OTTI     Maturity     Recovery       Current       Origination      CMBS    $ 468     $ 274    1 to 43      29       21.2 %     17.2 %   Hybrid and redeemable                                              preferred securities      851       197    1 to 58      35      NA       NA        As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2009 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.   The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.   We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:       ·   The current economic environment and market conditions;        ·   Our business strategy and current business plans;        ·   The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;        ·   Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;        ·   The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        ·   The capital risk limits approved by management; and        ·   Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.      To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:       ·   Historic and implied volatility of the security;        ·   Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;        ·   Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;        ·   Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and        ·   Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.             114           As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $86.7 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $76.3 billion as of June 30, 2010. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $58.5 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $581 million, as of June 30, 2010, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point of time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K and Note 5 for additional discussion.   The estimated fair value for all private securities was $8.4 billion and $8.0 billion as of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively, representing approximately 10% and 11% of total invested assets as of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively.   For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 4. For discussion of our investments in CLNs as of December 31, 2009, see our 2009 Form 10-K CLNs section in Note 5.   Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)   Our fixed maturity securities include MBS. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.   We limit the extent of our risk on MBS by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk MBS. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of June 30, 2010, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk, trust structured MBS. A significant amount of assets in our MBS portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.   Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS CDOs, ABS and RMBS. Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime; Alt-A; and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.   The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards over the last several years have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $10.5 billion and an unrealized loss of $147 million, or 1%, as of June 30, 2010. The unrealized loss was due primarily to weak housing fundamentals and although liquidity has improved in recent quarters, a general level of illiquidity still exists in the market resulting in price declines in many structured products.          115           The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $467 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of June 30, 2010.

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.   The following summarizes our exposure to Monoline insurers (in millions):           As of June 30, 2010                                  Total                            Total       Total       Unrealized       Total          Direct       Insured       Amortized       Unrealized       Loss       Fair          Exposure (1)       Bonds (2)       Cost       Gain       and OTTI       Value      Monoline Name                                        AMBAC    $ -     $ 248     $ 248     $ 4     $ 58     $ 194     ASSURED GUARANTY LTD      30       -       30       -       18       12     FGIC      -       86       86       1       26       61     FSA      -       55       55       1       2       54     MBIA      12       149       161       15       18       158     MGIC      11       6       17       -       1       16     PMI GROUP INC      27       -       27       -       10       17     RADIAN GROUP INC      19       -       19       -       3       16     XL CAPITAL LTD      72       63       135       2       12       125     Total by Monoline insurer (3)    $ 171     $ 607     $ 778     $ 23     $ 148     $ 653                                                        Total AFS securities                    $ 64,245     $ 4,730     $ 1,757     $ 67,218     Total by Monoline insurer as a                                                    percentage of total AFS securities                      1.2 %     0.5 %     8.4 %     1.0 %         (1)   Additional direct exposure through credit default swaps with a notional value totaling $20 million is excluded from this table.        (2)   Additional indirect insured exposure through structured securities is excluded from this table.        (3)   Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $30 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $30 million in trading securities consisted of $10 million of direct exposure and $20 million of insured exposure. This table also excludes insured exposure totaling $12 million for a guaranteed investment tax credit partnership.      Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.        120           We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities. The composition by industry categories of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status (in millions) for our securities that we believe were most at risk of impairment, was as follows:           As of June 30, 2010                                        %                %             %       Unrealized       Unrealized          Fair       Fair       Amortized       Amortized       Loss       Loss          Value       Value       Cost       Cost       and OTTI       and OTTI      Banking    $ 75       31.7 %   $ 110       28.6 %   $ 35       23.6 %   CMOs      30       12.7 %     64       16.6 %     34       23.0 %   ABS      47       19.8 %     78       20.2 %     31       20.9 %   CMBS      2       0.8 %     29       7.5 %     27       18.2 %   Property and casualty insurers      52       22.0 %     70       18.2 %     18       12.2 %   Industrial - other      4       1.7 %     6       1.6 %     2       1.4 %   Non-agency      1       0.4 %     2       0.5 %     1       0.7 %   Gaming      15       6.3 %     15       3.9 %     -       0.0 %   Financial - other      11       4.6 %     11       2.9 %     -       0.0 %   Total securities subject to                                                    enhanced analysis                                                    and monitoring    $ 237       100.0 %   $ 385       100.0 %   $ 148       100.0 %                                                      Total AFS securities    $ 67,218             $ 64,245             $ 1,757             Total securities subject to                                                    enhanced analysis and                                                    monitoring as a percentage                                                    of total AFS securities      0.4 %             0.6 %             8.4 %             In addition, as discussed in Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K, we perform detailed analysis of our AFS securities, including those presented above as well as other AFS securities.

These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.          128           Loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of mortgage loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value at origination of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the principal amount is greater than the collateral value. Therefore, all else being equal, a smaller loan-to-value ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service payments. Debt-service coverage ratios of less than 1.0 indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover its current debt payments. Therefore, all else being equal, a larger debt-service coverage ratio generally indicates a higher quality loan. The following summarizes our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios (in millions):           As of June 30, 2010      Loan-to-Value     Principal Amount       %       Debt- Service Coverage      Less than 65%    $ 4,830       70.2 %     1.65     65% to 75%      1,685       24.5 %     1.42     Greater than 75%      365       5.3 %     0.79     Total mortgage loans    $ 6,880       100.0 %             All mortgage loans that are impaired have an established allowance for credit loss. Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were 10 impaired mortgage loans as of June 30, 2010, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans. The carrying value on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of June 30, 2010, was $52 million, or 1% of total mortgage loans. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of June 30, 2010, was $3 million. The carrying value on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2009, was $36 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2009, was $2 million. See Note 1 in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.   Alternative Investments   The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consisted primarily of investments in limited partnerships, was as follows:           As of       As of          June 30,       December 31,          2010       2009      Retirement Solutions:                Annuities    $ 94     $ 85     Defined Contribution      72       65     Insurance Solutions:                    Life Insurance      524       485     Group Protection      30       32     Other Operations      (1 )     29     Total alternative investments    $ 719     $ 696                129           Income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Retirement Solutions:                                        Annuities    $ 3     $ (8 )     138 %   $ 6     $ (8 )     175 %   Defined Contribution      2       (5 )     140 %     4       (5 )     180 %   Insurance Solutions:                                                    Life Insurance      18       (56 )     132 %     32       (62 )     152 %   Group Protection      1       (3 )     133 %     2       (3 )     167 %   Other Operations      -       1       -100 %     -       1       -100 %   Total alternative investments (1)    $ 24     $ (71 )     134 %   $ 44     $ (77 )     157 %         (1)   Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.      The increase in our investment income on alternative investments presented in the table above when comparing the first six months of 2010 to the same period in 2009 was due primarily to the impact of audit adjustments in 2009 related to completion of 2008 calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees within our portfolio and overall improvement in the equity markets in 2010 specifically benefiting our hedge fund, venture capital and energy limited partnership holdings.   As of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, alternative investments included investments in approximately 96 and 99 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented less than 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments,” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we update the carrying value of our alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the investees for the preceding year become available. Our investment income from alternative investments for the second quarter of 2010 included a pre-tax gain of $7 million attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2009 financial statements. The breakdown of these audit adjustments by segment was as follows: $4 million for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance; $1 million for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection; $1 million for Retirement Solutions – Annuities; and $1 million for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution.   Non-Income Producing Investments   As of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $26 million and $38 million, respectively.          130           Net Investment Income   Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Net Investment Income                                        Fixed maturity AFS securities    $ 913     $ 854       6.9 %   $ 1,815     $ 1,679       8 %   VIEs' fixed maturity AFS securities      4       -      NM        8       -      NM      Equity AFS securities      1       2       -50.0 %     3       3       0 %   Trading securities      39       39       0.0 %     79       79       0 %   Mortgage loans on real estate      106       117       -9.4 %     216       236       -8 %   Real estate      5       4       25.0 %     11       6       83 %   Standby real estate equity                                                    commitments      -       -      NM        1       1       0 %   Policy loans      43       42       2.4 %     85       86       -1 %   Invested cash      2       4       -50.0 %     3       12       -75 %   Commercial mortgage loan                                                    prepayment and bond                                                    makewhole premiums (1)      12       4       200.0 %     17       4      NM      Alternative investments (2)      24       (71 )     133.8 %     44       (77 )     157 %   Consent fees      1       2       -50.0 %     1       2       -50 %   Other investments      1       2       -50.0 %     3       5       -40 %   Investment income      1,151       999       15.2 %     2,286       2,036       12 %   Investment expense      (31 )     (28 )     -10.7 %     (60 )     (52 )     -15 %   Net investment income    $ 1,120     $ 971       15.3 %   $ 2,226     $ 1,984       12 %         (1)   See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   The increase in net investment income when comparing the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, to the corresponding periods of 2009 was attributable to more favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments, higher prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (see “Alternative Investments” above and “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for more information) and higher invested assets driven primarily by favorable net flows on fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable and to a lesser extent issuances of common stock and debt.   Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments   Historically, we have entered into standby commitments, which obligated us to purchase real estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within approximately one year after construction is completed. These commitments were used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an outside lender on favorable terms. In return for issuing the commitment, we received an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the property is sold. Our historical long-term expectation had been that we will be obligated to fund a small portion of our commitments that remain outstanding. However, due to the economic environment over the last few years, we have experienced increased funding obligations.   As of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, we had standby real estate equity commitments totaling $86 million and $220 million, respectively. During the first six months of 2010, we funded commitments of $112 million and recorded a loss of $8 million. During 2009, we recorded a $69 million estimated allowance for loss on projects due to our belief that our requirement to fund the projects in accordance with the standby equity commitments would result in a probable future loss. Certain of these commitments were funded during 2010 and the allowance for loss was $21 million as of June 30, 2010.   We have suspended our practice of entering into new standby real estate commitments.    Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   The increase in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing 2010 to 2009 was attributable primarily to the overall improvement in the capital markets and real estate financing, which resulted in more refinancing activity and more prepayment income.          132           Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   The detail of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Fixed maturity AFS securities:                                        Gross gains    $ 35     $ 33       6 %   $ 84     $ 86       -2 %   Gross losses      (29 )     (172 )     83 %     (113 )     (413 )     73 %   Equity AFS securities:                                                    Gross gains      5       1      NM        6       4      NM      Gross losses      -       (6 )     100 %     (4 )     (9 )     56 %   Gain (loss) on other investments      (8 )     (58 )     86 %     (29 )     (60 )     52 %   Associated amortization                                                    income (expense) of DAC, VOBA,              DSI and DFEL and in other                                                    contract holder funds      (8 )     48      NM        (4 )     104      NM      Total realized gain (loss)                                                    related to certain                                                    investments    $ (5 )   $ (154 )     97 %   $ (60 )   $ (288 )     79 %     Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2010 and 2009, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored.

Losses in 2010 were attributable primarily to certain corporate bond holdings within the entertainment and banking sectors, as well as deteriorating fundamentals within the housing market that affected select RMBS holdings.            134           REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $873 million and $447 million for the first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or increase). During the first six months of 2010, our payables for collateral on derivative investments increased by $804 million as declines in the equity and credit markets and interest rates resulted in increased derivative fair values. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.   We believe that the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to the U.S. life insurance sector and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. During May and June of 2010, Moody’s, Fitch and A.M. Best all improved their outlook on our company to stable from negative, and S&P’s outlook remained stable. For more information about ratings, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2009 Form 10-K and our Form 8-K filed on June 2, 2010.   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Dividends from Subsidiaries                                        The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company                                         ("LNL")    $ 275     $ 405       -32 %   $ 275     $ 405       -32 %   Lincoln Financial Media      -       2       -100 %     -       2       -100 %   First Penn-Pacific      -       50       -100 %     -       50       -100 %   Delaware Investments (1)      -       3       -100 %     390       5      NM      Lincoln Barbados      -       300       -100 %     -       300       -100 %   Other      7       -      NM        22       -      NM      Loan Repayments and Interest from                                                     Subsidiary                                                    LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)      19       19       0 %     41       41       0 %      $ 301     $ 779       -61 %   $ 728     $ 803       -9 %   Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                                    Net proceeds on common stock issuance    $ 368     $ 660       -44 %   $ 368     $ 660       -44 %   Lincoln UK sale proceeds      18       -      NM        18       -      NM         $ 386     $ 660       -42 %   $ 386     $ 660       -42 %         (1)   For 2010, amount includes proceeds on the sale of Delaware. For more information, see Note 3.        (2)   Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.           135             The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.   Dividends from Subsidiaries   Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” in our 2009 Form 10-K, we may not consider the benefit from the statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available dividends. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.   We expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $730 million in 2010 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.   We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further OTTI could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   For discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and XXX statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”   Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.   On June 30, 2010, after consultation with the OTS, we redeemed our Series B preferred stock that we had issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. We funded the $950 million liquidation value of the stock with proceeds from a $368 million common stock offering, proceeds from a $250 million five-year senior notes offering (both mentioned below) and with cash that was held at our holding company, which was attributable primarily to proceeds from the sale of Delaware. As a result of repurchasing the preferred stock, we accelerated the remaining accretion of the preferred stock issuance discount of $131 million and recorded a corresponding charge to retained earnings and income (loss) available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per common share. The U.S. Treasury continues to hold a warrant to purchase 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.92 per share. We notified the U.S. Treasury that we will not repurchase the warrant, which under the terms of the agreement between the parties acts as U.S. Treasury's notice to us of its intention to sell the warrant.   On June 18, 2010, we closed on the sale of 14,137,615 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $27.25 per share and also completed the sale of $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.3% senior notes due 2015, In addition, we completed        136           the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 7% senior notes due 2040, and we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as part of a long-term financing solution supporting the life reserves of certain UL products of our insurance subsidiaries (see in “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Income from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” for more information). The net proceeds from these offerings were $1.1 billion. For more information about our debt issuances, see Note 9.   On January 4, 2010, we closed on the sale of Delaware and received after-tax proceeds of approximately $405 million. On October 1, 2009, we closed on the sale of Lincoln UK and received after-tax proceeds of $307 million. As a result of post-closing adjustments related to this transaction, we received additional consideration of $18 million, after-tax, during the second quarter of 2010. For more information on the disposition of these businesses, see Note 3.   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:           For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2010                            Change                                  Maturities       in Fair                      Beginning             and       Value       Other       Ending          Balance       Issuance       Repayments       Hedges       Changes (1)       Balance      Short-Term Debt                                        Commercial paper    $ 99     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ (1 )   $ 98     Current maturities of long-term debt      250       -       (250 )     -       -       -     Other short-term debt      1       -       -       -       -       1     Total short-term debt    $ 350     $ -     $ (250 )   $ -     $ (1 )   $ 99                                                        Long-Term Debt                                                    Senior notes    $ 2,960     $ 749     $ -     $ 64     $ 2     $ 3,775     Bank borrowing      200       -       -       -       -       200     Federal Home Loan Bank                                                    of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance      250       -       -       -       -       250     Junior subordinated debentures                                                    issued to affiliated trusts      155       -       -       -       -       155     Capital securities      1,485       -       -       -       -       1,485     Total long-term debt    $ 5,050     $ 749     $ -     $ 64     $ 2     $ 5,865           (1)   Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.      On March 12, 2010, we funded the maturity of a $250 million floating rate senior note with the majority of our proceeds from our $300 million 6.25% senior offering in December 2009. Within the next two years, we have a $250 million 6.2% fixed rate senior note maturing on December 15, 2011. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet the 2011 maturity will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of June 30, 2010, the holding company had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents; however, this amount includes proceeds from a $500 million senior notes offering that has not yet been contributed to our insurance subsidiaries as part of the long-term financing solution supporting UL business, mentioned above.          137           Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:                   As of June 30, 2010          Expiration       Maximum       Borrowings            Date       Available       Outstanding        Credit Facilities                        Credit facility with the FHLBI (1)     N/A     $ 630     $ 350       364-day revolving credit facility     Jun-11        500       -  (2)     Four-year revolving credit facility     Jun-14        1,500       -       Ten-year LOC facility     Dec-19        550       -       Total            $ 3,180     $ 350                                    LOCs issued                    $ 2,038               (1)    Our borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration date and continues while our investment in the FHLBI common stock remains outstanding as long as LNL maintains a satisfactory level of creditworthiness and does not incur a material adverse change in its financial, business, regulatory or other areas that would materially affect its operations and viability. As of June 30, 2010, we had a $250 million floating-rate term loan outstanding under the facility (classified within long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets) due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid beginning June 20, 2010. We also borrowed $100 million under the facility (classified within payables for collateral on investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets) at a rate of 0.65% that is due May 25, 2011.         (2)   During the second quarter of 2010, LNC had an average of $98 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $101 million outstanding at any time. As of June 30, 2010, we had commercial paper outstanding of $98 million backed by this facility, which reduced our available credit facility by a corresponding amount, but did not represent loans borrowed by the credit facility.      Effective as of June 9, 2010, we entered into two revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks. One agreement (the “Four-Year Agreement”) allows for issuance of LOCs, as well as borrowings to finance any draws under the LOCs. The Four-Year Agreement is unsecured and has a commitment termination date of June 9, 2014. The Four-Year Agreement must be used primarily to provide LOCs in support of certain life insurance reserves. The second agreement (the “364-Day Agreement,” and together with the “Four-Year Agreement” the “credit facility”) allows for borrowing or issuance of LOCs and may be used for general corporate purposes. The 364-Day Agreement is unsecured and has a commitment termination of June 8, 2011. LOCs issued under the credit facility may remain outstanding for one year following the applicable commitment termination date of each agreement. The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated reinsurance companies, as discussed above in “Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain,” and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.   The credit facility contains customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. The credit facility also includes financial covenants including: maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth (as defined in the facility) equal to the sum of $9.2 billion plus fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate net proceeds of equity issuances received by us in accordance with the terms of the credit facility (other than net proceeds used to repay investments to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP); and a debt-to-capital ratio as defined in accordance with the credit facility not to exceed 0.35 to 1.00. Further, the credit facility contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default. The events of default include payment defaults, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies in representations and warranties, certain cross-defaults, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and other customary defaults. Upon an event of default, the credit facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable. As of June 30, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants.   If current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively impact overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3. Our long-term debt held a rating of BBB/Baa2 as of June 30, 2010. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2009 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2009 Form 10-K for additional information on our current bond ratings.        138             Management monitors the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities. As of June 30, 2010, we had approximately $1.5 billion in principal amount of capital securities outstanding. If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”). If we determine that one of the following triggers exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment date (“determination date”), then the ACSM would apply:          1.   LNL’s RBC ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana); or              2.   (i) the sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative, and (ii) our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding accumulated OCI and any increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter) (“adjusted stockholders’ equity”) as of (x) the most recently completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the quarter that is ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter (the “benchmark quarter”).       The ACSM would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed, and, in the case of test 2 above, our adjusted stockholders’ equity amount increased or declined by less than 10% as compared to the adjusted stockholders’ equity at the end of the benchmark quarter for each interest payment date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed by test 2 above.   If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient shares of common stock or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities, nor will a nonpayment of interest, unless it lasts for ten consecutive years, although such breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital securities.   In recent quarters, we have triggered the net income test as a result of quarterly consolidated net losses. However, recent quarterly consolidated net income and our efforts to raise capital in the form of equity resulted in no trigger of either the net income test or the overall stockholders’ equity test looking forward to the quarters ending September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2010.   The calculations of RBC, net income (loss) and adjusted stockholders’ equity are subject to adjustments and the capital securities are subject to additional terms and conditions as further described in supplemental indentures filed as exhibits to our Forms 8-K filed on March 13, 2007, May 17, 2006, and April 20, 2006.    For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels” and Note 13 in our 2009 Form 10-K.    For information regarding the repurchase of the preferred stock that we had issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP, see “Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions” above.    Alternative Sources of Liquidity    In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.   The holding company did not borrow from the cash management program during the second quarter of 2010. There was no balance as of June 30, 2010. In addition, the holding company had an outstanding receivable of $227 million from certain subsidiaries resulting from funds borrowed by the subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed by those subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account as of June 30, 2010. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.        139             Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2010, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $188 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $335 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Acquisitions and Dispositions” in our 2009 Form 10-K and Note 3.   Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. As a result of the repurchase of the preferred stock that we had issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP, many of the associated restrictions will no longer apply to us, including the limit on increasing the dividend on our common stock.   Details underlying this activity (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three             For the Six                Months Ended             Months Ended                June 30,             June 30,                2010       2009       Change       2010       2009       Change      Common dividends to stockholders    $ 3     $ 3       0 %   $ 6     $ 56       -89 %   Number of shares issued      14.138       46.000       -69 %     14.138       46.000       -69 %   Average price per share    $ 26.09     $ 14.34       82 %   $ 26.09     $ 14.34       82 %     Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be impacted by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K.              140           OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2009 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk, basis risk and credit risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management process, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).          141           Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates   In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbate this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.   Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this threat and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.   The following summarizes solely a hypothetical significant unfavorable stress scenario to earnings if new money rates, currently averaging approximately 75 to 100 basis points below our portfolio yields, remain in place through 2012 as opposed to a scenario that we would expect to occur. This scenario is simply an illustration of the sensitivity to our earnings if such a stress scenario were to happen:       ·   Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance – The stress on earnings has been mitigated by proactive strategies to lock in long-dated and high-yielding assets. We executed on strategies which allowed us to effectively pre-buy assets in anticipation of future flows and maturing securities We estimate the combination of spread compression, unlocking, and increases in reserves would combine to unfavorably affect earnings in the range of approximately $35 million during 2011 and $50 million during 2012. We pursue proactive strategies to lock-in long-dated and high-yielding assets to manage this risk. In addition, if we were to lower our long-term yield assumption by 50 basis points, and unlocked no other assumptions, it could result in a reduction to earnings at adoption of approximately $50 million. Our methodology assumes that new money rates grade from current levels to a long-term yield assumption over time.        ·   Retirement Solutions – The earnings drag from spread compression is modest and largely concentrated in our Defined Contribution segment, which is a function of this segment having higher guaranteed crediting rates and recurring premiums. We estimate that this scenario would have a modest unfavorable earnings impact during 2011 and an approximate impact in the range of $10 million to $15 million during 2012. Our Annuities business is not sensitive to spread compression so there is very little impact estimated. The risk for our Annuities business is more of sharp rising rates and we manage this risk by selling market value adjusted product and through purchase of derivative protection.        ·   Insurance Solutions – Group Projection – The earnings impact is not material and would be primarily related to our review of the discount rate assumptions associated with our long-term disability claim reserves. This evaluation may result in a reduction in the discount rate on new claims that reflects new money rates on assets supporting those reserves. The combination of spread compression and decreases to reserve discount rates would unfavorably affect annualized earnings by less than $5 million.        ·   Other Operations – We may also be impacted by sensitivity to our exposures in our institutional pension and disability run-off blocks of business that are sensitive to interest rates and could contribute to an impact.      The estimates above are based upon a hypothetical stressed scenario and are only representative of the effects of new money rates remaining in place through 2012 keeping all else equal and does not give consideration to the aggregate impact of other factors, including but not limited to: contract holder activity; hedge positions; changing equity markets; shifts in implied volatilities; and changes in other capital market sectors. In addition, the scenario only illustrated the impact to spreads and certain unlocking and reserve changes. Other potential impacts of the scenario were not considered in the analysis.          142           The spreads on our fixed annuity, term life, whole life, interest-sensitive whole life, universal life (“UL”), fixed portion of defined contribution business and fixed portion of variable universal life (“VUL”) insurance policies are at risk if interest rates decline and remain low for a period of time, which has generally been the case in recent years. Should interest rates remain at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity and UL investment portfolios will continue to decline. Declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%. The following table provides detail on the percentage differences between the June 30, 2010, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on third quarter of 2010 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (dollars in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses:           Account Values                      Insurance                      Retirement Solutions       Solutions -             %                Defined       Life             Account          Annuities       Contribution       Insurance       Total       Values      Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                  Discretionary rate setting products (1) (2):                                  No difference    $ 5,102     $ 8,975     $ 20,324     $ 34,401       57.6 %   up to .10%      122       70       191       383       0.6 %   0.11% to .20%      74       -       1,024       1,098       1.8 %   0.21% to .30%      272       -       545       817       1.4 %   0.31% to .40%      66       1       640       707       1.2 %   0.41% to .50%      44       6       678       728       1.2 %   0.51% to .60%      60       -       344       404       0.7 %   0.61% to .70%      11       -       990       1,001       1.7 %   0.71% to .80%      32       -       849       881       1.5 %   0.81% to .90%      9       -       14       23       0.0 %   0.91% to 1.0%      25       158       20       203       0.3 %   1.01% to 1.50%      430       285       518       1,233       2.1 %   1.51% to 2.00%      409       11       575       995       1.7 %   2.01% to 2.50%      232       2       4       238       0.4 %   2.51% to 3.00%      97       154       -       251       0.4 %   3.01% and above      19       51       38       108       0.2 %   Total discretionary rate setting products      7,004       9,713       26,754       43,471       72.8 %   Other contracts (3)      13,393       2,867       -       16,260       27.2 %   Total account values    $ 20,397     $ 12,580     $ 26,754     $ 59,731       100.0 %                                              Percentage of discretionary rate setting product                                            account values at minimum guaranteed rates      73 %     92 %     76 %     79 %                 (1)   Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.        (2)   The average crediting rates in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Defined Contribution and Life Insurance segments were 33 basis points, 12 basis points and 16 basis points, respectively.        (3)   Includes multi-year guarantee annuities, indexed annuities, modified guarantee annuities, single premium immediate annuities, dollar cost averaging contracts and indexed-based rate setting products for our Defined Contribution segment. The average crediting rates in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for indexed-based rate setting products within our Defined Contribution segment was 54 basis points, and 44% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.      The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.        143           Derivatives   We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate futures, interest rate cap agreements, forward-starting interest rate swaps, consumer price index swaps, interest rate cap corridors and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.   Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity   Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies as described in “MD&A – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 2 above and in Item 7 of our 2009 Form 10-K, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets.   The following table presents our estimate of the impact on income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) were to increase to 1100 immediately after June 30, 2010, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, or decrease to 800 immediately after June 30, 2010, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:           S&P 500       S&P 500          at 1100 (1)       at 800 (1)      Segment                Retirement Solutions - Annuities (2)    $ 10     $ (80 )   Retirement Solutions - Defined Contribution (2)      -       (25 )         (1)   The baseline for these impacts assumes 9% annual equity market growth beginning on July 1, 2010. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at the 1100 and 800 levels, which assume the index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at the 1100 and 800 level scenarios is presented in the table.        (2)   If the level of the S&P 500 increased to 1100 immediately after June 30, 2010, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a favorable RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $100 million to $140 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2014. If the level of the S&P 500 decreased to 800 immediately after June 30, 2010, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have an unfavorable RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $200 million to $260 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions late in 2012.      The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.        144           Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. For additional information, see Note 6.   Credit Risk    Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us.   We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of June 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $308 million and $292 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2010, we had exposure to 20 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $139 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. For the majority of Lincoln National Corporation counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB-/Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement. Our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows:             As of       As of            June 30,       December 31,            2010       2009      Rating                  AAA      $ (1 )   $ -     AA        219       202     A       84       82     BBB        6       8     Total      $ 308     $ 292       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2010, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        145             A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in “Part I – Item 1.”   Item 1A. Risk Factors   The risk factor set forth below updates those set forth in Lincoln National Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries (“LNC” or the “Company,” which also may be referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.   Our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate.   We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For our insurance products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the lapse rate of the policies, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive.   As part of our transition plan related to the rescission of a reinsurance treaty covering disability income business, we conducted a reserve study to determine the adequacy of the reserves to cover contract holder obligations during the fourth quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we increased reserves as a result of our review of the adequacy of reserves supporting this business and wrote off certain receivables related to the rescission that were deemed to be uncollectible, which resulted in a $33 million unfavorable effect to net income.   The sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline. The sensitivity will be affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance. Statutory reserves for variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force, and therefore, result in non-linear relationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period.   The assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amount or the timing of the payment of actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future benefits and claims.   We are in the process of completing a conversion of our actuarial valuation systems to a uniform valuation platform. This conversion will harmonize methods and processes and involves an upgrade to a critical platform for our financial reporting and analysis capabilities. As part of this conversion process, we are harmonizing assumptions and methods of calculations that exist between similar blocks of business within our actuarial models. We expect to substantially complete the most critical phases of the conversion by the end of 2010. This exercise may result in material one-time gain and loss adjustments to our results of operations and may result in changes to earnings trends. Although we expect some differences to emerge as a result of this exercise, based upon the current status of these efforts, we are not able to provide an estimate or range of the effects to our results of operations from any differences that may exist upon completion of the conversion.          146           Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.   Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of supervision and regulation covers, among other things:       ·   Standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency, including RBC measurements;        ·   Restrictions of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates;        ·   Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;        ·   Restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations;        ·   Limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay;        ·   The existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business;        ·   Certain required methods of accounting;        ·   Reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and        ·   Assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.      We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company. As of June 30, 2010, no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.   In addition, Lincoln Financial Network and Lincoln Financial Distributors, as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products, are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (“FINRA”). LNC, as a savings and loan holding company, and NCLS are subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”). As a savings and loan holding company, we are also subject to the requirement that our activities be financially-related activities as defined by federal law (which includes insurance activities). These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Finally, our radio operations require a license, subject to periodic renewal, from the Federal Communications Commission to operate. While management considers the likelihood of a failure to renew remote, any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations.   Recently, there has been an increase in potential federal initiatives that would affect the insurance industry. In January 2010, the White House proposed as a part of its budget proposal a new “financial crisis responsibility fee” on certain financial institutions as a means to recoup any shortfall in revenues resulting from the CPP, so that the program does not add to the federal budget deficit. As proposed, the fee would apply to financial institutions, including bank holding companies, thrift holding companies, insured depositories and insurance companies that own one of these entities, with over $50 billion in assets, regardless of whether the firm participated in the CPP. The Congress has not yet acted definitively on legislation to implement the Obama Administration budget proposal regarding the financial crisis responsibility fee.   On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law, the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,” H.R. 4173, a wide-ranging Act that includes a number of reforms of the financial services industry and financial products. The Act includes, among other things, changes to the rules governing derivatives; restrictions on proprietary trading by certain entities; the imposition of capital and leverage requirements on bank and savings and loan holding companies; a study by the SEC of the rules governing broker-dealers and investment advisers with respect to individual investors and investment advice, followed potentially by rulemaking; the creation of a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Treasury to gather information regarding the insurance industry; the creation of a resolution authority to unwind failing institutions, funded on a post-event basis; the creation of a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers of certain financial products; and changes to executive compensation and certain corporate governance rules, among other things. The Act also eliminates the OTS and reallocates the supervisory and regulatory authority over federally chartered thrifts to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and over thrift holding companies to the Federal Reserve. Enactment of this provision ensures that we and NCLS will each have a new        147           regulator and may be subject to additional regulations. Many of the provisions of this act require substantial regulatory work prior to implementation and although we do not expect the Act or the rules to be promulgated thereunder to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, result the ultimate impact of any of these provisions on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources is currently indeterminable.   Many of the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations, regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.   Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.   Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as identified in the FASB Accounting Standards CodifcationTM (“ASC”). From time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance that are incorporated into the FASB ASC. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   For example, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the FASB has issued an exposure draft (EITF 09-G, "Accounting For Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts") on deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), which changes to existing guidance as to the types of costs that insurance companies may capitalize and amortize over the life of the business. The exposure draft limits the types of acquisition costs that a company may defer. We expect the final guidance to significantly reduce the amount of acquisition cost that we will be able to defer in connection with sales of our insurance products. Although this will not affect the ultimate profitability of our products, we expect it could materially alter the pattern of our earnings. In addition, we expect that the final guidance will permit companies to apply the guidance retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2010, our DAC asset was $7.1 billion, pre-tax, or $4.6 billion, after-tax. If we applied the guidance retrospectively, we would write-down a portion of our existing DAC asset that we determined did not qualify as a deferred expense. The amount of the write-down, if any, would reduce the amount of future amortization expense. We expect this guidance to become effective for periods occurring after December 15, 2011. Until the final guidance is issued, the ultimate impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations is unknown.   In addition, the SEC has proposed that large accelerated filers in the U.S. be required to report financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board rather than GAAP. As currently proposed, the earliest this would become effective would begin with a company’s fiscal year 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 2014 Form 10-K would likely include audited IFRS financial statements for the transitional year, as well as the two preceding fiscal years. Thus, an issuer adopting IFRS in 2014 would need to file audited IFRS financial statements for fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014 in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2014. Despite the movement toward convergence of GAAP and IFRS, IFRS will be a complete change to our accounting and reporting and converting to IFRS will impose special demands on issuers in the areas of governance, employee training, internal controls, contract fulfillment and disclosure. As convergence of GAAP and IFRS continues, it could result in significant changes in GAAP that would be implemented whether or not a transition to IFRS actually occurs. The changes to GAAP and ultimate conversion to IFRS will likely affect how we manage our business, as it will likely affect other business processes such as design of compensation plans, product design, etc.   Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals.   Because the profitability of our fixed annuity and universal life insurance (“UL”) and fixed portion of defined contribution and variable universal life insurance (“VUL”) business depends in part on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability. Changes in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital. Some of our products, principally fixed annuities, interest-sensitive whole life, UL and the fixed portion of VUL, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread, or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts. Declines in our spread or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations.   In periods of increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep our interest-sensitive products competitive. We therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. Increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products. In periods of increasing interest        148           rates, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as contract holders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses. These outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. A sudden demand among consumers to change product types or withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds.   In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments then currently available, without taking on additional investment risk. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and since many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.   Currently, new money rates continue to be at historically low levels. If interests rates were to remain low over a sustained period of time, this would put additional pressure on our spreads, potentially resulting in unlocking of our DAC asset and increases in reserves. We would expect the effect to be most pronounced in our Life Insurance segment.   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
