Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments.        •    Operating revenues are revenues recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding realized gains and losses and the amortization of deferred gains arising from reserve development on business sold through reinsurance.        •    Income (loss) from operations is GAAP net income excluding net realized gains and losses, losses on early retirement of debt, reserve development (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance, discontinued operations and the initial impact of the adoption of changes in accounting principles.  Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 16. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information, including moving our Institutional Pension business results to Other Operations that was previously reported in Employer Markets – Retirement Products, to conform to the 2008 presentation.

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, our 2007 Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could impact LNC’s business and financial performance, including “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the risk discussions included in this section under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” “Consolidated Investments” and “Reinsurance,” which are incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, LNC operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.  Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on LNC’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, LNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.  INTRODUCTION  Executive Summary  We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and managed accounts.    32    We provide products and services in four operating businesses: Individual Markets; Employer Markets; Investment Management; and Lincoln UK, and report results through six business segments: Individual Markets – Annuities; Individual Markets – Life Insurance; Employer Markets – Retirement Products; Employer Markets – Group Protection; Investment Management; and Lincoln UK. These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2007 Form 10-K. We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments.  Current Market Conditions  During the quarter, the capital markets continued to experience high volatility that affected both equity market returns and interest rates. In addition, we also saw the widening of credit spreads across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. Due to these challenges, the capital markets had a significant effect on our segment operating income and consolidated net income in the quarter. The markets primarily impact the following areas:  Earnings from Assets Under Management  Our asset gathering segments, Individual Markets – Annuities, Employer Markets – Retirement Products and Investment Management, are sensitive to the equity markets. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values, assets under management and the related asset-based fees below in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2007 to March 31, 2008, the daily average value of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® decreased 10%. Solely as a result of the equity markets, our assets under management as of March 31, 2008, were down $12.2 billion from the end of the year. Because we earn fees on assets under management, the decline in the equity markets reduced fee-based income by approximately $9 million. However, strong deposits over the last year helped to more than offset this impact in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007.  Alternative Investment Income  We believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists mostly of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments, to under-perform relative to our expectations and the prior period. This impact was primarily in our Individual Markets – Life Insurance, Employer Markets – Retirement Products and Individual Markets – Annuities segments. See “Consolidated Investments—Alternative Investments” for additional information on our investment portfolio.  Variable Annuity Living Benefit Hedge Program Results  We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. These guarantees are considered embedded derivatives and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), and SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157 which affected the valuation of our embedded derivatives. See Note 2 of this report for details on the adoption of SFAS 157. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. During the first quarter of 2008, the market conditions noted above negatively affected the net result of the change in the fair value of the living benefit embedded derivative and the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives. However, as we finalized our adoption of SFAS 157 during the first quarter, it resulted in a fair value of the embedded derivative that was lower than the fair value of the derivative instruments creating an over-hedged position driving an overall favorable result for the quarter.  Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses  Related to the credit markets, we experienced net realized losses of $24 million in the first quarter of 2008, which included gross write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments of $92 million, pre-tax. Widening spreads was the primary cause of an increase in gross unrealized losses of $1.2 billion on investments in our general account in the quarter for our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. These unrealized losses were concentrated in the investment grade category of investments and demonstrate how reduced liquidity in the credit markets have resulted in a decline in asset values as investors shift their investments to safer government securities such as U.S. Treasuries.  The effect of the negative equity markets on our assets under management in the first quarter of 2008 will continue to dampen our earnings throughout 2008 even if, for the remainder of the year, the equity market returns are consistent with our     33     long-term assumptions. Accordingly, we may continue to report lower asset-based fees relative to expectations or prior periods. The volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets will also likely result in lower than expected returns on alternative investments. In addition, a continued weakness in the economic environment could lead to increased credit defaults.  In the face of these capital market challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels, targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses.  Strategic and Operational Review  Continual product development and distribution expansion are important to our ability to meet the challenges of the competitive marketplace. In February 2008, our Individual Markets – Annuities segment launched a new guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”), Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage, which includes features such as: a reduced minimum age for lifetime income eligibility; a 5% benefit enhancement in each year an owner does not take a withdrawal; a health care benefit; and a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit. In our Individual Markets – Life Insurance segment, we intend to launch a variable life insurance product in our unified product portfolio in the second quarter of 2008 after receiving appropriate regulatory approvals. Within the mid-sized market of our Employer Markets – Retirement Products segment, we launched our Lincoln SmartFutureSM retirement program to fill the gap between our Alliance program and our group variable annuities.  In terms of increasing our distribution breadth, we launched variable annuity products into two large banks and expect to launch into another bank late in the second quarter of 2008. In support of these and other activities, Lincoln Financial Distributors (“LFD”) increased the number of wholesalers by 5% in the first quarter of 2008 with additional increases expected in the remainder of the year.  Challenges and Outlook  For the remainder of 2008, we expect major challenges to include:        •    Continuation of volatility in the equity and credit markets;        •    Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which creates a challenge for our products that generate investment margin profits, such as fixed annuities and UL;        •    Continuation of decline in the economy or a recession;        •    Achieving success in our unified product portfolio and marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features that will help maintain our competitive position;        •    Continuation of the successful expansion of our wholesale distribution businesses;        •    Ability to improve financial and sales results and increase scale in our Employer Markets and Investment Management businesses;        •    Continuation of focus by the government on tax reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction calculations, which may impact our products and overall earnings;        •    Continuation of competitive pressures in the life insurance and annuity marketplace; and        •    Regulatory scrutiny of the life and annuity industry, which may lead to higher product costs and negative perceptions about the industry.  In the face of these challenges, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2008:        •    Continue to significantly invest in expanding our distribution in each of our core Individual Markets, Investment Management and Employer Markets businesses;        •    Continue near term product development in our manufacturing units and future product development initiatives in our Retirement Income Security Venture unit related to the evolving retirement income security marketplace;        •    Explore strategies to increase scale in our Employer Markets – Defined Contribution and Investment Management segments;        •    Further embed financial and execution discipline throughout our operations by using technology and making other investments to improve operating effectiveness and lower unit costs; and        •    Substantially complete the remaining platform and system consolidations necessary to achieve the final portion of integration cost saves as well as prepare us for more effective customer interaction in the future.    34    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The MD&A included in our 2007 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the critical accounting policies and estimates provided in our 2007 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2007 Form 10-K.  Adoption of SFAS No. 157 – Fair Value Measurements  We adopted SFAS 157 for all our financial instruments effective January 1, 2008. For detailed discussions of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments and a summary of our financial instruments carried at value as of March 31, 2008, see Notes 2 and 15 of this report and Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 Form 10-K.  The adoption of SFAS 157 decreased income from continuing operations by $16 million. The impact to revenues, benefits and expenses and federal income taxes is excluded from our definition of income from operations and is reported as the initial impact of the adoption of SFAS 157. The subsequent changes in the fair value of the other contract holder funds and associated impacts to DAC, VOBA, DSI, income tax liabilities, revenues and expenses are reported in our Individual Markets – Annuities segment. For a detailed description of the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2.  We did not make any material changes to valuation techniques or models used to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities carried at fair value during the first quarter of 2008, subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 157. As part of our on-going valuation process, we assess the reasonableness of all our valuation techniques or models and make adjustments as necessary.  Our investment securities are valued using market inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. In addition, market indicators and industry and economic events are monitored, and further market data is acquired if certain triggers are met. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used, or some of the inputs described above may not be applicable. For broker-quoted only securities, quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized to be market participants. In order to validate the pricing information and broker/dealer quotes, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions, comparisons with subsequent sales, discussions with senior business leaders and brokers as well as observations of general market movements for those asset classes. It is possible that different valuation techniques and models could produce materially different estimates of fair values.  Our insurance liabilities that contain embedded derivatives are valued based on a stochastic projection of scenarios of the embedded derivative fees, benefits and expenses. The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include capital market assumptions, actuarial lapse, benefit utilization, mortality assumptions, risk margin assumptions, assumptions regarding administrative expenses and a margin for profit. In addition, a non-performance risk component is determined each valuation date that reflects the Company’s own risk of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying liability. The spread for the non-performance risk is added to the discount rates used in determining the fair value from the net cash flows. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.  The adoption of SFAS 157 increased our exposure to earnings volatility from period to period primarily due to the inclusion of the non-performance risk into the calculation of the guaranteed living benefit embedded derivative liability. For additional information, see our discussion in “Individual Markets – Annuities – Benefits” below.  The following summarizes the percentages of our financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis by the SFAS 157 hierarchy levels:                        As of March 31, 2008        Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     TotalFairValue     Assets   0 %   91 %   9 %   100 %   Liabilities   0 %   19 %   81 %   100 %  Note: The percentages above are calculated excluding separate account assets.  Changes of our financial instruments carried at fair value and classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy result from changes     35     in market conditions, as well as changes in our portfolio mix and increases and decreases in fair values as a result of those classifications. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, there were no material changes in financial instruments classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For further detail, see Note 15.  See “Consolidated Investments” below for a summary of our investments in available-for-sale securities backed by pools of residential mortgages.  Derivatives  To protect us from a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products, we use various derivative instruments. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of March 31, 2008, contain industry standard terms and are entered into with financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 Form 10-K.  Guaranteed Living Benefits  We have a hedging strategy designed to mitigate the risk and statement of income volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities associated with the Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage GMWB feature and our i4LIFE® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) feature that is available in our variable annuity products. In the second quarter of 2007, we also began hedging our 4LATER® Advantage GIB feature available in our variable annuity products. These living benefit features are collectively referred to as guaranteed living benefits (“GLBs”). During 2007, we made adjustments to our hedging program to purchase longer dated volatility protection and increased our hedges related to volatility to better match liability sensitivities under SFAS 157. In addition, in early January 2008, we added the variable annuity business in our New York insurance subsidiary, with total account values of approximately $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2008, to our hedge program. In February 2008, we added our new GMWB Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage to our hedging program.  The hedging strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite direction of changes in the value of the embedded derivative of the GMWB and GIB features. This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options on U.S.-based equity indices, futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices and variance swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, as well as interest rate futures and swaps. The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates, and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the fair value of the GMWB and GIB guarantees caused by those same factors. As of March 31, 2008, the embedded derivatives for GMWB, the i4LIFE® Advantage GIB and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB were liabilities valued at $365 million, $104 million and $66 million, respectively.  Impact of our Guaranteed Benefit Features  The following table shows the favorable (unfavorable) earnings impacts of our guaranteed benefit features related to our variable annuity products (in millions):                      For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,             2008     2007     Change   GLB   $ 9     $ 1     NM   GMDB (1)     (4 )     (1 )   NM                        Total   $ 5       —      NM                            (1)  Our reserves related to our guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) are not accounted for as derivatives, and, because of this, the quarterly changes in values for our GMDB reserves and the hedging contracts may not offset each other.  NM - Not Meaningful    36    For additional information on our hedging results, see our discussion in “Individual Markets – Annuities – Benefits” below.  Acquisitions and Dispositions  Dispositions  Media Business  On June 7, 2007, we announced plans to explore strategic options for our former business segment, Lincoln Financial Media. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we decided to divest our television and Charlotte radio broadcasting and sports programming businesses, and, on November 12, 2007, we signed agreements to sell them. The divestiture of the sports programming business closed on November 30, 2007, the Charlotte radio broadcasting business closed on January 31, 2008, and the Television Broadcasting closed on March 31, 2008. Accordingly, we have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income and the assets and liabilities as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. We continue to actively manage our investment in our remaining radio clusters to maximize station performance and future valuation, which are now being reported within Other Operations. For additional information, see Note 3.  The proceeds from the sales of the above media properties were used for repurchase of shares, repayment of debt and other strategic initiatives.  The results of operations of these businesses have been reclassified into income from discontinued operations for all periods presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts (in millions) related to operations of these businesses, included in income from discontinued operations, were as follows:                      For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,             2008     2007   Change     Discontinued Operations Before Disposal                Media revenues, net of agency commissions   $ 22     $ 42   -48 %                       Income from discontinued operations before disposal, before federal income taxes   $ 8     $ 12   -33 %   Federal income taxes     3       4   -25 %                       Income from discontinued operations before disposal     5       8   -38 %                       Disposal                Loss on disposal, before federal income taxes     (12 )     —    NM     Federal income tax benefit     (3 )     —    NM                         Loss on disposal     (9 )     —    NM                         Income (loss) from discontinued operations   $ (4 )   $ 8   NM                        During the first quarter of 2008, we adjusted our loss on disposal of discontinued media properties due primarily to changes in the net assets disposed of for Television Broadcasting.  Fixed Income Investment Management Business  During the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold certain institutional taxable fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company. Investment Management transferred $12.3 billion of assets under management as part of this transaction. Based upon the assets transferred as of October 31, 2007, the purchase price is expected to be no more than $49 million. We expect this transaction to decrease income from operations, compared to the corresponding periods in 2007, by approximately $3 million, after-tax, per quarter in 2008.  During the fourth quarter of 2007, we received $25 million of the purchase price, with additional scheduled payments over the next     37     three years. During 2007, we recorded an after-tax realized loss of $2 million on our Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of goodwill we attributed to this business. There were certain other pipeline accounts in process at the time of the transaction closing, and any adjustment to the purchase price, if necessary, will be determined at October 31, 2008. During the first quarter of 2008, we recorded an after-tax gain of $2 million on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to this transaction.

As of March 31,   Change        2008   2007     Assets Under Management by Advisor               Investment Management:               External assets   $ 69,346   $ 85,164   -19 %   Inter-segment assets     76,531     80,640   -5 %   Lincoln UK     8,079     8,906   -9 %   Policy loans     2,804     2,767   1 %   Assets administered through unaffiliated third parties     67,965     59,523   14 %                     Total assets under management   $ 224,725   $ 237,000   -5 %                    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Net income decreased due primarily to the following:        •    Lower earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund products as a result of declines in assets under management caused by unfavorable equity markets;        •    Higher write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale securities attributable primarily to unfavorable changes in credit quality and increases in credit spreads;        •    Higher benefits due to growth in business in force;        •    Lower net investment income driven by less favorable results from our alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums;        •    The $16 million impact of the initial adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008;    40        •    Higher interest and debt expenses from increased debt;        •    Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due primarily to 401(k) expenses associated with the enhancements made to our employees’ 401(k) plan, effective January 1, 2008; and        •    The first quarter of 2008 adjustment to our loss on disposition of our discontinued operations.  The decrease in net income was partially offset by:        •    Growth in insurance fees driven by increases in life insurance in force as a result of new sales since March 31, 2007 and favorable persistency along with increases in variable account values from positive net flows; and        •    Decrease to benefit expense attributable to the fair value of our embedded derivatives under SFAS 157 being lower than the fair value of the derivatives in our related hedge program.  The foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by segment discussions below. In addition, for a discussion of the earnings impact of the equity markets, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.”  RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL MARKETS  The Individual Markets business provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Life Insurance. Through its Annuities segment, Individual Markets provides tax-deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL.  Individual Markets – Annuities  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Individual Markets – Annuities (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,             2008   2007   Change     Operating Revenues               Insurance premiums   $ 32   $ 13   146 %   Insurance fees     281     236   19 %   Net investment income     150     266   -44 %   Other revenues and fees     87     90   -3 %                     Total operating revenues     550     605   -9 %                     Operating Expenses               Interest credited     83     167   -50 %   Benefits     17     21   -19 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     277     256   8 %                     Total operating expenses     377     444   -15 %                     Income from operations before taxes     173     161   7 %   Federal income taxes     44     40   10 %                     Income from operations   $ 129   $ 121   7 %                    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to a reduction in benefits attributable to our variable annuity business. This reduction was primarily a result of the fair value of our embedded derivatives under SFAS 157 being lower than the fair value of the derivatives in our related hedge program.    41    The increase in income from operations was partially offset by an increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses and a reduction in income from operations due to lower variable account values that were impacted by unfavorable equity markets.  The increase in income from operations is discussed further below.

We charge contract holders with mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and equity markets. Our elective riders for guarantees that we offer, such as GMDB, GMWB and GIB, have additional assessment charges associated with them, which depending on the rider are based on either the account value or the related guarantee amount. Therefore, changes in rider utilization will impact our average assessment rates. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods, to protect us from premature withdrawals.  New deposits are an important component of our effort to grow the annuity business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.  The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. One of the key assumptions in pricing a product is the account persistency, which we refer to as the lapse rate. The lapse rate compares the amount of withdrawals to the retained account values.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The growth in expense assessments was attributable to an increase in average variable annuity account values and an increase in average expense assessment rates driven primarily by the increase in account values with elective variable annuity guarantee riders, such as GMDB, GMWB and GIB, which have incremental expense assessment charges associated with them. The increase in account values reflects cumulative positive net flows, which offset the reduction in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets in the first quarter of 2008.  In the past several years, we have concentrated our efforts on expanding both product and distribution breadth. Annuity deposits increased as a result of continued strong sales of products with guaranteed living benefit riders and the expansion of the wholesaling force in LFD.  Overall lapse rates for the first quarter of 2008 were 8% compared to 10% for the same period in 2007.    43    Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,               2008     2007     Change     Net Investment Income                 Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 227     $ 237     -4 %   Change in call option market value (1)      (97 )     1     NM     Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (2)     1       1     0 %   Alternative investments (3)     —        1     -100 %   Surplus investments (4)     18       24     -25 %   Broker-dealer     1       2     -50 %                         Total net investment income   $ 150     $ 266     -44 %                         Interest Credited                 Amount provided to contract holders   $ 183     $ 184     -1 %   Change in indexed annuity contract liabilities market value (1)     (94 )     (1 )   NM     SFAS 133 forward-starting option (5)     10       4     150 %   Opening balance sheet adjustment (6)     —        (4 )   100 %   DSI deferrals     (26 )     (24 )   -8 %                         Interest credited before DSI amortization     73       159     -54 %   DSI amortization:                 Excluding unlocking     11       9     22 %   Retrospective unlocking     (1 )     (1 )   0 %                         Total interest credited   $ 83     $ 167     -50 %                             (1)  The change in the call option market value in net investment income largely offsets the change in interest credited caused by fluctuations in the value of our indexed annuity contract liabilities.

(3)  See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information.     (4)  Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment.     (5)  SFAS 133/157 requires that we calculate the fair values of index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods, which we refer to as the SFAS 133/157 forward-starting option liability. This liability represents an estimate of the cost of the options we may purchase in the future less expected charges to contract holders, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates. The amount reported in this table represents the change in the fair values of this liability, which results in volatility in interest credited. The interest rate assumption used in discounting this liability within the fair value calculation is the primary driver of the change in value.

For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,      Change        2008   2007       Average invested assets on reserves   $ 15,715   $ 16,501     -5 %   Average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable     17,315     17,839     -3 %   Net flows for fixed annuities, including the fixed portion of variable     575     (67 )   NM    A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management account interest expense, interest on collateral and the change in the call option fair value, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits), less the mark-to-market adjustment on the indexed business, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in the fair value of call options, commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investment income, surplus investment income and SFAS 133/157 forward-starting options can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Profitability of indexed annuities is influenced by the management of derivatives to hedge the index performance of the contracts. These contracts permit the holder to elect an interest rate return or an equity market component, where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S&P 500 Index®. Contract holders may elect to rebalance indexed options at renewal dates, either annually or biannually. At each renewal date, we have the opportunity to re-price the equity-indexed component by establishing caps, spreads and participation rates, subject to guarantees.    45    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was due primarily to the decrease in fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Interest credited provided to contract holders remained relatively flat as a decline in our fixed, including the fixed portion of variable, business was offset by an elevated rate.  Our fixed annuity business includes products with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Account values for these products were $5.2 billion as of March 31, 2008, with 41% already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The average crediting rates for these products were approximately 41 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. In addition to the separate items identified in the interest rate spread table above, the other component of the interest rate credited to contract holders decreased due primarily to a roll-off of multi-year guarantee and annual reset annuities with higher interest rates.  We expect to manage the effect of spreads for near-term operating income through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Benefits   Details underlying benefits (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,      Change        2008     2007       Benefits                 Guaranteed living benefits:                 Change in reserves   $ 256     $ (26 )   NM     Results of hedge program     (289 )     22     NM     Guaranteed death benefits:                 Change in reserves     7       4     75 %   Results of hedge program     (1 )     —      NM     Claims paid     7       2     250 %                         Total guaranteed benefits     (20 )     2     NM     Other (1)     37       19     95 %                         Total benefits   $ 17     $ 21     -19 %                             (1)  Composed primarily of changes in reserves on immediate annuity account values driven by premiums.  We have a hedge program that is designed to mitigate the risk and earnings volatility caused by changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatility associated with the guaranteed benefit features of our variable annuity products, including GMDB, GMWB and GIB riders. Our variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees are considered embedded derivatives and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. In the table above, we have presented the components of our guaranteed benefit results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in benefits was due primarily to the impact of our guaranteed benefit hedge program exceeding the change in reserves and costs, partially offset by an increase in benefits attributable to single premium immediate annuities, which had a corresponding increase in insurance premiums.    46    The adoption of SFAS 157 resulted in a fair value of the embedded derivative that was lower than the fair value of the derivative instruments. This created an over-hedged position, driving a decline in our guaranteed living benefits for the first quarter of 2008. For a discussion of this fair value determination under SFAS 157, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above.

We have certain trail commissions that are based upon account values that are expensed as incurred rather than being deferred and amortized.  Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. These expenses are more than offset by increases to other income.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in expenses incurred, excluding broker-dealer, and DAC and VOBA amortization, excluding unlocking, was attributable primarily to growth in account values from sales.  The increase in broker-dealer general and administrative expenses was attributable primarily to increases in personnel costs.    47    Individual Markets – Life Insurance  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Individual Markets – Life Insurance (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,             2008   2007   Change     Operating Revenues               Insurance premiums   $ 86   $ 88   -2 %   Insurance fees     445     419   6 %   Net investment income     447     454   -2 %   Other revenues and fees     9     10   -10 %                     Total operating revenues     987     971   2 %                     Operating Expenses               Interest credited     258     252   2 %   Benefits     296     246   20 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     213     221   -4 %                     Total operating expenses     767     719   7 %                     Income from operations before taxes     220     252   -13 %   Federal income taxes     75     85   -12 %                     Income from operations   $ 145   $ 167   -13 %                    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:        •    Higher benefits due to higher mortality and lower benefits in the first quarter of 2007 partially related to a $14 million reduction in benefits related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot;        •    Lower net investment income due to reductions in invested assets caused by a reduction in statutory reserves related to results of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries and certain assumption changes in the fourth quarter of 2007 and less favorable results from our alternative investment income and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums; and        •    A decrease attributable to unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC and VOBA for the first quarter of 2008 compared to favorable retrospective unlocking for the first quarter of 2007.  The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:        •    Growth in insurance fees driven by an increase in business in force as a result of new sales since March 31, 2007, and favorable persistency, partially offset by the impact on insurance fees from lower sales in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007 and adjustments during the second quarter of 2007 resulting from adjusting account values for certain of our life insurance policies and modifying the accounting for certain of our life insurance policies.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.  Insurance Premiums  Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Traditional in-force face amount and thus premiums remained relatively flat.    48    Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,      Change        2008     2007       Insurance Fees                 Mortality assessments   $ 313     $ 292     7 %   Expense assessments     164       154     6 %   Surrender charges     16       15     7 %   DFEL:                 Deferrals     (88 )     (66 )   -33 %   Amortization, excluding unlocking     36       27     33 %   Retrospective unlocking     4       (3 )   233 %                         Total insurance fees   $ 445     $ 419     6 %                                             For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,      Change        2008     2007       Sales by Product                 UL:                 Excluding MoneyGuard ®   $ 114     $ 166     -31 %   MoneyGuard ®     11       7     57 %                         Total UL     125       173     -28 %   VUL     15       21     -29 %   Term/whole life     5       9     -44 %                         Total sales   $ 145     $ 203     -29 %                         Net Flows                 Deposits   $ 966     $ 1,039     -7 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (387 )     (341 )   -13 %                         Net flows   $ 579     $ 698     -17 %                         Contract holder assessments   $ 643     $ 601     7 %                                           As of March 31,   Change        2008   2007     Account Values               UL   $ 21,079   $ 19,982   5 %   VUL     4,526     4,696   -4 %   Interest-sensitive whole life     2,276     2,246   1 %                     Total account values   $ 27,881   $ 26,924   4 %                     In-Force Face Amount               UL and other   $ 286,187   $ 272,920   5 %   Term insurance     234,860     235,491   0 %                     Total in-force face amount   $ 521,047   $ 508,411   2 %                    Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’     49     account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.  Sales in the table above and as discussed below were reported as follows:         •    UL, VUL, MoneyGuard®—100% of annualized expected target premiums plus 5% of paid excess premiums, including an adjustment for internal replacements at approximately 50% of target; and        •    Whole life and term—100% of first year paid premiums.  Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability.  We have screening procedures to identify sales that we believe have characteristics associated with investor-owned life insurance in order to prevent policies with these characteristics from being issued. However, accurate identification of these policies can be difficult, and we continue to modify our screening procedures. We believe that our sales of UL products include some sales with investor-owned life insurance characteristics. We expect no significant impact to our profitability; however, returns on UL business sold as part of investor-owned designs are believed to be lower than traditional estate planning UL sales due in part to no expected lapses.  UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 32% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of March 31, 2008, and approximately 76% of sales for the first quarter of 2008. Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”) imposes additional statutory reserve requirements for these products. See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” for further information on the manner in which we reinsure our AG38 reserves.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The growth in mortality and expense assessments was attributable to increased business in force. Life insurance in force and account values grew as a result of new sales since March 31, 2007, and favorable persistency. In addition, insurance fees for the first quarter of 2007 were reduced by $5 million related primarily to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot.  The first quarter of 2008 had favorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DFEL amortization) due primarily to unfavorable excess investment income, unfavorable mortality on permanent products and model adjustments on certain life insurance policies.  The first quarter of 2007 had unfavorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DFEL amortization) due primarily to favorable persistency, higher excess investment income and lower maintenance expenses.

Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are also affected by various reserve adjustments, primarily the result of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries, the modification of accounting for certain of our life insurance policies, and by capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets for other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and alternative investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.    51    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was due partially to continued growth of business in force, partially offset by the impact of reductions in statutory reserves. The decrease in alternative investment income was driven primarily by unfavorable results from limited partnership investments. Higher AG38 statutory reserve liabilities on UL policies with secondary guarantees contributed to invested asset growth. At June 30, 2007, we reduced statutory reserves related to our secondary guarantee UL products by approximately $150 million, which has reduced the amount of net investment income allocated to this segment by $2 million per quarter. This statutory reserve reduction related to modifying the accounting for certain of our life insurance policies. In October 2007, we released approximately $300 million of capital that had previously supported our UL products with secondary guarantees as a result of executing on a capital transaction to provide AG38 relief. This release of capital lowered the level of assets supporting this business and has reduced net investment income by approximately $5 million per quarter. As of December 31, 2007, we reduced statutory reserves related primarily to legal entity consolidation by $344 million, which has reduced the amount of net investment income allocated to this segment by approximately $5 million in the first quarter of 2008. This reduction in statutory reserves was primarily a result of the merger of several of our insurance subsidiaries.  The increase in interest credited was attributable primarily to growth in UL account values of 5%. On June 1, 2007, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads approximately 5 basis points. On June 1, 2008, we expect to implement a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which is expected to increase spreads approximately 5 basis points.  For the first quarter of 2008, the portfolio rates exceeded new money rates by roughly 19 basis points. For the first quarter of 2007, the portfolio rates exceeded new money rates by roughly 25 basis points. As of March 31, 2008, 53% of interest-sensitive account values have crediting rates at contract guaranteed levels, and 36% have crediting rates within 50 basis points of contractual guarantees. Going forward, we expect to be able to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Benefits  Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,               2008     2007     Change     Benefits                 Death claims direct and assumed   $ 546     $ 484     13 %   Death claims ceded     (238 )     (189 )   -26 %   Reserves released on death     (98 )     (92 )   -7 %                         Net death benefits     210       203     3 %   Change in reserves for products with secondary guarantees     26       —      NM     Other benefits (1)     60       43     40 %                         Total benefits   $ 296     $ 246     20 %                         Death claims per $1,000 of inforce     1.49       1.48     1 %       (1)  Other benefits include primarily traditional product changes in reserves and dividends.    52    Benefits for this segment include death claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in reserves for our products with secondary guarantees. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of claims and assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in benefits was due primarily to growth in business in force, higher mortality and an increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees, partially offset by $14 million in the first quarter of 2007 related to a purchase accounting adjustment to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot.  An adjustment to account values and modification of accounting related to certain life insurance policies in the second quarter of 2007 increased reserves for products with secondary guarantees. In the third quarter of 2007, we had an unfavorable prospective unlocking that also resulted in an increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees. As a result of these changes, we expect an increase in reserves of approximately $4 million in future quarters.  Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,      Change        2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                 Commissions   $ 183     $ 227     -19 %   General and administration expenses     103       110     -6 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     29       33     -12 %                         Total expenses incurred     315       370     -15 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (234 )     (289 )   19 %                         Total expenses recognized before amortization     81       81     0 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                 Retrospective unlocking     10       (12 )   183 %   Other amortization     121       151     -20 %   Other intangible amortization     1       1     0 %                         Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 213     $ 221     -4 %                         DAC and VOBA deferrals                 As a percentage of sales     161.4 %     142.4 %      Commissions and other general and administrative expenses that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are generally amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in expenses incurred was primarily a result of lower sales. The decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization, excluding unlocking, was due partially to unfavorable gross margins primarily from unfavorable investment results. In addition, DAC and VOBA amortization increased by $10 million related to adjustments to the opening balance sheet of Jefferson-Pilot finalized in the first quarter of 2007.  The first quarter of 2008 unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) was due primarily to unfavorable excess investment income, unfavorable mortality on permanent products, and model adjustments on certain life insurance policies.    53    The first quarter of 2007 favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) was due primarily to favorable persistency, higher excess investment income and lower maintenance expenses.  RESULTS OF EMPLOYER MARKETS   The Employer Markets business provides its products through two segments: Retirement Products and Group Protection. The Retirement Products segment operates through two lines of business – Defined Contribution, which provides employer-sponsored variable and fixed annuities, and mutual-fund based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 marketplaces, and Executive Benefits, which provides corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) and bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”). Our Institutional Pension business, which was previously reported as part of the Retirement Products segment, is now being reported in Other Operations. The Group Protection segment of Employer Markets offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by growth in insurance fees driven by increases in account values from positive net flows; however, a substantial increase in new deposit production is necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.    55    Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, account values and net flows (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Insurance Fees               Annuity expense assessments   $ 55   $ 56   -2 %   Mutual fund fees     4     4   0 %                     Total expense assessments     59     60   -2 %   Surrender charges     2     2   0 %                     Total insurance fees   $ 61   $ 62   -2 %                     Average Daily Variable Account Values   $ 16,640   $ 17,582   -5 %                     Average Daily S&P 500 Index®     1,349.16     1,424.78   -5 %                                       As of March 31,   Change        2008   2007     Account Values               Variable portion of variable annuities   $ 16,292   $ 17,676   -8 %   Fixed portion of variable annuities     6,051     6,122   -1 %                     Total variable annuities     22,343     23,798   -6 %                     Fixed annuities     5,166     4,870   6 %                     Total annuities     27,509     28,668   -4 %   Mutual funds     7,254     5,807   25 %                     Total annuities and mutual funds   $ 34,763   $ 34,475   1 %                      56                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,               2008     2007     Change     Account Value Roll Forward – By Product                 Total Micro – Small Segment:                 Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 7,798     $ 7,535     3 %   Gross deposits     499       460     8 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (570 )     (451 )   -26 %                         Net flows     (71 )     9     NM     Transfers between fixed and variable accounts     (12 )     (5 )   NM     Investment increase and change in market value     (497 )     150     NM                           Balance at end-of-period   $ 7,218     $ 7,689     -6 %                         Total Mid – Large Segment:                 Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 9,463     $ 6,975     36 %   Gross deposits     769       711     8 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (159 )     (118 )   -35 %                         Net flows     610       593     3 %   Transfers between fixed and variable accounts     (29 )     2     NM     Investment increase and change in market value     (423 )     164     NM                           Balance at end-of-period   $ 9,621     $ 7,734     24 %                         Total Multi-Fund ® and Other Variable Annuities: (1)                 Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 18,797     $ 19,146     -2 %   Gross deposits     284       316     -10 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (542 )     (697 )   22 %                         Net flows     (258 )     (381 )   32 %   Transfers between fixed and variable accounts     (1 )     (4 )   75 %   Inter-segment transfer     294       —      NM     Investment increase and change in market value     (908 )     291     NM                           Balance at end-of-period   $ 17,924     $ 19,052     -6 %                         Total Annuities and Mutual Funds:                 Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 36,058     $ 33,656     7 %   Gross deposits     1,552       1,487     4 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (1,271 )     (1,266 )   0 %                         Net flows     281       221     27 %   Transfers between fixed and variable accounts     (42 )     (7 )   NM     Inter-segment transfer     294       —      NM     Investment increase and change in market value     (1,828 )     605     NM                           Balance at end-of-period (2)   $ 34,763     $ 34,474     1 %                             (1)  This is our oldest block of annuity business and the return on assets is more than two times that of new deposits.

Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.  New deposits are an important component of our effort to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of our business as demonstrated by our lapse rates.  We serve the mid-large case 401(k) and 403(b) markets with our mutual fund programs. Our programs bundle our fixed annuity products with mutual funds, along with record keeping and employee education components. The amounts associated with the mutual fund programs are not included in the assets or liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The distribution model for the micro-small case 401(k) market is focused on driving growth through financial intermediaries. As of March 31, 2008, we had 71 wholesalers in place to support this business and intend to add an additional 18 wholesalers throughout the remainder of 2008. We are beginning to experience an increase in new business activity as a result of building our own wholesaling force for this market.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in expense assessments was driven by lower average daily variable annuity account values due to unfavorable equity markets.  Deposits in our mid-large segment (including mutual fund program fixed annuity deposits) increased due to an increase in the number of mutual fund program accounts, which resulted in both an increase in initial deposits and an increase in ongoing periodic deposits.    58    The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 16% for the first quarter of 2008 compared to 15% for the same period in 2007. The return on assets, calculated as income divided by average assets under management, for Multi-Fund®  and Other Variable Annuities, our oldest block of annuity business, is more than two times that of new deposits. Therefore, a substantial increase in new deposit production is necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.  As of March 31, 2008, approximately $13.3 billion, or 60%, of variable annuity contract account values contained a return of premium death benefit feature, and the net amount at risk related to these contracts was $24 million. The remaining variable annuity contract account values contain no GMDB feature.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed product line and what we credit to our fixed contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuities. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited less amortization related to DSI, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuities. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investment income and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  While fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income was relatively flat, the yield declined due to lower reinvestment rates, which was offset by the increase in average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable driven by transfers from variable annuities. In response to the competitive environment, we reduced crediting rates by 10 basis points and reduced new money rates by 25 basis points for Multi-Fund® and mutual fund products. We are currently evaluating further crediting rate actions, with the expectation of maintaining stable spreads over the near term, excluding the effects of prepayment and makewhole premiums.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”    60    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                 Commissions   $ 20     $ 19     5 %   General and administration expenses     52       50     4 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     4       5     -20 %                         Total expenses incurred     76       74     3 %   DAC deferrals     (24 )     (22 )   -9 %                         Total expenses recognized before amortization     52       52     0 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                 Retrospective unlocking     3       —      NM     Other amortization     21       20     5 %                         Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 76     $ 72     6 %                         DAC deferrals                 As a percentage of sales/deposits     1.5 %     1.5 %      Commissions and other costs, that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business, excluding those associated with our mutual fund products, are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are not deferred and amortized, as is the case for our insurance products.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in expenses incurred was due primarily to growth in business in force, partially offset by DAC deferrals. The increase in retrospective DAC unlocking for the three months ended March 31, 2008, was primarily attributable to higher lapses than were estimated in our DAC models.    61    Retirement Products – Executive Benefits  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Retirement Products – Executive Benefits (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Operating Revenues               Insurance fees   $ 14   $ 13   8 %   Net investment income     52     56   -7 %                     Total operating revenues     66     69   -4 %                     Operating Expenses               Interest credited     38     38   0 %   Benefits     3     3   0 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     7     10   -30 %                     Total operating expenses     48     51   -6 %                     Income from operations before taxes     18     18   0 %   Federal income taxes     6     6   0 %                     Income from operations   $ 12   $ 12   0 %                    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations remained flat as lower net investment income driven by less favorable results from our alternative investment income and lower earnings on surplus were offset by lower DAC and VOBA amortization expense due to unfavorable retrospective unlocking in 2007.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.  Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in force (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Insurance Fees                 Mortality assessments   $ 9     $ 9     0 %   Expense assessments     7       4     75 %   DFEL:                 Deferrals     (2 )     (1 )   -100 %   Amortization     —        1     -100 %                         Total insurance fees   $ 14     $ 13     8 %                          62                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       COLI and BOLI - Sales   $ 28     $ 20     40 %                         COLI and BOLI - Account Values                 Balance at beginning-of-year   $ 4,436     $ 4,305     3 %   Deposits (1)     165       65     154 %   Withdrawals and deaths (1)     (94 )     (140 )   33 %                         Net flows     71       (75 )   195 %   Policyholder assessments     (20 )     (18 )   -11 %   Interest credited and change in market value     (27 )     52     NM                           Balance at end-of-year   $ 4,460     $ 4,264     5 %                         COLI and BOLI - In Force   $ 15,826     $ 14,747     7 %                             (1)  Deposits and withdrawals and deaths each include $44 million related to the exchange of legacy Jefferson-Pilot products with new Lincoln products in the first quarter of 2008.  Our mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values and reported as insurance fees. For this business, the mortality and expense assessments amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and face amount of our insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.  Included in the business acquired with the Jefferson-Pilot companies are BOLI products, which accounted for $1.7 billion in contract holder fund balances as of March 31, 2008. VOBA balances, net of unearned revenue reserves, related to these blocks were approximately $115 million as of March 31, 2008. These contracts, which are generally not subject to surrender charges, are owned by several thousand contract holders. These contracts were primarily originated through, and continue to be serviced by, two marketing organizations. The surrender rate for this product may increase beyond current experience due to the absence of surrender charges and rising interest rates that may result in returns available to contract holders on competitors’ products being more attractive than on our policies in force. The following factors may influence contract holders to continue these coverages: our ability to adjust crediting rates; relatively high minimum rate guarantees; the difficulty of re-underwriting existing and additional covered lives; and unfavorable tax attributes of certain surrenders. Our assumptions for amortizing VOBA and unearned revenue for these policies reflect a higher long-term expected lapse rate than other blocks of business due to the factors noted above. Lapse experience for this block in a particular period could vary significantly from our long-term lapse assumptions.  Consistent with the way we report UL sales, we report COLI and BOLI sales as 100% of annualized expected target premium plus 5% of paid excess premium, including an adjustment for internal replacements at approximately 50% of target. Sales in this business tend to be of large case nature and can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Mortality and expense assessments for this business were favorably impacted by higher variable fees resulting from a customer transferring $55 million of fixed account value to variable account value in the second quarter of 2007 partially offset by declines in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets. Expense assessments are also increasing as client deposits are primarily into variable products.    63    Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  Details underlying net investment income and interest credited (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Net Investment Income               Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 51   $ 54   -6 %   Surplus investments (1)     1     2   -50 %                     Total net investment income   $ 52   $ 56   -7 %                     Interest Credited   $ 38   $ 38   0 %                         (1)  Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment.  When analyzing the impact of net investment income for this segment, it is important to understand that a portion of the investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed products, including the fixed portion of variable. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed product line and what we credit to our fixed contract holders’ accounts.  Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investment income and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other net investment income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of a customer transferring $55 million from fixed accounts to variable accounts in the second quarter of 2007, reducing the interest margin, and higher consent fees in 2007. Additionally, earnings on surplus investments were negatively impacted by unfavorable equity markets.  On January 1, 2008, we implemented a 25 basis point increase in crediting rates on a small block of policies that have approximately $150 million of fixed account value. This increase in interest credited partially offset the impact of a customer transferring $55 million from fixed accounts to variable accounts in the second quarter of 2007.  Benefits  Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated account balance for its interest-sensitive products.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Benefits remained flat despite growth in business in force due to favorable mortality. Additionally, benefits were favorably impacted by a recovery on a reinsurance agreement in 2007.    64    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                 Commissions   $ 12     $ 6     100 %   General and administration expenses     3       2     50 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     2       1     100 %                         Total expenses incurred     17       9     89 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (12 )     (7 )   -71 %                         Total expenses recognized before amortization     5       2     150 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                 Retrospective unlocking     (1 )     3     NM     Other amortization     3       5     -40 %                         Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 7     $ 10     -30 %                         DAC and VOBA deferrals                 As a percentage of sales     42.9 %     35.0 %      Commissions and other costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and, for our interest-sensitive products, are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in expenses incurred was primarily a result of increased sales.  The favorable retrospective unlocking (decrease to DAC and VOBA amortization) in the first quarter of 2008 was due primarily to favorable persistency and mortality. The unfavorable retrospective unlocking (increase to DAC and VOBA amortization) in the first quarter of 2007 was due to higher than expected surrender activity. The surrender activity occurred for a variety of reasons, and no systemic issues, such as service or product competitiveness, contributed to this surrender activity.    65    Employer Markets – Group Protection  The Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers. The segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system of regional group offices. These offices develop business through employee benefit brokers, third-party administrators and other employee benefit firms.

The increase in income from operations was partially offset by an increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due to growth in our business in force, higher 401(k) expenses, elevated costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives and an increase in the allocation of expenses to this segment.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.    66    Insurance Premiums  Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Insurance Premiums by Product Line               Life   $ 133   $ 119   12 %   Disability     162     145   12 %   Dental     37     33   12 %                     Total non-medical     332     297   12 %   Medical     38     35   9 %                     Total insurance premiums   $ 370   $ 332   11 %                     Sales   $ 54   $ 61   -11 %                    Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.  Sales in the table above and as discussed below are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products. Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. The trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in insurance premiums in our non-medical business reflects normal business growth.  Net Investment Income  We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which is a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Net investment income remained flat as continued growth of business in force was offset by lower yields on required statutory surplus due to weaker results from our alternative investments.    67    Benefits  Details underlying benefits (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Benefits by Product Line                 Life   $ 95     $ 89     7 %   Disability     111       101     10 %   Dental     30       26     15 %                         Total non-medical     236       216     9 %   Medical     33       31     6 %                         Total benefits   $ 269     $ 247     9 %                         Loss Ratios by Product Line                 Life     71.9 %     75.0 %       Disability     68.1 %     69.5 %       Dental     80.8 %     79.2 %       Total non-medical     71.0 %     72.7 %       Medical     87.6 %     88.6 %          Note: Loss ratios presented above are calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.  Management has chosen to focus on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We believe that loss ratios in the 71-74% range are more representative of longer-term expectations for the composite non-medical portion of this segment. We expect normal fluctuations in this range, as claim experience is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that experience will fall inside this expected range.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  We experienced favorable claim experience on all of our non-medical and medical products, except for dental. Our improved total non-medical loss ratio was driven by exceptional life and disability results. Our life loss ratio benefited from favorable waiver claims experience. Our disability loss ratio has benefited from favorable termination and incidence experience.    68    Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                 Commissions   $ 44     $ 39     13 %   General and administration expenses     42       32     31 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     10       10     0 %                         Total expenses incurred     96       81     19 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (14 )     (11 )   -27 %                         Total expenses recognized before amortization     82       70     17 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest     8       8     0 %                         Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 90     $ 78     15 %                         DAC and VOBA deferrals                 As a percentage of insurance premiums     3.8 %     3.3 %      Expenses, excluding commissions, that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business. Commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses was in line with the increase in insurance premiums. Additionally, higher 401(k) expenses, elevated costs associated with investments in strategic initiatives and an increase in the allocation of expenses to this segment also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses. Partially offsetting the increase in expenses were higher deferrals, driven by strategic sales expenses.    69    RESULTS OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT  The Investment Management segment, through Delaware Investments, provides a broad range of managed account portfolios, mutual funds, sub-advised funds and other investment products to individual investors and to institutional investors such as private and public pension funds, foundations and endowment funds. Delaware Investments is the marketing name for Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Investment Management (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Operating Revenues                 Investment advisory fees – external   $ 76     $ 90     -16 %   Investment advisory fees – inter-segment     20       25     -20 %   Other revenues and fees     24       35     -31 %                         Total operating revenues     120       150     -20 %                         Operating Expenses                 Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     101       125     -19 %                         Income from operations before taxes     19       25     -24 %   Federal income taxes     7       9     -22 %                         Income from operations   $ 12     $ 16     -25 %                         Pre-tax operating margin (1)     16 %     17 %                                 (1)  The pre-tax operating margin is determined by dividing pre-tax income from operations by operating revenues.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations decreased due primarily to the following:        •    Lower investment advisory fees – external due to lower third-party assets under management driven by less favorable equity markets and the sale of certain fixed income business; and        •    Negative returns on seed capital driven by the unfavorable equity markets in the first quarter of 2008.  The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from:        •    The transfer of assets to an internal advisor within Employer Markets; and        •    The transfer of assets to an unaffiliated investment management company.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.    70    Investment Advisory Fees  Details underlying assets under management and net flows (in millions) were as follows:                       As of March 31,     Change         2008     2007       Assets Under Management                 Retail – equity   $ 27,409     $ 32,362     -15 %   Retail – fixed     11,238       9,380     20 %                         Total retail     38,647       41,742     -7 %                         Institutional – equity     19,512       20,943     -7 %   Institutional – fixed     11,187       22,479     -50 %                         Total institutional     30,699       43,422     -29 %                         Inter-segment assets – separate account     9,191       12,982     -29 %   Inter-segment assets – general account     67,340       67,658     0 %                         Total inter-segment assets     76,531       80,640     -5 %                         Total assets under management   $ 145,877     $ 165,804     -12 %                              Total Sub-Advised Assets, Included Above                 Retail   $ 14,212     $ 18,466     -23 %   Institutional     4,071       4,645     -12 %                         Total sub-advised assets   $ 18,283     $ 23,111     -21 %                                For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Net Flows – External (1)                 Retail equity sales   $ 1,493     $ 2,120     -30 %   Retail equity redemptions and transfers     (2,615 )     (2,143 )   -22 %                         Retail equity net flows     (1,122 )     (23 )   NM                           Retail fixed income sales     1,376       1,093     26 %   Retail fixed income redemptions and transfers     (978 )     (652 )   -50 %                         Retail fixed income net flows     398       441     -10 %                         Total retail sales     2,869       3,213     -11 %   Total retail redemptions and transfers     (3,593 )     (2,795 )   -29 %                         Total retail net flows     (724 )     418     NM                           Institutional equity inflows     968       818     18 %   Institutional equity withdrawals and transfers     (1,043 )     (2,156 )   52 %                         Institutional equity net flows     (75 )     (1,338 )   94 %                         Institutional fixed income inflows     168       1,502     -89 %   Institutional fixed income withdrawals and transfers     (574 )     (437 )   -31 %                         Institutional fixed income net flows     (406 )     1,065     NM                           Total institutional inflows     1,136       2,320     -51 %   Total institutional redemptions and transfers     (1,617 )     (2,593 )   38 %                         Total institutional net flows     (481 )     (273 )   -76 %                         Total sales/inflows     4,005       5,533     -28 %   Total redemptions and transfers     (5,210 )     (5,388 )   3 %                         Total net flows   $ (1,205 )   $ 145     NM                               (1)  Includes Delaware Variable Insurance Product (“VIP”) funds.

The table above excludes the transfer of $780 million in assets to Other Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2007, because we do not consider these to be net flows.                   For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Average daily S&P 500 Index®   1,349.16   1,424.78   -5 %                Investment advisory fees are generally a function of the rates priced into the product and our average assets under management, which is driven by net flows and equity markets. Investment advisory fees – external include amounts that are ultimately paid to sub-advisors for managing the sub-advised assets. The amounts paid to sub-advisors are generally included in the segment’s expenses.  Investment advisory fees – inter-segment consists of fees for asset management services this segment provides to Individual Markets and Employer Markets for managing general account assets supporting fixed income products and surplus and separate account assets. These inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income as they are eliminated along with the associated expenses incurred by Individual Markets and Employer Markets. Individual Markets and Employer Markets reports the cost as a reduction to net investment income, which is the same methodology that would be used if these services were provided by an external party.  The level of net flows may vary considerably from period to period, and therefore results in one period are not indicative of net flows in subsequent periods.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Investment advisory fees – external decreased due primarily to lower third-party average assets under management as a result of less favorable equity market returns, a decrease in net flows and lower advisory revenues as a result of the fixed income transaction, as discussed below. Market value changes on assets under management in the first quarter of 2008 were $(3.0) billion in retail and $(2.1) billion in institutional compared to $0.8 billion in retail and $0.6 billion in institutional for the same period in 2007.  Net flows decreased due to the closing of several products and the variability of institutional sales. In addition, we believe sales slowed during the first quarter of 2008 as a result of the fixed income transaction discussed below. While we expect investment performance to remain solid in the remainder of 2008, capacity constraints in certain investment strategies and the fixed income transaction, as discussed below, may limit sales growth.  On October 31, 2007, we sold certain institutional taxable fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company. As a result of this transaction, assets under management decreased by $12.3 billion which resulted in a $4 million decrease to investment advisory fees – external in the first quarter of 2008.  Investment advisory fees – inter-segment decreased due to a decline in total inter-segment assets under management, primarily related to the transition of the investment advisory role for the Lincoln Variable Insurance Trust product effective May 1, 2007, to Employer Markets. In the role of investment advisor, Investment Management provided investment performance and compliance     72     oversight on third-party investment managers in exchange for a fee. Investment Management will continue to manage certain of the assets as a sub-advisor. As a result of this change, Investment Management’s assets under management decreased by $3.2 billion, however, there was no impact to our consolidated assets under management or consolidated net income.  Other Revenues and Fees  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Other revenues and fees decreased due primarily to a $6 million decrease in the return on seed capital due to unfavorable equity markets. Seed capital investments are important to establishing a track record for products that will later be sold to investors.  Operating Expenses  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Operating expenses decreased due primarily to the elimination of certain expenses as a result of transferring the investment advisory role of Lincoln Variable Insurance Trust to another internal advisor, selling certain fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company and transitioning the investment accounting function to a third party, as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by expenses that vary with the levels of assets and revenues.  RESULTS OF LINCOLN UK  Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood, Gloucester, England, and is licensed to do business throughout the United Kingdom. Lincoln UK primarily focuses on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base. The segment accepts new deposits from existing relationships and markets a limited range of new products including retirement income solutions. Lincoln UK’s product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products, where the risk associated with the underlying investments is borne by the contract holders. The segment is sensitive to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling. A significant increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have a significant adverse effect on the segment’s operating results.    73    Income from Operations  Details underlying the results for Lincoln UK (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Operating Revenues               Insurance premiums   $ 19   $ 24   -21 %   Insurance fees     46     47   -2 %   Net investment income     21     20   5 %                     Total operating revenues     86     91   -5 %                     Operating Expenses               Benefits     31     36   -14 %   Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses     38     38   0 %                     Total operating expenses     69     74   -7 %                     Income from operations before taxes     17     17   0 %   Federal income taxes     6     6   0 %                     Income from operations   $ 11   $ 11   0 %                     Exchange Rate Ratio-U.S. Dollars to Pounds Sterling               Average for the period     1.987     1.964   1 %   End-of-period     1.985     1.968   1 %  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Income from operations remained flat as decreases in revenues were offset by decreases in expenses.  The decreases in revenues and expenses are discussed further below.  Insurance Premiums  Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, insurance premiums are primarily a function of the rates priced into the product and face amount of our insurance in force.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, insurance premiums decreased 22%, primarily reflecting a $4 million decrease in the annuitization of vesting pension policies, due to variability in the rate at which pension policies vest resulting from policyholder options. The decrease in the amount of premiums received resulted in a corresponding decrease in benefits. Our annualized policy lapse rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 6.3% as compared to 6.7% for the corresponding period in 2007, as measured by the number of policies in force.    74    Insurance Fees  Details underlying insurance fees, business in force and unit-linked assets (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Insurance Fees                 Mortality assessments   $ 9     $ 10     -10 %   Expense assessments     30       31     -3 %   DFEL:                 Deferrals     (1 )     (1 )   0 %   Amortization, excluding unlocking     7       6     17 %   Retrospective unlocking     1       1     0 %                         Total insurance fees   $ 46     $ 47     -2 %                                For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Individual life insurance in force   $ 18,283     $ 19,307     -5 %          For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Unit-Linked Assets                 Balance at beginning-of-period   $ 8,850     $ 8,757     1 %   Deposits     60       68     -12 %   Withdrawals and deaths     (213 )     (240 )   11 %                         Net flows     (153 )     (172 )   11 %   Investment income and change in market value     (608 )     277     NM     Foreign currency adjustment     (10 )     44     NM                           Balance at end-of-period   $ 8,079     $ 8,906     -9 %                        The insurance fees reflect mortality and expense assessments on unit-linked account values to cover insurance and administrative charges. These assessments, excluding the effect of the exchange rate, are primarily a function of the rates priced into the product, the face amount of insurance in force and the average unit-linked assets, which is driven by net flows on the account values and the financial markets. Although the use of the reversion to the mean process has lessened the impact of short-term volatility in equity markets, the segment’s fee income remains subject to volatility in the equity markets as it affects the level of the underlying assets that drive the fee income.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Excluding the effects of exchange rates and unlocking, insurance fees decreased 3%, due primarily to lower average unit-linked account values resulting largely from less favorable equity markets, as the average Financial Times Stock Exchange (“FTSE”) 100 index was 6% lower, and a $1 million decrease in linked-taxes deducted from unit-linked funds due to decreasing bond values.  Net Investment Income  We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which is a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.    75    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Excluding the effects of exchange rates, net investment income remained relatively flat.  Benefits  Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated account balance for its unit-linked products. Benefits are recognized when incurred.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Excluding the effect of the exchange rate, benefits were 15% lower, reflecting a $3 million decrease due to lower levels of vested annuity premiums and a $1 million decrease related to lower Guaranteed Annuity Option (“GAO”) reserves. The decrease in GAO reserves is offset by lower linked-taxes on the unit-linked funds mentioned above.  Lincoln UK maintains reserves originally established in 1997 and 1999 for mis-selling activities. On an ongoing basis, Lincoln UK evaluates various assumptions underlying these estimated liabilities, including the expected levels of future complaints and the potential implications with respect to the adequacy of the aggregate liability associated with U.K. selling practice matters. Future changes in complaint levels could affect Lincoln UK’s ultimate exposure to mis-selling issues, although we believe that any future change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position.  Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses  Details underlying underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Underwriting, Acquisition, Insurance and Other Expenses                 Commissions   $ 1     $ 1     0 %   General and administration expenses     27       27     0 %                         Total expenses incurred     28       28     0 %   DAC and VOBA deferrals     (1 )     (1 )   0 %                         Total expenses recognized before amortization     27       27     0 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                 Retrospective unlocking     (1 )     (1 )   0 %   Other amortization, net of interest     12       12     0 %                         Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses   $ 38     $ 38     0 %                        Commissions and other costs, which vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business, are deferred to the extent recoverable and for our interest-sensitive products are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts depending on the block of business.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Total underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses remained flat.  RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS  Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries, investments in media properties and other corporate investments, benefit plan net assets, the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance, which was sold to Swiss Re in 2001, corporate debt and corporate reinsurance. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value. Other Operations also includes the Institutional Pension business which was     76     previously reported in Employer Markets – Retirement Products. The Institutional Pension business is a closed-block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off.  Loss from Operations  Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Operating Revenues                 Insurance premiums   $ 1     $ 3     -67 %   Net investment income     99       86     15 %   Amortization of deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance     18       19     -5 %   Media revenues (net)     22       25     -12 %   Other revenues and fees     (2 )     —      NM     Inter-segment elimination of investment advisory fees     (20 )     (25 )   20 %                         Total operating revenues     118       108     9 %                         Operating Expenses                 Interest credited     45       44     2 %   Benefits     28       36     -22 %   Media expenses     16       15     7 %   Other expenses     36       25     44 %   Interest and debt expenses     76       61     25 %   Inter-segment elimination of investment advisory fees     (20 )     (25 )   20 %                         Total operating expenses     181       156     16 %                         Loss from operations before taxes     (63 )     (48 )   -31 %   Federal income taxes     (21 )     (19 )   -11 %                         Loss from operations   $ (42 )   $ (29 )   -45 %                        Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  Loss from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:        •    Higher interest and debt expenses from increased debt;        •    Higher other expenses primarily attributable to relocation costs associated with the move of our corporate office and increased facilities costs;        •    Lower effective tax rate as increased losses did not have a proportionate increase in permanent differences between GAAP and income tax basis adjustments; and        •    Lower media earnings related to softening market conditions.  The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by the following:        •    Higher net investment income from an increase in invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt as these items exceeded share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders; and        •    Favorable mortality in our Institutional Pension business.  The foregoing items are discussed further below.    77    Net Investment Income and Interest Credited  We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital allocated to Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition –  Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” the holding company maintains an inter-segment cash management account where other segments can borrow from or lend money to the holding company. The inter-segment cash management account impacts net investment income for Other Operations as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.  The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in net investment income was driven by an increase in invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt. These items exceeded the amount of share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders. Also, a decrease in our inter-segment cash management account favorably impacted net investment income.  In the first quarter of 2008, we had write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments, which decreased the recorded value of our invested assets. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the operating segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities.  Benefits  Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The decrease in benefits was a result of favorable mortality in our Institutional Pension business.  Other Expenses  Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008   2007     Other Expenses               Merger-related expenses   $ 15   $ 14   7 %   Branding     7     7   0 %   Retirement Income Security Ventures     2     1   100 %   Taxes, licenses and fees     2     3   -33 %   Other     10     —    NM                       Total other expenses   $ 36   $ 25   44 %                    Other expenses for Other Operations include expenses that are corporate in nature such as merger-related expenses, restructuring costs, branding, charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of Federal Communications Commission license intangibles on our radio clusters, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations, excluding those associated with our inter-segment investment advisory fees.    78    Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The amount labeled as “Other” in the table above relates primarily to costs associated with the relocation of our corporate offices and facilities expense on held-for-use properties.  Merger-related expenses are the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. These actions will be ongoing and are expected to be substantially complete by the first half of 2009. Our current estimate of integration expenses is approximately $205 million to $215 million, pre-tax and excludes amounts capitalized or recorded to goodwill.  Interest and Debt Expense  The timing and/or discretionary nature of uses of cash for the repurchase of stock, incentive compensation and the availability of funds from our cash management account may result in changes in external financing and volatility in interest expense. For additional information on our financing activities, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” below.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The increase in interest and debt expense was due primarily to the increase in our debt, including $750 million issued late in the first quarter of 2007 to pay down short-term debt that was used to refinance several high coupon securities that we called late in 2006 and early 2007 and for the repurchase of stock. We also issued $375 million to fund a captive reinsurance company. This new subsidiary was created for the purpose of reinsuring the policy liabilities of our existing insurance affiliates, primarily related to statutory reserves on UL products with secondary guarantees. These reserves are calculated under prevailing statutory reserving requirements as promulgated under AG38. The transaction released approximately $300 million of capital previously supporting our UL products with secondary guarantees. We intend to use the released capital for general corporate purposes, including for share repurchase and supporting future business growth.  Federal Income Tax Benefit  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 to 2007  The effective federal income tax rate decreased to 33% from 40%, as increased losses did not have a proportionate increase in permanent differences between GAAP and income tax basis adjustments.    79    CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS  Details underlying our consolidated investment balances (in millions) were as follows:                        As ofMarch 31,2008   As ofDecember 31,2007   Percentage ofTotal Investments            As ofMarch 31,2008     As ofDecember 31,2007     Investments                   Available-for-sale securities:                   Fixed maturity   $ 55,624   $ 56,276   77.7 %   78.2 %   Equity     474     518   0.7 %   0.7 %   Trading securities     2,714     2,730   3.8 %   3.8 %   Mortgage loans on real estate     7,532     7,423   10.5 %   10.3 %   Real estate     175     258   0.2 %   0.4 %   Policy loans     2,804     2,835   4.0 %   4.0 %   Derivative instruments     1,091     807   1.5 %   1.1 %   Alternative investments     789     799   1.1 %   1.1 %   Other investments     352     276   0.5 %   0.4 %                             Total investments   $ 71,555   $ 71,922   100.0 %   100.0 %                            Investment Objective  Invested assets are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management, since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”  Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification  Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.  We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.  Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios  Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as available-for-sale and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both available-for-sale and trading portfolios.  Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the below tables. These tables agree in total with the presentation of available-for-sale securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the available-for-sale portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.    80                           As of March 31, 2008        AmortizedCost   UnrealizedGains   UnrealizedLosses   FairValue   % FairValue     Available-For-Sale -

Refer below to “Trading Securities” section for further details.    82    The change in gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities from December 31, 2007, to March 31, 2008, was $1.2 billion. This increase was concentrated primarily in our residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and investments in corporate bonds in the financial and industrial sectors. The increase in unrealized losses in these asset classes was attributable to a combination of reduced liquidity in several market segments and deterioration in credit fundamentals. In addition, the increase in our gross unrealized losses was attributable to securities with various rating categories, with 19% of the securities with a AAA rating, 29% with a AA rating, 22% with an A rating, 20% with a BBB rating and 10% with a rating of BB or below.  Available-for-Sale Securities  Because the general intent of the available-for-sale accounting rules is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses since the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. In a similar manner, adjustments to the balance of other contract holder funds are made because we either have a contractual obligation or have a consistent historical practice of making allocations of investment gains or losses to certain contract holders. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted, since unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.  The quality of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire available-for-sale fixed maturity security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:                                     Rating Agency Equivalent Designation   As of March 31, 2008     As of December 31, 2007     NAIC Designation     AmortizedCost     FairValue     % ofTotal     AmortizedCost     FairValue     % ofTotal     Investment Grade Securities                              1   Aaa / Aa / A   $ 34,625     $ 34,029     61.2 %   $ 34,648     $ 34,741     61.8 %  2   Baa     18,526       18,477     33.2 %     18,168       18,339     32.6 %                                                           53,151       52,506     94.4 %     52,816       53,080     94.4 %   Below Investment Grade Securities     3   Ba     2,162       2,114     3.9 %     2,184       2,159     3.8 %  4   B     809       746     1.3 %     787       783     1.4 %  5   Caa and lower     316       244     0.4 %     270       238     0.4 %  6   In or near default     11       14     0.0 %     12       16     0.0 %                                                           3,298       3,118     5.6 %     3,253       3,196     5.6 %                                                    Total securities   $ 56,449     $ 55,624     100.0 %   $ 56,069     $ 56,276     100.0 %                                                    Securities below investment grade as a % of total available-for-sale fixed maturity securities     5.8 %     5.6 %         5.8 %     5.7 %      Comparisons between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).  The estimated fair value for all private securities was $7.7 billion as of March 31, 2008, compared to $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, representing approximately 11% of total invested assets as of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007.  As of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $19 million and $21 million, respectively.    83    Trading Securities  Trading securities, which support certain reinsurance funds withheld and our Modco reinsurance agreements, are carried at estimated fair value and changes in estimated fair value are recorded in net income as they occur. Investment results for these portfolios, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements. Offsetting these amounts are corresponding changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement. See Note 1 in our 2007 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting for Modco.  Mortgage-Backed Securities  Our fixed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.  We limit the extent of our risk on mortgage-backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of March 31, 2008, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. A significant amount of assets in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.  Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct investments in asset-backed securities collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime, Alt-A and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have Prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.  The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans have recently led to higher delinquency rates, especially for loans originated in the past few years. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $9.3 billion and an unrealized loss of $377 million, or 4%, as of March 31, 2008. The unrealized loss was primarily due to a lack of investor interest in RMBS causing a general level of illiquidity in the market and resulting in price declines in many structured products.    84    The market value of investments backed by subprime loans was $669 million and represented 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2008. Investments rated A or above represented 96% of the subprime investments and $321 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward. Available-for-sale securities represent most of the subprime exposure with trading securities being only $18 million, or 2.7%, as of March 31, 2008.

Monoline insurers provide guarantees on debt for issuers, often in the form of credit wraps, which enhance the credit of the issuer. Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bonds issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.    87    The following summarizes our exposure to Monoline insurers (in millions):                              As of March 31, 2008      DirectExposure   InsuredBonds (1)   TotalAmortizedCost   TotalUnrealizedGain   TotalUnrealizedLoss   TotalFairValue   Monoline Name                           AMBAC   $ —    $ 110   $ 110   $ 3   $ 4   $ 109   CAPMAC     —      4     4     —      —      4   FGIC     6     55     61     1     5     57   FSA     —      41     41     2     —      43   MBIA     12     77     89     4     4     89   MGIC     11     8     19     —      2     17   PMI GROUP INC     27     —      27     —      6     21   RADIAN GROUP INC     19     —      19     —      7     12   SECURITY CAPITAL ASSURANCE LTD     2     —      2     —      —      2   XL CAPITAL LTD     72     65     137     2     11     128                                         Total (2)   $ 149   $ 360   $ 509   $ 12   $ 39   $ 482                                             (1)  Additional indirect insured exposure through structured securities is excluded from this table.

Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were no impaired mortgage loans as of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007. As of March 31, 2008, there were no commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. As of December 31, 2007, we had one commercial mortgage loan that was two or more payments delinquent. The total principal and interest due on these loans as of December 31, 2007, was less than $1 million. See Note 4 for additional detail regarding impaired mortgage loans. See Note 1 in our 2007 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.    89    Alternative Investments  The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consists primarily of investments in limited partnerships, were as follows:                  As ofMarch 31,2008   As ofDecember 31,2007   Individual Markets:           Annuities   $ 82   $ 108   Life Insurance     536     528   Employer Markets:           Retirement Products     120     130   Other Operations     51     33                 Total alternative investments   $ 789   $ 799                Income derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:                      For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,   Change        2008     2007     Individual Markets:                Annuities   $ (1 )   $ 4   -125 %   Life Insurance     (1 )     10   -110 %   Employer Markets:                Retirement Products     (2 )     5   -140 %   Other Operations     (1 )     1   -200 %                       Total alternative investments (1)   $ (5 )   $ 20   -125 %                           (1)  Includes net investment income on the required statutory surplus invested within alternative investments.  The decline in our alternative investment income presented in the table above was due primarily to the general deterioration of the financial markets during the first quarter of 2008 and the weakness was spread across the various categories of investments within our alternative investment portfolio.  As of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, alternative investments include investments in approximately 104 and 102 different partnerships, respectively, that allow us to gain exposure to a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes such as venture capital, hedge funds, oil and gas and real estate. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Select partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.    90    Net Investment Income  Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:                       For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,     Change        2008     2007       Net Investment Income                 Available-for-sale fixed maturity securities   $ 858     $ 829     3 %   Available-for-sale equity securities     9       9     0 %   Trading securities     42       45     -7 %   Mortgage loans on real estate     116       131     -11 %   Real estate     7       11     -36 %   Standby real estate equity commitments     1       4     -75 %   Policy loans     45       43     5 %   Invested cash     19       18     6 %   Change in call option market value (1)      (97 )     1     NM     Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond makewhole premiums (2)     7       15     -53 %   Alternative investments (3)     (5 )     20     NM     Consent fees     —        7     -100 %   Other investments     1       2     -50 %                         Investment income     1,003       1,135     -12 %   Investment expense     (35 )     (45 )   22 %                         Net investment income   $ 968     $ 1,090     -11 %                             (1)  The change in the call option market value in net investment income largely offsets the change in interest credited caused by fluctuations in the value of our indexed annuity contract liabilities.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include changes in the fair value of call options, commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.  The growth in net investment income on fixed maturity securities when comparing the first quarter of 2008 to the same period in 2007 was attributable to positive net flows and continued growth in our business from sales and favorable persistency.  Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums  Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.  The decline in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing the three months ended March 31, 2008, to 2007 was attributable primarily to the general tightening of credit conditions in the market resulting in less refinancing activity and less prepayment income.  Realized Gains and Losses  The detail of the realized gain (loss) (in millions) was as follows:                    For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,        2008     2007     Fixed maturity securities available-for-sale:             Gross gains   $ 9     $ 55     Gross losses     (100 )     (7 )   Equity securities available-for-sale:             Gross gains     3       2     Gain (loss) on other investments     25       (4 )   Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds     25       (20 )                     Total realized gain (loss) on investments, excluding trading securities     (38 )     26     Loss on derivative instruments, excluding reinsurance embedded derivatives     (3 )     —                        Total realized gain (loss) on investments and derivative instruments     (41 )     26     Gain on sale of subsidiaries/businesses     3       —                        Total realized gain (loss)   $ (38 )   $ 26                       Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments included in realized loss on investments above   $ (92 )   $ (4 )                    Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true up to     92     our DAC, VOBA, DSI, and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized gains and losses reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.  Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to hold the security until its value recovers. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as available-for-sale. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the available-for-sale classification.  We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.  When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated fair value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2007 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.  Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of other-than-temporary impairments (in millions) were as follows:                    For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,          2008   2007   Change   Other-Than-Temporary Impairments              Corporate bonds   $ 91   $ 4   NM   Asset and mortgage-backed securities:     1     —    NM                    Total fixed maturity securities     92     4   NM                    Total other-than-temporary impairments   $ 92   $ 4   NM                   The $92 million of impairments taken during the quarter are split between $49 million of credit related impairments and $53 million on non-credit related impairments. The credit related impairments are largely attributable to deterioration in the credit fundamentals of several Monoline insurers. The non-credit related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which the company is uncertain of its intent to hold until recovery or maturity.  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities  When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, since the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.    93    For our securities classified as available-for-sale that we held as of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, that were subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status, the fair value, amortized cost, unrealized loss (in millions) and total time period that the security has been in an unrealized loss position were as follows:                              As of March 31, 2008        FairValue   % FairValue     AmortizedCost   % AmortizedCost     UnrealizedLoss   % UnrealizedLoss     < = 90 days   $ 29   20.4 %   $ 35   16.1 %   $ 6   7.9 %   > 90 days but < = 180 days     4   2.8 %     5   2.3 %     1   1.3 %   > 180 days but < = 270 days     20   14.1 %     25   11.5 %     5   6.6 %   > 270 days but < = 1 year     49   34.5 %     67   30.7 %     18   23.7 %   > 1 year     40   28.2 %     86   39.4 %     46   60.5 %                                         Total   $ 142   100.0 %   $ 218   100.0 %   $ 76   100.0 %                                               As of December 31, 2007        FairValue   % FairValue     AmortizedCost   % AmortizedCost     UnrealizedLoss   % UnrealizedLoss     < = 90 days   $ 63   58.4 %   $ 65   48.5 %   $ 2   7.7 %   > 90 days but < = 180 days     16   14.8 %     28   20.9 %     12   46.2 %   > 180 days but < = 270 days     23   21.3 %     30   22.4 %     7   26.9 %   > 270 days but < = 1 year     1   0.9 %     1   0.7 %     —    0.0 %   > 1 year     5   4.6 %     10   7.5 %     5   19.2 %                                         Total   $ 108   100.0 %   $ 134   100.0 %   $ 26   100.0 %                                          94    We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities.

As of March 31, 2008, 42.5% of these were rated as investment grade while 50.6% were rated as investment grade as of December 31, 2007. As of March 31, 2008, the range of maturity dates for these securities varies, with 35.5% maturing in greater than 10 years, 30.1% maturing between 5 and 10 years, 32.8% maturing between 1 and 5 years and 1.6% maturing in 1 year or less. As of December 31, 2007, the range of maturity dates for these securities was 46.4% maturing in greater than 10 years, 26.7% maturing between 5 and 10 years and 26.9% maturing between 1 and 5 years.  As of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, 89.9% and 90.7%, respectively, of total publicly traded and private securities in unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 4 for ratings and maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio.  As of March 31, 2008, gross unrealized losses totaled $2.5 billion compared to gross unrealized losses of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. The change in unrealized losses was due primarily to weakness in the corporate credit markets and a general level of illiquidity in the structure product markets during the period. This increase was concentrated primarily in our residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and investments in corporate bonds in the financial and industrial sectors. The increase in unrealized losses in these asset classes was attributable to a combination of reduced liquidity in several market segments and deterioration in credit fundamentals.    99    Unrealized Loss on Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale in Excess of $10 million  As of March 31, 2008, available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities with gross unrealized losses greater than $10 million (in millions) were as follows:                           As of March 31, 2008      Length of Time in Loss Position   FairValue   AmortizedCost   UnrealizedLoss   Investment Grade                  Credit-linked note   >1 year   $ 212   $ 400   $ 188   Credit-linked note   >270 days but < or = 1 year     116     250     134   Credit-linked note   >270 days but < or = 1 year     102     200     98   Domestic bank and finance   >90 days but < or = 180 days     396     461     65   Domestic bank and finance   >1 year     103     123     20   Domestic bank and finance   >270 days but < or = 1 year     98     116     18   International bank and finance   <= 90 days     12     30     18   International forestry   >270 days but <=1 year     80     98     18   UK bank and finance   >180 days but <=270 days     43     60     17   Domestic finance   >1 year     51     67     16   UK bank and finance   >270 days but <=1 year     89     105     16   Domestic brokerage   >1 year     96     110     14   Domestic bank and finance   >270 days but < or = 1 year     54     66     12   UK bank and finance   >1 year     71     83     12   UK bank and finance   >1 year     45     56     11   Domestic bank and finance   >90 days but < or = 180 days     100     110     10   Domestic communications   >270 days but <=1 year     43     53     10   Domestic finance   >270 days but <=1 year     34     44     10   Domestic retailer   >1 year     61     71     10   Property and casualty insurance   >180 days but <=270 days     62     72     10                          Total investment grade      $ 1,868   $ 2,575   $ 707                          Non Investment Grade                  Domestic media company   >1 year   $ 33   $ 70   $ 37   Domestic bank and finance   >90 days but < or = 180 days     48     67     19   Domestic entertainment   > 1 year     27     43     16   Domestic homebuilding   > 1 year     79     91     12                          Total non investment grade      $ 187   $ 271   $ 84                         The information presented above is subject to rapidly changing conditions. As such, we expect that the level of securities with overall unrealized losses will fluctuate, as will the level of unrealized loss securities that are subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring. The volatility of financial market conditions results in increased recognition of both investment gains and losses, as portfolio risks are adjusted through sales and purchases. As discussed above, this is consistent with the classification of our investment portfolios as available-for-sale.  Credit-Linked Notes  As of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, other contract holder funds on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included $1.2 billion outstanding in funding agreements of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”). LNL invested the proceeds of $850 million received for issuing three funding agreements in 2006 and 2007 into three separate credit-linked notes originated by third party companies and $300 million of such agreements were assumed as a result of the merger of Jefferson-Pilot into LNL. The $850 million of credit-linked notes are classified as asset-backed securities and are included in our fixed maturity securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The $300 million of investments which were assumed as a result of the merger are classified as corporate bonds and are included in our fixed maturity securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.    100    We earn a spread between the coupon received on the credit-linked note and the interest credited on the funding agreement. Our credit linked notes were created using a trust that combines highly rated assets with credit default swaps to produce a multi-class structured security. Our affiliate, Delaware Investments, actively manages the credit default swaps in the underlying portfolios. The high quality asset in two of these transactions is a AAA-rated ABS secured by a pool of credit card receivables. The high quality asset in the third transaction is a guaranteed investment contract issued by MBIA, which is further secured by a pool of high quality assets.  Consistent with other debt market instruments, we are exposed to credit losses within the structure of the credit-linked notes, which could result in principal losses to our investments. However, we have attempted to protect our investments from credit losses through the multi-tiered class structure of the credit-linked note, which requires the subordinated classes of the investment pool to absorb all of the initial credit losses. LNL owns the mezzanine tranche of these investments, which currently carries a mid- or low-AA rating. Generally, based upon our models, the transactions can sustain anywhere from 6-11 defaults, depending on the transaction, in the underlying collateral pools with no loss to LNL. However, if that number of defaults is realized, any additional defaults will significantly impact our recovery. Once the subordination is completely exhausted, losses will be incurred on LNL’s investment. In general, the entire investment can be lost with 3-5 additional defaults. To date, there have been no defaults in any of the underlying collateral pools. Similar to other debt market instruments our maximum principal loss is limited to our original investment of $850 million as of March 31, 2008.  As in the general markets, spreads on these transactions have widened, causing unrealized losses. As of March 31, 2008, we had unrealized losses of $420 million on the $850 million in credit linked notes. As described more fully in Note 1 of our 2007 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for other-than-temporary impairments. Based upon this review and the information in the paragraph above, we believe that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007. The following summarizes the fair value to amortized cost ratio of the credit-linked notes:                        As ofApril 30,2008     As ofMarch 31,2008     As ofDecember 31,2007     Fair value   $ 532     $ 430     $ 660     Amortized cost     850       850       850     Fair value to amortized cost ratio     63 %     51 %     78 %  The following summarizes the exposure of the credit-linked notes’ underlying collateral by industry and rating as of March 31, 2008:                              Industry   AAA     AA     A     BBB     BB     B     Total     Financial intermediaries   0 %   7 %   2 %   2 %   0 %   1 %   12 %   Telecommunications   0 %   0 %   6 %   4 %   0 %   0 %   10 %   Oil & gas   0 %   1 %   2 %   4 %   0 %   0 %   7 %   Chemicals & plastics   0 %   0 %   3 %   1 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Insurance   0 %   2 %   2 %   0 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Utilities   0 %   0 %   4 %   0 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Drugs   1 %   2 %   1 %   0 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Monoline insurance   2 %   0 %   1 %   0 %   0 %   0 %   3 %   Retailers (except food & drug)   0 %   0 %   2 %   2 %   0 %   0 %   4 %   Other Industry < 4% (32 Industries)   2 %   5 %   22 %   17 %   2 %   0 %   48 %                                               Total   5 %   17 %   45 %   30 %   2 %   1 %   100 %                                              REINSURANCE  Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limits is reinsured with other insurers. We seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to limit our exposure to mortality losses and enhance our capital management.  Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. As of March 31, 2008, the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $1.3 billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance coverage with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances. The consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 reflect premiums, benefits and DAC, net of insurance ceded. Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.    101    Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of March 31, 2008, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $8.4 billion compared to $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers and we monitor concentration, as well as financial strength ratings, of our principal reinsurers. Swiss Re represents our largest exposure. In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business to Swiss Re primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements. Because we are not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from the business sold to Swiss Re, which totaled $4.4 billion and $4.3 billion as of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. Swiss Re has funded a trust with a balance of $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2008, to support this business. In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and certain mortgage loans. Our liabilities for funds withheld and embedded derivatives included $2.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2008, related to the business sold to Swiss Re.  Included in the business sold to Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance in 2001 was disability income business. Swiss Re is disputing its obligation to pay approximately $50 million of reinsurance recoverables on certain of this income disability business. We have agreed to arbitrate this dispute with Swiss Re. Although the outcome of the arbitration is uncertain, we currently believe that it is probable that we will ultimately collect the full amount of the reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re and that Swiss Re will ultimately remain at risk on all of its obligations on the disability income business that it acquired from us in 2001.  On July 31, 2007, we entered into a reinsurance arrangement with Swiss Re covering Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, our rider related to our Individual Market’s variable annuity products. Under the arrangement, Swiss Re provides 50% quota share coinsurance of the lifetime guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for business written in 2007 and 2008, up to a total of $3.8 billion in rider sales. We expect to achieve the sales level covered under this arrangement during the second quarter of 2008. The arrangement will not be renewed for new business, but this will not affect our ability to continue to write new business.  During the third quarter of 2006, one of our reinsurers, Scottish Re Group Ltd (“Scottish Re”), received rating downgrades from various rating agencies. Of the $800 million of fixed annuity business that we reinsure with Scottish Re, approximately 73% is reinsured through the use of modified coinsurance treaties, in which we possess the investments that support the reserves ceded to Scottish Re. For our annuity business ceded on a coinsurance basis, Scottish Re had previously established an irrevocable investment trust supporting the reserves for the benefit of LNC. In addition to fixed annuities, we have approximately $112 million of policy liabilities on the life insurance business we have reinsured with Scottish Re. Scottish Re continues to perform under its contractual responsibilities to us. We continue to evaluate the impact of these ratings downgrades with respect to our existing exposures to Scottish Re. Based on current information, we do not believe that Scottish Re’s ratings downgrades will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.  As of March 31, 2008, we had reinsurance recoverables of $721 million and policy loans of $48 million, which were related to the businesses of Jefferson-Pilot that are coinsured with Household International (“HI”) affiliates. HI has provided payment, performance and capital maintenance guarantees with respect to the balances receivable. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk related to reinsurance activities.  REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow  Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees, investment advisory fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $98 and $469 million for the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in cash provided by operating activities is primarily related to the timing of federal income tax payments. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.  The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing     102     availability of long-term public financing under an SEC filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases and acquisitions.  Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:                     For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,    For the Year Ended December 31,      2008   2007   2007   Dividends from Subsidiaries               LNL   $ 200   $ 146   $ 769   First Penn-Pacific     —      —      150   Lincoln Financial Media     658     17     86   Delaware Investments     15     15     55   Other non-regulated companies(1)     —      —      395   Lincoln UK     —      16     75   Loan Repayments and Interest from Subsidiary               LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)      21     21     82                         $ 894   $ 215   $ 1,612                       Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items               Net capital received from stock option exercises   $ 7   $ 47   $ 107                           (1)  For the year ended December 31, 2007, amount represents a dividend of Bank of America shares to LNC from a subsidiary occurring in September 2007.     (2)  Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.  The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.  Subsidiaries  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or (ii) the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of (i) 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  Based upon anticipated ongoing positive statutory earnings and favorable credit markets, we expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $957 million in 2008 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The actual amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.  Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk based capital levels well above current regulatory required levels. As     103     mentioned earlier, more than 75% of our life sales consist of products containing secondary guarantees, which require reserving practices under AG38. Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements. See “Financing Activities” below for additional details.  Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of March 31, 2008, reported in the revolving credit facilities table in “Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.2 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of our non-U.S. domiciled subsidiary to LNL on UL business with secondary guarantees. Recognizing that LOCs are generally one to five years in duration, it is likely that our insurance companies will apply a mix of LOCs, reinsurance and capital market strategies in addressing long-term AG38 and XXX needs. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the RBC impact of the UL business with secondary guarantee products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on UL business with secondary guarantee products. We are continuing to pursue capital management strategies related to our AG38 reserves involving reinsurance and securitizations. We completed our issuance of $375 million of 6.30% senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2007, which resulted in the release of approximately $300 million of capital previously supporting our UL products with secondary guarantees. See “Results of Other Operations” for additional information. We are targeting another transaction during 2008 that will finance a portion of statutory reserves related to our insurance products with secondary guarantees. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory” in our 2007 Form 10-K for further information on AG38 reserves. In addition, a portion of our term life insurance business is reinsured with a domestic reinsurance captive as part of our overall strategy of managing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. There are no outstanding LOCs related to this business.  A new statutory reserving standard (VACARVM) is being developed by the NAIC replacing current statutory reserve practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, such as GMWBs. The timing for adoption of VACARVM is anticipated to occur sometime in 2008, with an effective date of December 31, 2008. Because the NAIC has not determined the final version of VACARVM, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact that VACARVM will have on our liquidity and capital resources. However, in its current draft form, VACARVM has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. We plan to utilize existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as pursue additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, to lessen any negative impact on statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. However, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower risk-based capital ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.  Lincoln UK’s operations consist primarily of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products. Lincoln UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the FSA and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K. Capital Resources Requirement. All insurance companies operating in the U.K. also have to complete a risk-based capital (“RBC”) assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC requirements. In addition, the FSA has imposed certain minimum capital requirements for the combined U.K. subsidiaries. Lincoln UK typically maintains approximately 1.5 to 2 times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory margin. As is the case with regulated insurance companies in the U.S., changes to regulatory capital requirements can impact the dividend capacity of the U.K. insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company. During the first quarter of 2008, Lincoln UK fell below its targeted capital levels due to significant increases in corporate bond spreads and restrictions imposed by the U.K. statutory valuation basis. As a result of falling below targeted capital levels, Lincoln UK did not pay dividends to the holding company. However, this did not have an adverse effect on our liquidity.  Financing Activities  Although our subsidiaries generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.  We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.    104    Details underlying debt and financing activity (in millions) were as follows:                                For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2008      BeginningBalance   Issuance   MaturitiesandRepayments     Changein FairValueHedges   OtherChanges (1)     EndingBalance   Short-Term Debt                             Commercial paper   $ 265   $ —    $ —      $ —    $ (54 )   $ 211   Current maturities of long-term debt     285     —      (100 )     —      15       200                                             Total short-term debt   $ 550   $ —    $ (100 )   $ —    $ (39 )   $ 411                                             Long-Term Debt                             Senior notes   $ 2,892   $ —    $ —      $ 23   $ (14 )   $ 2,901   Junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts     155     —      —        —      —        155   Capital securities     1,571     —      —        —      —        1,571                                             Total long-term debt   $ 4,618   $ —    $ —      $ 23   $ (14 )   $ 4,627                                                 (1)  Other changes include the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.  Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:                     Expiration Date   As of March 31, 2008        MaximumAvailable   LoansOutstanding   Revolving Credit Facilities              Five-year revolving credit facility   March 2011   $ 1,750   $ —    Five-year revolving credit facility   February 2011     1,350     —    U.K. revolving credit facility   November 2008     20     —                     Total      $ 3,120   $ —                     Letters of credit issued          $ 1,794                 The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our former Reinsurance segment. LOCs are primarily used to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of domestic clients of the former Reinsurance segment who have contracted with the reinsurance subsidiaries not domiciled in the United States and, as discussed above, for the reserve credit provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance company to our domestic insurance companies for ceded business.  Under the credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. As of March 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all such covenants. All of our credit agreements are unsecured.  If current debt ratings and claims paying ratings were downgraded in the future, certain covenants of various contractual obligations may be triggered which could negatively impact overall liquidity. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. As of March 31, 2008, we maintained adequate current financial strength and senior debt ratings and do not anticipate any ratings-based impact to future liquidity. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2007 Form 10-K for additional information on our ratings.  Divestitures  For a discussion of our divestitures, see “Introduction – Acquisitions and Dispositions.”    105    Alternative Sources of Liquidity  In order to maximize the use of available cash, the holding company maintains an inter-company cash management account where subsidiaries can borrow from the holding company to meet their short-term needs and can invest their short-term funds with the holding company. The holding company finances this program from its primary sources of cash flow discussed above. Depending on the overall cash availability or need, the holding company invests excess cash in short-term investments or borrows funds in the financial markets.  The holding company had an average loan balance of $435 million from the cash management account during the first quarter of 2008. The holding company had a maximum and minimum amount of financing that is used from the cash management account during this period of $603 million and $284 million, respectively.  Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2008, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $718 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $480 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements.  LNC has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is rated A-1, P-2, F-1. The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of credit. During the first quarter of 2008, LNC had an average of $361 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $575 million outstanding at any time. LNC had $211 million of commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2008.  Uses of Capital  Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.  Return of Capital to Stockholders  One of the holding company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our stockholders. Through dividends and stock repurchases, we have an established record of providing significant cash returns to our stockholders. We have increased our dividend in each of the last 25 years. In determining our dividend payout, we balance the desire to increase the dividend against capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data) were as follows:                        For the ThreeMonths EndedMarch 31,          For the Year Ended December 31,      2008   2007   Change     2007   Dividends to stockholders   $ 110   $ 109   1 %   $ 430   Repurchase of common stock     286     512   -44 %     986                           Total cash returned to stockholders   $ 396   $ 621   -36 %   $ 1,416                           Number of shares repurchased     5.450     7.215   -24 %     15.381   Average price per share   $ 52.42   $ 70.92   -26 %   $ 64.13  On November 6, 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to stockholders from $0.395 per share to $0.415 per share effective in 2008.  Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow  As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity and surplus note interest payments of its insurance company subsidiaries. The insurance company subsidiaries’ dividend capacity is impacted by factors influencing their risk-based capital and statutory earnings performance. Currently, we expect to have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our obligations in 2008. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2007 Form 10-K.    106    OTHER MATTERS  Other Factors Affecting Our Business  In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries, to make permanent recent reductions in individual tax rates, to permanently repeal the estate tax and to increase regulation of our annuity and investment management businesses. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A – Risk Factors” in our 2007 Form 10-K and “Forward-looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  See Note 15 in our 2007 Form 10-K for discussion of our restructuring activities.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, default risk and credit risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important in the Employer Markets and Individual Markets businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels and the shape of the yield curve. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to reduce interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. The primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages.  Interest Rate Risk  With respect to accumulation and investment-oriented products, we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread, or margin, between investment income and interest credited to account values. If we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers, our spreads are reduced. Provided interest rates continue to gradually return to levels that are more typical from a long-term perspective, we do not view the near term risk to spreads over the next twelve months to be material. The combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next twelve months, asset-liability management strategies, flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender charges and other switching costs all work together to mitigate this risk. The interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial, relatively rapid increase or decrease in interest rates that is then sustained over a long period.    107    Interest Rate Risk—Falling Rates  The spreads on our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life, universal life (“UL”) and fixed portion of variable universal life (“VUL”) insurance policies are at risk if interest rates decline and remain low for a period of time, which has generally been the case in recent years. Should interest rates remain at current levels that are significantly lower than those existing prior to the declines of recent years, the average earned rate of return on our annuity and UL investment portfolios will continue to decline. Declining portfolio yields may cause the spreads between investment portfolio yields and the interest rate credited to contract holders to deteriorate as our ability to manage spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies. Minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and UL policies generally range from 1.5% to 5.0%, with an average guaranteed rate of approximately 4%. The following table provides detail on the percentage differences between the current interest rates being credited to contract holders and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate, broken out by contract holder account values reported within the Employer Markets and Individual Markets businesses (in millions):                           As of March 31, 2008        Account Values    Percent of TotalAccountValues        EmployerMarkets -DefinedContribution    Individual Markets   Total          Annuities   LifeInsurance       Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                       CD and on-benefit type annuities   $ 1,448   $ 10,583   $ —    $ 12,031   23.56 %   Discretionary rate setting products (1)                        No difference     3,251     3,244     11,621     18,116   35.48 %   up to .1%     4,660     1,733     49     6,442   12.61 %   0.11% to .20%     2     849     4,447     5,298   10.37 %   0.21% to .30%     4     179     2,428     2,611   5.11 %   0.31% to .40%     1     162     204     367   0.72 %   0.41% to .50%     275     40     803     1,118   2.19 %   0.51% to .60%     1,002     56     106     1,164   2.28 %   0.61% to .70%     85     281     1,054     1,420   2.78 %   0.71% to .80%     44     11     45     100   0.20 %   0.81% to .90%     —      2     3     5   0.01 %   0.91% to 1.0%     155     7     170     332   0.65 %   1.01% to 1.50%     29     50     617     696   1.36 %   1.51% to 2.00%     78     403     288     769   1.51 %   2.01% to 2.50%     —      398     14     412   0.81 %   2.51% to 3.00%     9     —      2     11   0.02 %   3.01% and above     174     1     —      175   0.34 %                                   Total discretionary rate setting products     9,769     7,416     21,851     39,036   76.44 %                                   Total account values   $ 11,217   $ 17,999   $ 21,851   $ 51,067   100.00 %                                       (1)  Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.  The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.  Interest Rate Risk—Rising Rates  For both annuities and UL, a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders. The portfolios supporting these products have fixed-rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from one to ten years or more. Accordingly, the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields.     108     As rates rise, the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage-backed securities prepayments. The greater and faster the rise in interest rates, the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates. If we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread, the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors’ new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders. If we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders, our spreads will narrow. We devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. Such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out-of-the-money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions. With these instruments in place, the potential adverse impact of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances.  Debt  We manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise.  Derivatives  We have entered into derivative transactions to reduce our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve more stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to policyholders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps and treasury locks. During the first three months of 2008, the more significant changes in our derivative positions were as follows:        •    Interest rate swap agreements hedging floating rate bond coupon payments with a notional amount of $37 million matured or terminated, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $981 million. A gain of $1 million was recognized on the terminations. We also entered into $1.6 billion notional amount of interest rate swap agreements hedging a portion of the liability exposure on certain options in our variable annuity products, resulting in a total notional amount of $6.3 billion. These interest rate swap agreements convert floating rate bond coupon payments into a fixed rate of return;        •    Interest rate cap agreements with a notional amount of $250 million matured, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $3.9 billion. These interest rate cap agreements are used to hedge our annuity business against a negative impact of a significant and sustained rise in interest rates; and        •    We entered into and terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $80 million and $90 million, respectively, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $40 million. These swaps are used to hedge interest rate risk associated with assets that support our annuity liabilities. A loss of $2 million was recognized on certain terminations and was reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). The loss will be reclassified from accumulated OCI recognized in income over the life of the purchased assets. A loss of $1 million was recognized on other terminations and was recorded in net income as benefits.  In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  Foreign Currency Denominated Investments  We invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to United States Dollar-Denominated (“USD”) securities. We use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds.  We use foreign currency swaps to convert the cash flow of foreign currency securities to U.S. dollars. A foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange the currencies of two different countries at a specified rate of exchange in the future.  We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge dividends received from our U.K. based subsidiary, Lincoln UK. The foreign currency forward contracts obligate us to deliver a specified amount of currency at a future date and a specified exchange rate.    109    Equity Market Risk  Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), and deferred front-end sales loads (“DFEL”). However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets.  Fee Revenues  The fee revenues of our Investment Management segment and fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values. These fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management. In a severe equity market decline, fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions. Such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed-income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors’ customers.  Assets and Liabilities  While we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed-income investments, the returns on, and values of, these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed-income investments. These investments, however, add diversification benefits to our fixed-income investments.  We have exposure to changes in our stock price through stock appreciation rights issued. This program is being hedged with equity derivatives.  Derivatives Hedging Equity Market Risk  During the first three months of 2008, the more significant changes in our derivative positions hedging equity market risk were as follows:        •    We had 0.2 million call options on Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC”) stock mature, resulting in a remaining 0.4 million call options on an equal number of shares of LNC stock. These call options are hedging the increase in liabilities arising from stock appreciation rights granted on LNC stock;        •    We entered into variance swaps with a notional amount of $25 million, resulting in a total notional amount of $31 million. These swaps are used to hedge the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products;         •    We entered into Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® call options with a notional amount of $535 million. In addition, call options with a notional amount of $475 million expired, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $2.9 billion. These call options are hedging the impact of the equity-index interest credited to our equity annuity products;        •    We entered into and terminated put option agreements with a notional amount of $825 million and $400 million, respectively, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $4.5 billion. These put options are hedging a portion of the liability exposure on certain options in our variable annuity products. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the terminations; and        •    We had net purchases and terminations in financial futures with a notional amount of $1.4 billion, resulting in a remaining notional amount of $1.9 billion. These futures are hedging a portion of the liability exposure on certain options in variable annuity products. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the terminations.    110    Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity  Due to the use of our RTM process and our hedging strategies as described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2007 Form 10-K, we expect that in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The table below presents our estimate of the annual, after-tax, after-DAC, impact on income from operations, from both a 1% and 10% decline in the equity markets (in millions), excluding any impact related to sales, prospective and retrospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:                 Segment    Relevant Measure   Impact per1% Change   Impact per10% Change   Investment Management   Composite of Equity Assets (1)   $ 2   $ 15        Individual Markets - Annuities   Average daily change in the S&P 500     3     37        Employer Markets - Defined Contribution   Average daily change in the S&P 500     1     14        Lincoln UK   Average daily change in the FTSE 100     —      4       (1)  The Investment Management segment manages equity-based assets of varying styles (growth, value, blend and international) and underlying products (mutual funds, institutional accounts, insurance separate accounts, etc.). No single equity benchmark is an accurate predictor of the change in earnings for this segment and the earnings impact summarized above includes the return on seed capital.  The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected annual effect. The result of the above factors should be multiplied by 25% to arrive at an estimated quarterly effect. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter due to the fact that fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.  Default Risk  Our portfolio of invested assets was $71.6 billion and $71.9 billion as of March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Of this total, $45.5 billion and $46.1 billion consist of corporate bonds and $7.5 billion and $7.4 billion consist of commercial mortgages as of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. We manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards, prudently limiting allocations to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and property type. For each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates, our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality and industry group. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing.  We are depending on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements. In order to minimize the risk of default losses, we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor. We generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an A credit rating or above.  Credit-Related Derivatives  We use various credit-related derivatives to minimize exposure to various credit-related risks. We use credit default swaps to hedge against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit default swap allows us to put the bond back to the counterparty at par upon a default event by the bond issuer. A default event is defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay or obligation acceleration. As of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, we had no purchased credit default swaps outstanding.    111    We also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to investors. The credit default swaps hedge the investor against a drop in bond prices due to credit concerns of certain bond issuers. A credit swap allows the investor to put the bond back to us at par upon a default event by the bond issuer. As of March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, we had credit default swaps with a notional amount of $60 million, which expire in 2010 through 2012.  Credit Risk  By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls and we are required to make a payment). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or the Company.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2008, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.    112    PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1.
