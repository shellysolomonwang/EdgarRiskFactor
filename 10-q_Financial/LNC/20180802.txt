Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed in 2018; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2018. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business activities, see the risks described in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q and below.   ﻿   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss) that are United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures, we also provide certain non-GAAP financial measures as we believe they are meaningful to evaluate and assess the results of our operating segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the primary non-GAAP financial measures our management believes that explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses. We have excluded certain GAAP items that are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For additional information see Note 15.   ﻿   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   ﻿   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.    ﻿   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:    ﻿     ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products; the required amount of reserves and/or surplus; our ability to conduct business and our captive reinsurance arrangements as well as restrictions on the payment of revenue sharing and 12b‑1 distribution fees; the impact of recently enacted U.S. federal tax reform legislation on our business, earnings and capital; and the effect of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal’s decision vacating the Department of Labor’s fiduciary regulation as well as any “best interest” standards of care adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or other state regulators;    ·    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;     ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    48            ·    Uncertainty about the effect of continuing promulgation and implementation of rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on us, the economy and the financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products; a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products; an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”); and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including the successful implementation of integration strategies or the achievement of anticipated synergies and operational efficiencies related to an acquisition;    ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from evolving market preferences and the changing demographics of our client base; and    ·    The unanticipated loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.  ﻿   The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.    ﻿   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.    ﻿   INTRODUCTION   ﻿   Executive Summary    ﻿   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products primarily include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.   ﻿   We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2017 Form 10-K. We provide information about our segments’ and Other Operations’ operating revenue and expense line items and realized gain (loss), key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items below. As discussed in Note 3, on May 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Liberty Life, which operates a group benefits business and individual life and individual and group annuity business in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. We ceded insurance policies relating to individual life and individual and group annuity business to third-party reinsurers. The operating      49         results of Liberty Life are included in our Group Protection segment beginning on May 1, 2018. The acquisition enables us to increase our market share within the group protection marketplace. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q and below.   ﻿   Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   ﻿   The MD&A included in our 2017 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2017 Form 10-K, and therefore, should be read in conjunction with that disclosure.   ﻿   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   ﻿   ﻿   Unlocking   ﻿   As stated in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical   Accounting Policies and Estimates – Unlocking” in our 2017 Form 10-K, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the   assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life   insurance and annuity products in the third quarter of each year.    ﻿   Reversion to the Mean   ﻿   As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process, as discussed in our 2017 Form 10-K. If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of June 30, 2018, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $200 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $45 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance and approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services.   ﻿   Investments   ﻿   Investment Valuation    ﻿   The following summarizes our fixed maturity available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of June 30, 2018:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                                      ﻿        Quoted                                                          ﻿        Prices                                                          ﻿        in Active                                                          ﻿    Markets for    Significant    Significant                      ﻿        Identical        Observable    Unobservable                      ﻿        Assets            Inputs            Inputs            Total          ﻿        (Level 1)            (Level 2)            (Level 3)            Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  698 				           $  78,490 				           $     -            $  79,188 				         Priced by independent broker quotations             -                 -              1,093 				             1,093 				         Priced by matrices             -              12,188 				                -              12,188 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              2,596 				             2,596 				         Total        $  698 				           $  90,678 				           $  3,689 				           $  95,065 				         ﻿                                                                      Percent of total          1% 				             95% 				             4% 				             100% 				        ﻿   ﻿     (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.   ﻿   ﻿   For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2017 Form 10-K and Note 15 herein.    ﻿   Derivatives    ﻿   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿       50         Guaranteed Living Benefits   ﻿   Within our individual annuity business, 65% of our variable annuity account values contained guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) features as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. Underperforming equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features. A contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, 7% of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, was $475 million and $474 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.   ﻿   For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.    ﻿   For information on our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income (loss) that could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities, see our discussion in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – GLB” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿

Net income decreased due primarily to the following:   ﻿     ·    Losses on variable annuity net derivatives results.     ·    Acquisition and integration costs incurred as part of our recent acquisition and higher strategic digitization expense.    ·    Less favorable investment income on alternative investments and lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.    ·    No amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance in 2018 as the gain was fully amortized during the second quarter of 2017.    52            ·    Spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates.  ﻿   The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:   ﻿     ·    Growth in average account values and business in force.    ·    Lower federal income tax expense.    ·    The acquisition of Liberty Life effective May 1, 2018  ﻿   Additionally, when comparing the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 2017, the decrease in net income was also due to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt.   ﻿   ﻿       53            RESULTS OF ANNUITIES   ﻿   Income (Loss)

(3)    Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.  ﻿   Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 to 2017   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:   ﻿     ·    Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values.     ·    Lower federal income tax expense due to the change in the marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”).  ﻿   The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:   ﻿     ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by less favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio and lower prepayments and bond make-whole premiums.    ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher average account values, resulting in higher trail commissions.  ﻿   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 to 2017   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values.    ﻿   The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:   ﻿     ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to an increase in amortization expense as a result of higher actual gross profits and higher average account values, resulting in higher trail commissions.    ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by spread compression due to average new money rates trailing our current portfolio yields, less favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio and lower prepayments and bond make-whole premiums.    ·    Higher federal income tax expense in 2018 (see “Additional Information” below for more information).   ﻿       54            Additional Information   ﻿   For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the federal income tax expense was primarily impacted by the lower marginal corporate income tax rate and tax law changes to the separate account dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) as a result of the Tax Act and other items. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the federal income tax expense was driven by one-time and run-rate adjustments primarily associated with our separate account DRD.   ﻿   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations.    ﻿   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused by full surrenders, deaths and other contract benefits. These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.   ﻿   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A.

(2)    The prior year has been restated to conform to the current year presentation, which has been modified to be consistent across our business segments.    (3)    We generally use the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 index as a benchmark for the performance of our variable account values. The account values of our variable annuity contracts are invested by our policyholders in a variety of investment options including, but not limited to, domestic and international equity securities and fixed income, which do not necessarily align with S&P 500 index performance. See Note 8 for additional information.  ﻿   We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Fee income includes charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but excludes the attributed fees on our GLB riders; see “Part II – Item 7.

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account values caused primarily by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals. These outflows as a percentage of average account values were 10% and 11% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 10% and 12% for the corresponding periods in 2017.    ﻿   Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Net Flows By Market table below as “Multi-Fund® and other”), which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 24% and 27% as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.    ﻿   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”). For information on strategies we use to reduce the statutory reserve strain caused by XXX and AG38, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus” below.   ﻿   Additional Information   ﻿   During the second quarter of 2018, mortality was in line relative to our expectations for claims seasonality.   ﻿   For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Part II – Item 7A.

Both cost of insurance and expense assessments can have deferrals and amortization related to DFEL. Cost of insurance and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.    ﻿       65         Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.    ﻿   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:   ﻿     ·    MoneyGuard®, our linked-benefit product – 15% of total expected premium deposits;    ·    UL, IUL and VUL – first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received;    ·    Executive Benefits – single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits, and corporate-owned UL and VUL, first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received; and    ·    Term – 100% of annualized first-year premiums.  ﻿   We monitor the business environment, including but not limited to the regulatory and interest rate environments, and make changes to our product offerings and in-force products as needed, and as permitted under the terms of the policies, to sustain the future profitability of our segment.    ﻿   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   ﻿   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Net Investment Income                                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate                                                      and other, net of investment expenses    $  593 				       $  581 				       $  1,181 				       $  1,162 				         Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond                                                      make-whole premiums (1)      8 				         14 				         15 				         20 				         Alternative investments (2)      10 				         33 				         32 				         62 				         Surplus investments (3)      39 				         44 				         80 				         85 				         Total net investment income    $  650 				       $  672 				       $  1,308 				       $  1,329 				         ﻿                                                      Interest Credited    $  351 				       $  349 				       $  705 				       $  698 				        ﻿     (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements. These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿   Benefits   ﻿   Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Benefits                                                      Death claims direct and assumed    $  1,071 				       $  1,254 				       $  2,186 				       $  2,421 				         Death claims ceded      (424 				   )      (608 				   )      (830 				   )      (1,084 				   )      Reserves released on death      (145 				   )      (154 				   )      (311 				   )      (339 				   )      Net death benefits      502 				         492 				         1,045 				         998 				         Change in secondary guarantee life insurance product                                                       reserves      160 				         168 				         325 				         335 				         Change in MoneyGuard® reserves      95 				         76 				         184 				         145 				         Other benefits (1)      83 				         71 				         136 				         126 				         Total benefits    $  840 				       $  807 				       $  1,690 				       $  1,604 				         ﻿                                                      Death claims per $1,000 of in-force      2.76 				         2.81 				         2.88 				         2.86 				        ﻿     (1)    Includes primarily changes in reserves and dividends on traditional and other products.      67         Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves. These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments and benefits causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, to the corresponding periods in 2017, the increase was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with higher commission rates.       ﻿       68            RESULTS OF GROUP PROTECTION   ﻿   Income (Loss) from Operations   ﻿   Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three         For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended         Months Ended           ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Operating Revenues                                                      Insurance premiums    $  846 				       $  494 				       $  1,354 				       $  988 				         Net investment income      63 				         43 				         103 				         87 				         Other revenues (1)      28 				         4 				         33 				         7 				         Total operating revenues      937 				         541 				         1,490 				         1,082 				         Operating Expenses                                                      Interest credited      1 				            -          2 				         1 				         Benefits      617 				         326 				         943 				         676 				         Commissions and other expenses      262 				         162 				         451 				         341 				         Total operating expenses      880 				         488 				         1,396 				         1,018 				         Income (loss) from operations before taxes      57 				         53 				         94 				         64 				         Federal income tax expense (benefit)      12 				         18 				         20 				         22 				         Income (loss) from operations    $  45 				       $  35 				       $  74 				       $  42 				        ﻿   ﻿     (1)    Consists of revenue from third-parties for administrative services performed, which has a corresponding partial offset in commissions and other expenses.     ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Income (Loss) from Operations by Product Line                                                      Life    $  28 				       $  15 				       $  37 				       $  12 				         Disability      20 				         20 				         41 				         30 				         Dental      (3 				   )         -          (5 				   )         -          Total non-medical      45 				         35 				         73 				         42 				         Medical         -             -          1 				            -          Income (loss) from operations    $  45 				       $  35 				       $  74 				       $  42 				        ﻿   Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 to 2017   ﻿   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:   ﻿     ·    The acquisition of Liberty Life effective May 1, 2018 (see “Additional Information” below for more information).    ·    Lower federal income tax expense due to the change in the marginal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.  ﻿   The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher strategic investments to enhance our customer experience and improve efficiency.   ﻿   Additional Information   ﻿   Income from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, includes two months of activity from Liberty Life due to the acquisition closing on May 1, 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary – Significant Operational Matters – Strategic Digitization Initiative” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited    ﻿   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.   ﻿   Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the business segments and Other Operations.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for      72         this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   ﻿   Benefits   ﻿   Benefits are recognized when incurred for institutional pension products and disability income business.   ﻿   Other Expenses   ﻿   ﻿   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          General and administrative expenses:                                                      Legal    $     -        $     -        $  1 				       $     -          Branding      11 				         12 				         19 				         17 				         Other (1)      2 				         1 				         7 				         11 				         Total general and administrative expenses      13 				         13 				         27 				         28 				         Taxes, licenses and fees      (3 				   )      (2 				   )      (5 				   )      (4 				   )      Inter-segment reimbursement associated with reserve                                                      financing and LOC expenses (2)      (3 				   )      (3 				   )      (6 				   )      (6 				   )      Total other expenses    $  7 				       $  8 				       $  16 				       $  18 				        ﻿     (1)    Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, the portion of our deferred compensation plan expense attributable to participants’ selection of LNC stock as the measure for their investment return and other expenses not allocated to our business segments.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   ﻿   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.    ﻿   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   ﻿       76            Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   ﻿   We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, in 2018 that resulted in a new classification and measurement of our equity securities. See Note 2 for additional information. Fixed maturity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Details underlying our fixed maturity AFS securities by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.   ﻿      ﻿                                                              ﻿                                                              ﻿    As of June 30, 2018          ﻿                Gross Unrealized                    %          ﻿    Amortized                Losses and        Fair        Fair          ﻿    Cost        Gains        OTTI (1)        Value        Value          Fixed Maturity AFS Securities                                                              Industry corporate bonds:                                                              Financial services    $  12,897 				         530 				       $  260 				       $  13,167 				     14.1% 				         Basic industry      4,971 				         191 				         95 				         5,067 				     5.5% 				         Capital goods      6,470 				         293 				         126 				         6,637 				     7.1% 				         Communications      4,553 				         210 				         114 				         4,649 				     5.0% 				         Consumer cyclical      5,604 				         214 				         134 				         5,684 				     6.1% 				         Consumer non-cyclical      13,772 				         648 				         340 				         14,080 				     15.1% 				         Energy      6,472 				         296 				         135 				         6,633 				     7.1% 				         Technology      3,709 				         92 				         51 				         3,750 				     4.0% 				         Transportation      3,065 				         106 				         79 				         3,092 				     3.3% 				         Industrial other      1,164 				         27 				         26 				         1,165 				     1.3% 				         Utilities      12,956 				         835 				         165 				         13,626 				     14.7% 				         Government related entities      2,376 				         163 				         48 				         2,491 				     2.7% 				         Collateralized mortgage and other obligations ("CMOs"):                                                              Agency backed      1,658 				         47 				         71 				         1,634 				     1.8% 				         Non-agency backed      803 				         52 				         (21 				   )      876 				     0.9% 				         Mortgage pass through securities ("MPTS"):                                                              Agency backed      856 				         20 				         12 				         864 				     0.9% 				         Commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"):                                                              Agency backed      22 				            -

Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.    ﻿   The quality of our fixed maturity AFS securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                  ﻿                                                                                  ﻿        Rating Agency        As of June 30, 2018        As of December 31, 2017          NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of          Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total          ﻿                                                                                  Investment Grade Securities                                                                          1        AAA / AA / A        $  48,107 				       $  50,589 				     54.4% 				       $  46,455 				       $  51,494 				     54.3% 				         2        BBB          38,301 				         38,911 				     41.8% 				         36,703 				         39,518 				     41.7% 				         Total investment grade securities          86,408 				         89,500 				     96.2% 				         83,158 				         91,012 				     96.0% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                          3        BB          2,653 				         2,614 				     2.8% 				         2,785 				         2,840 				     3.0% 				         4        B          901 				         846 				     0.9% 				         768 				         743 				     0.8% 				         5        CCC and lower          112 				         85 				     0.1% 				         271 				         229 				     0.2% 				         6        In or near default          9 				         15 				     0.0% 				         11 				         16 				     0.0% 				         Total below investment grade securities          3,675 				         3,560 				     3.8% 				         3,835 				         3,828 				     4.0% 				         Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  90,083 				       $  93,060 				     100.0% 				       $  86,993 				       $  94,840 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                                  Total securities below investment                                                                          grade as a percentage of total                                                                          fixed maturity AFS securities          4.1% 				         3.8% 				                 4.4% 				         4.0% 				                ﻿     (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of June 30, 2018.   ﻿   Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).    ﻿   As of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, 95% and 88%, respectively, of the total fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position were investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on fixed maturity AFS securities as of June 30, 2018, increased by $1.3 billion since December 31, 2017. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2017 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2018, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.       79            In our evaluation of OTTI, we concluded: (i) that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (ii) that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:   ﻿     ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.  ﻿   To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:   ﻿     ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.   ﻿   As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $113.8 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $104.4 billion as of June 30, 2018. If it were necessary to liquidate fixed maturity AFS securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those fixed maturity AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $55.3 billion as of June 30, 2018, rather than selling fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point in time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business.    ﻿   See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 5 in our 2017 Form 10-K and Note 5 herein for additional discussion.   ﻿   As of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $15.2 billion, representing 14% and 13%, respectively, of total invested assets.   ﻿   Mortgage-Backed Securities (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2017 Form 10-K for a discussion of our mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”).    ﻿   Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $4.0 billion and a net unrealized gain of $93 million as of June 30, 2018.    ﻿       80            The market value of AFS and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $486 million and represented approximately 1% of our total investment portfolio as of June 30, 2018. AFS securities represented $480 million, or 99%, and trading securities represented $6 million, or 1%, of the subprime exposure as of June 30, 2018.

Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of securities in an unrealized loss position on our future earnings.    ﻿       82         The composition by industry categories of all securities in an unrealized loss position (in millions) as of June 30, 2018, was as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                  ﻿                                                                  ﻿                                            %          ﻿                                    Gross        Gross          ﻿            %                %        Unrealized        Unrealized          ﻿    Fair        Fair        Amortized        Amortized        Losses        Losses          ﻿    Value        Value        Cost        Cost        and OTTI        and OTTI          Banking    $  3,283 				     8.7% 				       $  3,430 				     8.7% 				       $  147 				     8.4% 				         Food and beverage      2,136 				     5.7% 				         2,255 				     5.7% 				         119 				     6.8% 				         Electric      2,704 				     7.1% 				         2,816 				     7.1% 				         112 				     6.4% 				         Pharmaceuticals      1,704 				     4.5% 				         1,796 				     4.6% 				         92 				     5.3% 				         Chemicals      1,738 				     4.6% 				         1,815 				     4.6% 				         77 				     4.4% 				         Healthcare      1,728 				     4.6% 				         1,805 				     4.6% 				         77 				     4.4% 				         Diversified manufacturing      1,446 				     3.8% 				         1,510 				     3.8% 				         64 				     3.7% 				         Technology      1,874 				     5.0% 				         1,925 				     4.9% 				         51 				     2.9% 				         Media – entertainment      834 				     2.2% 				         883 				     2.3% 				         49 				     2.8% 				         Midstream      959 				     2.5% 				         1,001 				     2.5% 				         42 				     2.4% 				         Transportation services      1,155 				     3.1% 				         1,197 				     3.0% 				         42 				     2.4% 				         Independent      909 				     2.4% 				         950 				     2.4% 				         41 				     2.3% 				         Retailers      753 				     2.0% 				         792 				     2.0% 				         39 				     2.2% 				         MBS      417 				     1.1% 				         454 				     1.1% 				         37 				     2.1% 				         Property and casualty      668 				     1.8% 				         703 				     1.8% 				         35 				     2.0% 				         Railroads      488 				     1.3% 				         523 				     1.3% 				         35 				     2.0% 				         Oil field services      296 				     0.8% 				         328 				     0.8% 				         32 				     1.8% 				         Life      574 				     1.5% 				         605 				     1.5% 				         31 				     1.8% 				         Consumer products      566 				     1.5% 				         597 				     1.5% 				         31 				     1.8% 				         Industries with unrealized losses                                                                  less than $30 million      13,525 				     35.8% 				         14,122 				     35.8% 				         597 				     34.1% 				         Total by industry    $  37,757 				     100.0% 				       $  39,507 				     100.0% 				       $  1,750 				     100.0% 				         ﻿                                                                  Total by industry as a percentage                                                                  of total AFS securities      40.6% 				                 43.9% 				                 100.0% 				                ﻿   As of June 30, 2018, the fair value and amortized cost of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss position was $96 million and $124 million, respectively.    ﻿   Mortgage Loans on Real Estate   ﻿   The following tables summarize key information on mortgage loans on real estate (in millions):   ﻿      ﻿                                              ﻿                                              ﻿    As of June 30, 2018        As of December 31, 2017          ﻿    Carrying                Carrying                  ﻿    Value        %        Value        %          Credit Quality Indicator                                              Current    $  12,213 				     100.0% 				       $  10,760 				     100.0% 				         Delinquent (1)      2 				     0.0% 				            -      0.0% 				         Foreclosure (2)      2 				     0.0% 				         2 				     0.0% 				         Total mortgage loans on real estate    $  12,217 				     100.0% 				       $  10,762 				     100.0% 				        ﻿     (1)    As of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, there were 12 and zero mortgage loans on real estate that were delinquent, respectively.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   ﻿   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums   ﻿   Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   ﻿   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   ﻿   Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Fixed maturity AFS securities: (1)                                                      Gross gains    $  1 				       $  3 				       $  16 				       $  11 				         Gross losses      (12 				   )      (13 				   )      (45 				   )      (25 				   )      Equity AFS securities:                                                      Gross gains         -             -             -          1 				         Gain (loss) on other investments (2)      4 				         (2 				   )      6 				         (5 				   )      Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                                      DSI and DFEL and changes in                                                       other contract holder funds      (6 				   )      (6 				   )      (11 				   )      (13 				   )      Total realized gain (loss) related to                                                       certain investments, pre-tax    $  (13 				   )    $  (18 				   )    $  (34 				   )    $  (31 				   )     ﻿     (1)    These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity. See Note 6 for more information.    (2)    Includes market adjustments on equity securities still held of $2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.  ﻿   Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual      86         versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses.   ﻿   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2018 and 2017, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.    ﻿   We consider economic factors and circumstances within industries and countries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the position of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   ﻿   When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Write-downs for OTTI and Allowance for Losses” in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.   ﻿   Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          OTTI Recognized in Net Income (Loss)                                                      Fixed maturity AFS securities:                                                      Corporate bonds    $  (1 				   )    $  (4 				   )    $  (3 				   )    $  (5 				   )      ABS         -             -             -          (1 				   )      RMBS         -             -             -          (1 				   )      State and municipal bonds         -             -             -          (1 				   )      Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)      (1 				   )      (4 				   )      (3 				   )      (8 				   )      Associated amortization of DAC,                                                      VOBA, DSI and DFEL         -             -             -             -          Net OTTI recognized in net income                                                      (loss), pre-tax    $  (1 				   )    $  (4 				   )    $  (3 				   )    $  (8 				   )     ﻿   The $3 million of impairments recognized in net income taken during the first six months of 2018 were all credit-related impairments. The decrease in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first six months of 2018 to the corresponding period in 2017 was primarily attributable to the stabilization of certain corporate and municipal bond holdings as well as gradual recovery of RMBS and ABS investments. We recognized less than $1 million of OTTI in OCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.   ﻿       87            REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   ﻿   Liquidity and Capital Resources   ﻿   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   ﻿   ﻿   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $632 million and $202 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.    ﻿   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.    ﻿   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Dividends from Subsidiaries                                                      The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company    $     -        $  244 				       $     -        $  454 				         First Penn-Pacific         -          20 				            -          20 				         Lincoln National Management Corporation         -             -             -          65 				         Total dividends from subsidiaries    $     -        $  264 				       $     -        $  539 				         ﻿                                                      Loan Repayments and Interest from Subsidiaries                                                      Interest on inter-company notes    $  30 				       $  29 				       $  61 				       $  80 				         ﻿                                                      Other Cash Flow Items                                                      Amounts received from (paid for taxes on)                                                       stock option exercises and restricted stock, net    $  1 				       $  4 				       $  2 				       $  42 				        ﻿   The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company. For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay without prior approval, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Restrictions on Dividends from Subsidiaries” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Insurance Subsidiaries’ Statutory Capital and Surplus   ﻿   Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. Our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to XXX and AG38, respectively. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory, and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations” in our 2017 Form 10-K, our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to insurance captives. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner. We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. Included in the LOCs issued as of June 30, 2018, was approximately $2.3 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($350 million will expire in 2019 and $1.9 billion relates to arrangements that will expire by 2031). For information on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in Note 12 in our 2017 Form 10-K. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have also issued long-term notes of $3.1 billion to finance a portion of the excess reserves as of June 30, 2018; of this amount, $2.0 billion involve exposure to VIEs. For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 4 in our 2017 Form 10-K.      88         We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. An inability to obtain appropriate capital market solutions could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. However, we believe that we have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available.   ﻿   Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company. The NAIC’s adoption of the new Valuation Manual that defines a principles-based reserving framework for newly issued life insurance policies was effective January 1, 2017. Principles-based reserving places a greater weight on our past experience and anticipated future experience as well as considers current economic conditions in calculating life insurance product reserves in accordance with statutory accounting principles. We adopted the new framework for our newly issued term business in 2017 and will phase in the framework prior to January 1, 2020, for all other newly issued life insurance products. We believe that these changes may reduce our future use of captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries for reserve financing transactions for our life insurance business. For more information on principles-based reserving, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Statutory reserves established for variable annuity contracts and riders are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and are affected by the level of account values relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We also utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements to manage our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups continues to evaluate the adequacy of existing NAIC model regulations with a focus on targeted improvements to the statutory reserving and accounting framework for variable annuities.   ﻿   We continue to analyze the use of our existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and our current hedging strategies relative to managing the effects of equity markets and interest rates on the statutory reserves, statutory capital and the dividend capacity of our life insurance subsidiaries.   ﻿   Financing Activities   ﻿   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.    ﻿   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.    ﻿   Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) for the six months ended June 30, 2018, were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                                                          ﻿          ﻿                            Maturities,        Change                                      ﻿                            Repayments        in Fair                                      ﻿    Beginning                     and         Value            Other            Ending      ﻿    Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt    $  450 				       $     -            $  (450 				   )        $     -            $     -            $     -      ﻿                                                                                          Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,687 				       $  1,100 				           $  (287 				   )        $  (76 				   )        $  (5 				   )        $  4,419 				     Bank borrowing (2)         -          200 				                -                 -                 -              200 				     Capital securities (3)      1,207 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,207 				     Total long-term debt    $  4,894 				       $  1,300 				           $  (287 				   )        $  (76 				   )        $  (5 				   )        $  5,826 				    ﻿     (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion (amortization) of discounts and premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs, as applicable.     (2)    We refinanced a $250 million floating rate loan that was scheduled to mature on June 6, 2018, into a $200 million floating rate loan maturing on June 6, 2023.    (3)    To hedge the variability in rates, we have purchased forward starting interest rate swaps to lock in a fixed rate of approximately 5% over the remaining terms of the capital securities.  ﻿   On February 12, 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of $150 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due 2023 and $450 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.35% senior notes due 2048. We used these proceeds to repurchase $200 million of our 7.00% senior notes due 2018 and $287 million of our 8.75% senior notes due 2019. In addition, on February 12, 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.80% senior notes due 2028. We used these proceeds, together with cash on hand and other arrangements, to fund our recent acquisition as described in Note 3. As of June 30, 2018,      89         the holding company had available liquidity of $484 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.    ﻿   For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Notes 12 and 24 in our 2017 Form 10-K as updated by Note 9 in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q.   ﻿   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.   ﻿   If current credit ratings or claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event with respect to LNC if its long-term senior debt ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s); or with respect to Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) if its financial strength ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of June 30, 2018. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2017 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.   ﻿   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2017 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.   ﻿   Alternative Sources of Liquidity   ﻿   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of June 30, 2018, the holding company had a net outstanding receivable (payable) of $125 million from (to) certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed (borrowed) by the holding company and subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.   ﻿   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. Our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”). Membership allows LNL access to the FHLBI’s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets, agency securities or U.S. Treasury securities. LNL had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $5.0 billion under the FHLBI facility as of June 30, 2018. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBI’s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LNL. As of June 30, 2018, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $4.2 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 5.   ﻿   Cash Flows from Collateral on Derivatives   ﻿   Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset decreases (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability decreases (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decrease (or increase). During 2018, our collateral payable for derivative investments decreased due primarily to increasing interest rates that decreased the fair values of our associated derivative investments. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have liquidity sources, as discussed above, to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 6.   ﻿       90            Uses of Capital   ﻿   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders, to repurchase our stock and to repay debt.    ﻿   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders    ﻿   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.    ﻿   Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Dividends to common stockholders    $  72 				       $  65 				       $  144 				       $  131 				         Repurchase of common stock      100 				         200 				         100 				         400 				         Total cash returned to stockholders    $  172 				       $  265 				       $  244 				       $  531 				         ﻿                                                      Number of shares repurchased      1.456 				         3.030 				         1.456 				         5.894 				         Average price per share    $  68.71 				       $  68.00 				       $  68.71 				       $  68.90 				        ﻿   On October 31, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.29 to $0.33 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2018 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.   ﻿   Other Uses of Capital   ﻿   In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:   ﻿      ﻿                                                      ﻿                                                      ﻿    For the Three        For the Six          ﻿    Months Ended        Months Ended          ﻿    June 30,        June 30,          ﻿    2018        2017        2018        2017          Debt service (interest paid)    $  69 				       $  64 				       $  141 				       $  126 				         Capital contribution to subsidiaries      500 				            -          502 				         60 				         Total    $  569 				       $  64 				       $  643 				       $  186 				        ﻿   The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   ﻿   We made an investment in our Group business through our acquisition of Liberty Life, a subsidiary of LNL, which impacted our liquidity and capital position. For additional information on our acquisition, see “Introduction – Executive Summary” above and Note 3 herein.   ﻿   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   ﻿   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q and below.       91         For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 Form 10-K as updated by “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q and below.   ﻿   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    ﻿   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. As of June 30, 2018, there have been no material changes in our economic exposure to these market risks since December 31, 2017. For information on these market risks, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2017 Form 10-K.   ﻿   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   ﻿   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures    ﻿   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   ﻿   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    ﻿   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We acquired Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston (“Liberty Life”) on May 1, 2018, and have not yet included Liberty Life in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, pursuant to the SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures does not include Liberty Life. See Note 3 for additional information.   ﻿   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.    ﻿       92            PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ﻿   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   ﻿   Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 10 in “Part I – Item 1.”   ﻿   Item 1A. Risk Factors   ﻿   Legislative, Regulatory and Tax   ﻿   Federal Regulation   ﻿   Standard of Conduct regulations could cause changes to the manner in which we deliver products and services as well as changes in nature and amount of compensation and fees.   ﻿   In 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) released the DOL Fiduciary Rule, which became effective on June 9, 2017, and substantially expanded the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. On March 15, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the “Fifth Circuit”) issued an opinion in the case Chamber of Commerce v. the U.S. Department of Labor vacating the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related applicable exemptions. The DOL and the Department of Justice did not appeal the Fifth Circuit’s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on June 21, 2018, the Fifth Circuit issued a mandate stating that the original definition of “fiduciary,” including the original five-part test, will apply going forward.    ﻿   On April 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) proposed “Regulation Best Interest,” a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would require a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction, without putting its financial interests ahead of the interests of a retail customer. The proposed rule includes guidance on what constitutes a “recommendation” and a definition of who would be a “retail customer” in addition to provisions setting forth certain required disclosures, policies and procedures to identify conflicts of interest, and customer-specific best interest obligations.    In addition, the SEC proposed the use of a new disclosure document, the customer or client relationship summary, or Form CRS. Form CRS is intended to provide retail investors with information about the nature of their relationship with their investment professional, and would supplement other more detailed disclosures, including existing Form ADV for advisors and the new disclosures under Regulation Best Interest for broker dealers.    Finally, the SEC proposed interpretative guidance providing clarity on an investment adviser’s fiduciary obligation under the Advisers Act. The guidance indicates that investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to their clients that includes both a duty of care and a duty of loyalty and provides additional clarification of an investment adviser’s responsibilities under these fiduciary duties. Investment advisers and broker-dealers would also need to disclose their registration status with the SEC in certain retail investor communications. The comment period on the proposals is expected to close on August 7, 2018.   In addition to the SEC proposed rules, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and several states, including Connecticut, Nevada, New Jersey and New York have passed laws or proposed regulations requiring investment advisers, broker-dealers and/or agents to disclose conflicts of interest to clients or to meet standards that their advice be in the customer’s best interest. These recent developments could result in additional requirements related to the sale of our products.    It is uncertain at this point, how the original DOL definition of “fiduciary” will work in conjunction with any final rules adopted by the SEC, the NAIC or any individual state. While we continue to monitor and evaluate the various proposals, we cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what legislation or regulation may be introduced or become law. Therefore, until such time as final rules or laws are in place, the potential impact on our business is uncertain.   ﻿       93            Item 2.
