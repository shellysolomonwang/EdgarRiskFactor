Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed in 2013; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2013.        In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.       Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.        FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE       Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.        Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:          ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements related to secondary guarantee universal life and annuities; regulations regarding captive reinsurance arrangements; restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b‑1 payments; and the potential for U.S. federal tax reform;    ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on us and the economy and the financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    41          ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    ·    The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and    ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.        Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.        INTRODUCTION       Executive Summary        We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit universal life, indexed UL, term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.       We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2012 Form 10-K.        For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.       Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2012 Form 10-K.        For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.           42          Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The MD&A included in our 2012 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2012 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K.       DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL       Unlocking       During the third quarter, we will conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. See “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1 of our 2012 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our unlocking process.        Reversion to the Mean (“RTM”)       As equity markets do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our RTM process, as discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K.        Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate drop of approximately 12% followed by growth going forward of 7.5% to 9% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed income and equity-type investments. If we were to have unlocked our RTM assumption in the corridor as of June 30, 2013, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $235 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.       Investments       Investment Valuation        The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of June 30, 2013:                                                                                                                                                                 Quoted                                                           Prices                                                           in Active                                                           Markets for    Significant    Significant                           Identical    Observable    Unobservable                           Assets    Inputs    Inputs        Total               (Level 1)    (Level 2)    (Level 3)        Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  593 				           $  68,885 				           $     -            $  69,478 				         Priced by independent broker                                                                      quotations             -                 -              2,839 				             2,839 				         Priced by matrices             -              11,553 				                -              11,553 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              1,346 				             1,346 				         Total        $  593 				           $  80,438 				           $  4,185 				           $  85,216 				                                                                                Percent of total          1% 				             94% 				             5% 				             100% 				              (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.       For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2012 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.       As of June 30, 2013, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are      43       generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2013, we used broker quotes for 55 securities as our final price source, representing approximately 1% of total securities owned.        Derivatives        Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       Guaranteed Living Benefits (“GLB”)       Within our individual annuity business, approximately 72% of our variable annuity account values contained GLB features as of June 30, 2013. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, 6% and 14%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, was $480 million and $755 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.       For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.            The following table presents our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to realized gain (loss), which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities (in millions) at the levels indicated in the table and excludes the net cost of operating the hedging program. The amounts represent the estimated difference between the change in the portion of GLB reserves that is calculated on a fair value basis and the change in the value of the underlying hedge instruments after the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and taxes. These effects do not include any estimate of unlocking that could occur, nor do they estimate any change in the NPR component of the GLB reserve or any estimate of effects to our GLB benefit ratio unlocking. These estimates are based upon the recorded reserves as of June 28, 2013, and the related hedge instruments in place as of that date. The effects presented in the table below are not representative of the aggregate impacts that could result if a combination of such changes to equity market returns, interest rates and implied volatilities occurred.

Acquisitions and Dispositions       The loss from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2012, related to a purchase price adjustment associated with the termination of a portion of the investment advisory agreement with Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., our former subsidiary.

   ·    Spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates; and    ·    Higher death claims.      The decrease in net income was partially offset by growth in account values, insurance in force and group earned premiums.       During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, we experienced better than expected commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums (see “Consolidated Investments – Net Investment Income” for additional information).

(2)    See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.    (3)    Consists primarily of fees attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 to 2012       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to higher insurance fees driven by higher average daily variable account values (see the “Account Value Information” table within “Insurance Fees” below for drivers of changes in our account values).           46       The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher account values driving higher trail commissions, partially offset by higher average equity markets than our model projections assumed resulting in a lower amortization rate.       Additional Information       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. We continue to monitor the marketplace and economic environment and make changes to our product offerings as needed to sustain the future profitability of our segment. In 2012, these changes included the introduction of risk-managed fund strategies, reductions to withdrawal rates for several guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) riders, closure of the bonus share class variable annuity contracts, and targeted commission reductions for certain fixed indexed annuity products. For example, risk-managed fund strategies drove over 75% of variable annuity deposits in the second quarter of 2013.       The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 7% and 8% for the corresponding periods in 2012.        Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” in our 2012 Form 10-K for discussion of these attributed fees.           48          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited       Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Net Investment Income                                                                  Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                                                   on real estate and other, net of                                                                   investment expenses    $  222 				       $  237 				       -6%        $  449 				       $  475 				       -5%      Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                                                   and bond make-whole premiums (1)      18 				         4 				       NM          22 				         6 				     267% 				     Alternative investments (2)         -             -        NM             -          1 				       -100%      Surplus investments (3)      33 				         38 				       -13%          59 				         69 				       -14%      Total net investment income    $  273 				       $  279 				       -2%        $  530 				       $  551 				       -4%                                                                         Interest Credited                                                                  Amount provided to contract holders    $  150 				       $  163 				       -8%        $  294 				       $  329 				       -11%      DSI deferrals      (2) 				         (10) 				     80% 				         (5) 				         (18) 				     72% 				     Interest credited before DSI                                                                  amortization      148 				         153 				       -3%          289 				         311 				       -7%      DSI amortization      9 				         10 				       -10%          21 				         22 				       -5%      Total interest credited    $  157 				       $  163 				       -4%        $  310 				       $  333 				       -7%           (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.       Benefits       Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking. In addition, see footnote 1 under the “Income (Loss) from Operations” table above for a discussion of the increase in benefits.           50          Commissions and Other Expenses        Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Commissions and Other Expenses                                                                  Commissions:                                                                  Deferrable    $  188 				       $  132 				     42% 				       $  330 				       $  243 				     36% 				     Non-deferrable      86 				         70 				     23% 				         173 				         142 				     22% 				     General and administrative expenses      106 				         96 				     10% 				         200 				         193 				     4% 				     Inter-segment reimbursement associated                                                                   with reserve financing and                                                                   LOC expenses (1)         -             -        NM          1 				            -        NM      Taxes, licenses and fees      6 				         6 				     0% 				         16 				         14 				     14% 				     Total expenses incurred, excluding                                                                  broker-dealer      386 				         304 				     27% 				         720 				         592 				     22% 				     DAC deferrals      (213) 				         (149) 				       -43%          (376) 				         (273) 				       -38%      Total pre-broker-dealer expenses                                                                  incurred, excluding amortization,                                                                  net of interest      173 				         155 				     12% 				         344 				         319 				     8% 				     DAC and VOBA amortization, net                                                                   of interest:                                                                  Unlocking         -             -        NM          2 				            -        NM      Amortization, net of interest,                                                                  excluding unlocking      92 				         86 				     7% 				         194 				         184 				     5% 				     Broker-dealer expenses incurred      90 				         85 				     6% 				         180 				         175 				     3% 				     Total commissions and other                                                                   expenses    $  355 				       $  326 				     9% 				       $  720 				       $  678 				     6% 				                                                                        DAC Deferrals                                                                  As a percentage of sales/deposits      5.1% 				         5.2% 				                 5.1% 				         5.1% 				                  (1)    Represents reimbursements to Annuities from the Life Insurance segment for reserve financing, net of expenses incurred by Annuities for its use of letters of credit (“LOCs”). The inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).      Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.       Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.           51       RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                 For the Six                   Months Ended                 Months Ended                    June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Operating Revenues                                                                  Insurance fees    $  58 				       $  53 				     9% 				       $  114 				       $  105 				     9% 				     Net investment income      211 				         202 				     4% 				         413 				         399 				     4% 				     Other revenues and fees (1)      2 				         3 				       -33%          4 				         6 				       -33%      Total operating revenues      271 				         258 				     5% 				         531 				         510 				     4% 				     Operating Expenses                                                                  Interest credited      117 				         112 				     4% 				         233 				         223 				     4% 				     Benefits         -             -        NM          1 				            -        NM      Commissions and other expenses      100 				         96 				     4% 				         195 				         190 				     3% 				     Total operating expenses      217 				         208 				     4% 				         429 				         413 				     4% 				     Income (loss) from operations before                                                                  taxes      54 				         50 				     8% 				         102 				         97 				     5% 				     Federal income tax expense (benefit)      15 				         12 				     25% 				         27 				         24 				     13% 				     Income (loss) from operations    $  39 				       $  38 				     3% 				       $  75 				       $  73 				     3% 				          (1)    Consists primarily of mutual fund account program fees for mid to large employers.      Comparison of the Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 to 2012       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:         ·    Higher insurance fees driven by higher average daily account values (see the “Account Value Information” table within “Insurance Fees” below for drivers of changes in our account values); and    ·    Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by:    §    Higher average fixed account values (see the “Other Information” table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our account values); and    §    Higher prepayment and bond make-whole premiums (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for more information).  partially offset by:     §    Spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher account values driving higher trail commissions.        Additional Information       We expect to continue making strategic investments during 2013 to improve our infrastructure and expand distribution that will result in higher expenses.        Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year, and we expect this trend will continue during 2013.       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 11% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 11% and 12% for the corresponding periods in 2012.        Our lapse rate is negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Total Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of their surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 34% and 38% as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due      52       to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.       Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

We charge expense assessments to cover insurance and administrative expenses. Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

Certain of our commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. Distribution expenses associated with the sale of mutual fund products are expensed as incurred. When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, to the corresponding periods in 2012, the decrease is primarily a result of incurred deferrable commissions declining at a rate higher than sales due to changes in sales mix to products with lower commission rates.

Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 to 2012       Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:         ·    Higher benefits due to higher death claims; and    ·    Higher commissions and other expenses attributable to the effect of favorable unlocking during 2012.      The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by higher insurance fees due to growth in business in force.        Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain       Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk-based capital (“RBC”) levels above current regulatory required levels. Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”), respectively. On September 12, 2012, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted revisions to AG38. Effective as of December 31, 2012, reserves on in-force business written between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, are subject to a minimum floor calculation. This floor calculation is based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the principles-based reserving framework developed by the NAIC. The AG38 revisions did not have a material impact on our total in-force reserves as of adoption. Reserves on new business written after December 31, 2012, are calculated using a modified formulaic approach. This approach results in higher reserves that exceed expected economic levels, which increases the surplus strain related to new sales. However, our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the surplus strain of holding the higher statutory reserves associated with term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. As noted below, we have been successful in executing reinsurance solutions to release surplus to Other Operations. We will continue to manage our present reinsurance solutions and enter into new solutions to minimize the strain on our surplus.       Included in the LOCs issued as of June 30, 2013, was approximately $2.8 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements. Approximately $1.7 billion of such LOCs that will expire in 2031 were issued for UL products containing secondary guarantees. Approximately $1.1 billion of such LOCs were issued for term business solutions (approximately $175 million will expire in 2018 and approximately $885 million will expire in 2023). We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of approximately $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital effect of term and UL products containing secondary guarantees. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could affect our returns on our in-force term and UL products containing secondary guarantees. However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures are not available.

Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2012 Form 10-K for further information on XXX and AG38 reserves. See the table in “Commissions and Other Expenses” below for the presentation of our expenses associated with reserve financing.       Additional Information       We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.        For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.        We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.           58       Insurance Premiums       Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.        Insurance Fees       Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Insurance Fees                                                                  Mortality assessments    $  336 				       $  329 				     2% 				       $  667 				       $  663 				     1% 				     Expense assessments      218 				         204 				     7% 				         431 				         409 				     5% 				     Surrender charges      15 				         20 				       -25%          31 				         43 				       -28%      DFEL:                                                                  Deferrals      (75) 				         (82) 				     9% 				         (152) 				         (165) 				     8% 				     Amortization, net of interest:                                                                  Unlocking         -             -        NM             -          (6) 				     100% 				     Amortization, net of interest,                                                                   excluding unlocking      40 				         39 				     3% 				         89 				         90 				       -1%      Total insurance fees    $  534 				       $  510 				     5% 				       $  1,066 				       $  1,034 				     3% 				                                                                                                                                                              For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Sales by Product                                                                  UL:                                                                  Excluding MoneyGuard® and indexed UL    $  30 				       $  41 				       -27%        $  60 				       $  81 				       -26%      MoneyGuard®      48 				         41 				     17% 				         94 				         82 				     15% 				     Indexed UL      11 				         10 				     10% 				         20 				         17 				     18% 				     Total UL      89 				         92 				       -3%          174 				         180 				       -3%      VUL      32 				         12 				     167% 				         55 				         21 				     162% 				     COLI and BOLI      39 				         11 				     255% 				         65 				         22 				     195% 				     Term      23 				         13 				     77% 				         39 				         26 				     50% 				     Total sales    $  183 				       $  128 				     43% 				       $  333 				       $  249 				     34% 				                                                                        Net Flows                                                                  Deposits    $  1,253 				       $  1,137 				     10% 				       $  2,494 				       $  2,297 				     9% 				     Withdrawals and deaths      (364) 				         (424) 				     14% 				         (758) 				         (843) 				     10% 				     Net flows    $  889 				       $  713 				     25% 				       $  1,736 				       $  1,454 				     19% 				                                                                        Contract Holder Assessments    $  861 				       $  800 				     8% 				       $  1,689 				       $  1,605 				     5% 				                                                                                                      As of June 30,                       2013        2012        Change          Account Values                                      UL    $  30,025 				       $  28,607 				     5% 				         VUL      6,157 				         5,230 				     18% 				         Interest-sensitive whole life      2,264 				         2,284 				       -1%          Total account values    $  38,446 				       $  36,121 				     6% 				                                                In-Force Face Amount                                      UL and other    $  314,093 				       $  308,763 				     2% 				         Term insurance      286,939 				         273,305 				     5% 				         Total in-force face amount    $  601,032 				       $  582,068 				     3% 				                59       Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.        Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:         ·    MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of single premium deposits;    ·    MoneyGuard® (flexible premium option), UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”)) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and    ·    Term – 100% of annualized first year premiums.      UL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 15% and 16% of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared to approximately 30% for the corresponding periods in 2012. Changes in the marketplace and continuing efforts to increase sales of higher return products (i.e., pivot products) in a low interest rate environment are resulting in a shift in our business mix to products like VUL, indexed UL and term that are not primarily focused upon secondary guarantees.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements. These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.           61          Benefits       Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Benefits                                                                  Death claims direct and assumed    $  769 				       $  777 				       -1%        $  1,634 				       $  1,580 				     3% 				     Death claims ceded      (348) 				         (370) 				     6% 				         (753) 				         (785) 				     4% 				     Reserves released on death      (128) 				         (136) 				     6% 				         (267) 				         (242) 				       -10%      Net death benefits      293 				         271 				     8% 				         614 				         553 				     11% 				     Change in secondary guarantee life                                                                   insurance product reserves:                                                                  Unlocking         -             -        NM             -          9 				       -100%      Change in reserves, excluding                                                                   unlocking      116 				         126 				       -8%          248 				         245 				     1% 				     Other benefits (1)      91 				         77 				     18% 				         143 				         136 				     5% 				     Total benefits    $  500 				       $  474 				     5% 				       $  1,005 				       $  943 				     7% 				                                                                        Death claims per $1,000 of in-force      1.96 				         1.87 				     5% 				         2.06 				         1.91 				     8% 				          (1)    Includes primarily traditional product changes in reserves and dividends.      Benefits for this segment includes claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business. When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, to the corresponding periods in 2012, the decrease is primarily a result of incurred deferrable commissions declining at a rate higher than sales due to changes in sales mix to products with lower commission rates.

The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products.        Additional Information       Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. For every one      63       percent increase in the loss ratio above our expectation, we would expect an approximate annual $11 million to $13 million decrease to income from operations.        We are evaluating the potential effects that health care reform may have on the value and profitability of this segment’s products and income from operations, including, but not limited to, potential changes to traditional sources of income for our brokers who may seek additional portfolio options and/or modification to compensation structures.       For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.        We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.        Net Investment Income       We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.           64          Benefits and Interest Credited       Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows:                                                                                                                                                         For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Benefits and Interest Credited by                                                                  Product Line                                                                  Life    $  162 				       $  143 				     13% 				       $  326 				       $  289 				     13% 				     Disability      156 				         142 				     10% 				         307 				         281 				     9% 				     Dental      37 				         36 				     3% 				         77 				         74 				     4% 				     Total non-medical      355 				         321 				     11% 				         710 				         644 				     10% 				     Medical      43 				         48 				       -10%          72 				         76 				       -5%      Total benefits and interest credited     $  398 				       $  369 				     8% 				       $  782 				       $  720 				     9% 				                                                                        Loss Ratios by Product Line                                                                  Life      77.1% 				         75.0% 				                 78.6% 				         76.6% 				             Disability      70.1% 				         69.6% 				                 69.6% 				         69.8% 				             Dental      74.1% 				         76.5% 				                 75.7% 				         79.2% 				             Total non-medical      73.5% 				         72.7% 				                 74.1% 				         73.8% 				             Medical      88.8% 				         89.7% 				                 89.0% 				         88.9% 				                Commissions and Other Expenses        Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                         For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Commissions and Other Expenses                                                                  Commissions    $  62 				       $  53 				     17% 				       $  125 				       $  107 				     17% 				     General and administrative expenses      77 				         69 				     12% 				         144 				         130 				     11% 				     Taxes, licenses and fees      13 				         13 				     0% 				         26 				         25 				     4% 				     Total expenses incurred      152 				         135 				     13% 				         295 				         262 				     13% 				     DAC deferrals      (18) 				         (17) 				       -6%          (33) 				         (28) 				       -18%      Total expenses recognized before                                                                  amortization      134 				         118 				     14% 				         262 				         234 				     12% 				     DAC and VOBA amortization, net of                                                                  interest      9 				         11 				       -18%          24 				         23 				     4% 				     Total commissions and                                                                  other expenses    $  143 				       $  129 				     11% 				       $  286 				       $  257 				     11% 				                                                                        DAC Deferrals                                                                  As a percentage of insurance premiums      3.4% 				         3.4% 				                 3.2% 				         2.9% 				                Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized in relation to the revenue of the related contracts.

The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.            65          RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                         For the Three                 For the Six                   Months Ended                 Months Ended                    June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Operating Revenues                                                                  Insurance premiums    $     -        $  3 				       -100%        $  1 				       $  4 				       -75%      Net investment income      63 				         68 				       -7%          129 				         137 				       -6%      Amortization of deferred gain on                                                                  business sold through reinsurance      18 				         18 				     0% 				         36 				         36 				     0% 				     Media revenues (net)      19 				         21 				       -10%          35 				         38 				       -8%      Other revenues and fees      2 				         3 				       -33%          2 				         4 				       -50%      Total operating revenues      102 				         113 				       -10%          203 				         219 				       -7%      Operating Expenses                                                                  Interest credited      28 				         30 				       -7%          55 				         61 				       -10%      Benefits      29 				         35 				       -17%          56 				         63 				       -11%      Media expenses      15 				         16 				       -6%          29 				         32 				       -9%      Other expenses      26 				         15 				     73% 				         52 				         36 				     44% 				     Interest and debt expense      65 				         68 				       -4%          129 				         135 				       -4%      Total operating expenses      163 				         164 				       -1%          321 				         327 				       -2%      Income (loss) from operations before                                                                  taxes      (61) 				         (51) 				       -20%          (118) 				         (108) 				       -9%      Federal income tax expense (benefit)      (21) 				         (12) 				       -75%          (41) 				         (35) 				       -17%      Income (loss) from operations    $  (40) 				       $  (39) 				       -3%        $  (77) 				       $  (73) 				       -5%         Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 to 2012       Loss from operations for Other Operations increased due primarily to growth in other expenses driven by an increase in our stock price and its effect on our deferred compensation plans (see “Other Expenses” below for more information), partially offset by lower interest and debt expense driven by a decline in both average balances of outstanding debt and rates.        Additional Information       We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.        Net Investment Income and Interest Credited        We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.       Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an effect on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.           66       Benefits       Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.

Interest and Debt Expense       Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”        Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 to 2012        We had realized losses during 2013 as compared to gains during 2012 driven primarily by the following components of excluded realized gain (loss), which we have described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax:         ·    Losses on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2013 attributable primarily to an unfavorable GLB NPR component due to our associated reserves declining (see “Variable Annuity Net Derivative Results” below for more discussion) along with the widening of our spreads, partially offset by less volatile capital markets resulting in favorable hedge program performance.      The realized losses were partially offset by the following:         ·    Lower gross realized losses related to certain investments during 2013 originating from asset sales to reposition the investment portfolio; and    ·    General improvement in the credit markets during 2013 leading to a decline in OTTI.      68       Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 to 2012        We had higher realized losses during 2013 as compared to 2012 driven primarily by the following components of excluded realized gain (loss), which we have described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax:         ·    Higher losses on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2013 attributable to a narrowing of our credit spreads during 2013 resulting in an unfavorable GLB NPR component, partially offset by less volatile capital markets during 2013 resulting in favorable hedge program performance; and    ·    Losses on the mark-to-market on certain instruments during 2013 attributable primarily to an increase in interest rates leading to a decrease in the value of our trading securities.       The higher realized losses were partially offset by the following:         ·    Lower gross realized losses related to certain investments during 2013 originating from asset sales to reposition the investment portfolio; and    ·    General improvement in the credit markets during 2013 leading to a decline in OTTI.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification       Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.        We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.            70       Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios       Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both of the AFS and trading portfolios.       Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios – Trading Securities” in our 2012 Form 10-K for further details.       AFS Securities       In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the        72       amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.        The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                 Rating Agency        As of June 30, 2013        As of December 31, 2012      NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of      Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total                                                                                     Investment Grade Securities                                                                      1        Aaa / Aa / A        $  42,166 				       $  45,736 				     56.5% 				       $  41,477 				       $  47,913 				     57.9% 				     2        Baa          29,956 				         31,325 				     38.7% 				         27,914 				         30,995 				     37.5% 				     Total investment grade securities          72,122 				         77,061 				     95.2% 				         69,391 				         78,908 				     95.4% 				                                                                                    Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                      3        Ba          2,559 				         2,549 				     3.2% 				         2,425 				         2,468 				     2.9% 				     4        B          1,078 				         999 				     1.2% 				         1,171 				         1,070 				     1.3% 				     5        Caa and lower          302 				         255 				     0.3% 				         331 				         246 				     0.3% 				     6        In or near default          88 				         69 				     0.1% 				         77 				         52 				     0.1% 				     Total below investment grade securities          4,027 				         3,872 				     4.8% 				         4,004 				         3,836 				     4.6% 				     Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  76,149 				       $  80,933 				     100.0% 				       $  73,395 				       $  82,744 				     100.0% 				                                                                                    Total securities below investment                                                                      grade as a percentage of total                                                                      fixed maturity AFS securities          5.3% 				         4.8% 				                 5.5% 				         4.6% 				                  (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the NAIC or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.       Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).        We have identified select countries in Europe that are currently experiencing stress in the credit markets, notably Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Cyprus and Slovenia. These countries were identified due to high credit spreads and political and economic uncertainty. Our exposure was determined by country of risk, defined as the country where the issuer primarily conducts business, unless another company is deemed to have control. Our investments by country as of June 30, 2013, are presented below (in millions):                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Amortized Cost        Fair Value           Sovereign        Financial        Other        Total        Sovereign        Financial        Other        Total      Spain    $     -        $     -        $  294 				       $  294 				       $     -        $     -        $  319 				       $  319 				     Ireland         -          7 				         209 				         216 				            -          11 				         207 				         218 				     Italy      3 				            -          140 				         143 				         3 				            -          153 				         156 				     Portugal         -             -          40 				         40 				            -             -          39 				         39 				     Total    $  3 				       $  7 				       $  683 				       $  693 				       $  3 				       $  11 				       $  718 				       $  732 				        We have no exposure to any issuers in Greece, Hungary, Cyprus or Slovenia.        We manage European and other investment risks through our internal investment department and outside asset managers. The risk management is focused on monitoring spreads, pricing and monitoring of global economic developments.        As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, 89.2% and 68.7%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 4 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on AFS      73       securities as of June 30, 2013, increased $680 million. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2013, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell these debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.       Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) as of June 30, 2013, was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 Gross         Estimated        Estimated                                               Unrealized        Years        Average                                               Losses        Until Call        Years                                   Fair        and        or         Until        Subordination Level               Value        OTTI        Maturity        Recovery        Current        Origination      CMBS    $  197 				       $  20 				       1 to 40        20        13.3%            8.7%          Hybrid and redeemable                                                                   preferred securities      325 				         73 				       1 to 53        26        N/A            N/A             As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2012 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.        The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.       We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:         ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.      To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:         ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.       As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $98.7 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $85.7 billion as of June 30, 2013. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $63.0 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $698 million, as of June 30, 2013, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at      74       any point of time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.        See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K and Note 4 for additional discussion.       As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $12.5 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, representing 13% of total invested assets.       For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 3 in this report and Note 4 in our 2012 Form 10-K.        Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)       See “Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion of our MBS.        Our RMBS had a market value of $5.3 billion and an unrealized gain of $272 million, or 5%, as of June 30, 2013.            75          The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $462 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of June 30, 2013. AFS securities represented $448 million, or 97%, and trading securities represented $14 million, or 3%, of the subprime exposure as of June 30, 2013. The table below summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of residential mortgages (in millions) as of June 30, 2013:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prime Agency        Prime/ Non-Agency        Alt-A        Subprime        Total                                                              Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized           Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost          Type                                                                                                                              RMBS    $  3,996 				       $  3,726 				       $  660 				       $  652 				       $  420 				       $  436 				       $  2 				       $  2 				       $  5,078 				       $  4,816 				         ABS home equity      3 				         3 				            -

(3)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.

(2)    Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $12 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $12 million in trading securities consisted of $9 million CMBS and $3 million CRE CDOs.     (3)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.       As of June 30, 2013, the amortized cost and fair value of our AFS exposure to Monoline insurers was $583 million and $597 million, respectively.        Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities       When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.            77       The composition by industry categories of all securities in unrealized loss status (in millions) as of June 30, 2013, was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                 %                                                   Gross        Gross                       %                    %        Unrealized        Unrealized           Fair        Fair        Amortized        Amortized        Losses        Losses           Value        Value        Cost        Cost        and OTTI        and OTTI      Banking    $  883 				     5.0% 				       $  1,013 				     5.4% 				       $  130 				     10.8% 				     Electric      1,802 				     10.3% 				         1,912 				     10.2% 				         110 				     9.2% 				     ABS      641 				     3.7% 				         745 				     4.0% 				         104 				     8.7% 				     Metals and mining      973 				     5.6% 				         1,054 				     5.6% 				         81 				     6.8% 				     Technology      1,069 				     6.1% 				         1,124 				     6.0% 				         55 				     4.6% 				     Independent      822 				     4.7% 				         873 				     4.7% 				         51 				     4.3% 				     CMO      698 				     4.0% 				         748 				     4.0% 				         50 				     4.2% 				     Food and beverage      852 				     4.9% 				         895 				     4.8% 				         43 				     3.6% 				     Chemicals      770 				     4.4% 				         808 				     4.3% 				         38 				     3.2% 				     Pipelines      487 				     2.8% 				         520 				     2.8% 				         33 				     2.8% 				     Retailers      318 				     1.8% 				         351 				     1.9% 				         33 				     2.8% 				     Diversified manufacturing      464 				     2.7% 				         494 				     2.6% 				         30 				     2.5% 				     Oil field services      541 				     3.1% 				         570 				     3.1% 				         29 				     2.4% 				     Media - non-cable      455 				     2.6% 				         482 				     2.6% 				         27 				     2.3% 				     Healthcare      546 				     3.1% 				         572 				     3.1% 				         26 				     2.2% 				     Property and casualty      190 				     1.1% 				         213 				     1.1% 				         23 				     1.9% 				     Integrated      337 				     1.9% 				         359 				     1.9% 				         22 				     1.8% 				     Consumer cyclical services      325 				     1.9% 				         346 				     1.9% 				         21 				     1.8% 				     CMBS      219 				     1.3% 				         239 				     1.3% 				         20 				     1.7% 				     Local authorities      305 				     1.7% 				         325 				     1.7% 				         20 				     1.7% 				     Entertainment      301 				     1.7% 				         320 				     1.7% 				         19 				     1.6% 				     Owned no guarantee      233 				     1.3% 				         252 				     1.3% 				         19 				     1.6% 				     Media - cable      299 				     1.7% 				         317 				     1.7% 				         18 				     1.5% 				     Health insurance      205 				     1.2% 				         221 				     1.2% 				         16 				     1.3% 				     Pharmaceuticals      292 				     1.7% 				         307 				     1.6% 				         15 				     1.3% 				     Paper      173 				     1.0% 				         187 				     1.0% 				         14 				     1.2% 				     Distributors      333 				     1.9% 				         346 				     1.9% 				         13 				     1.1% 				     Consumer products      185 				     1.1% 				         197 				     1.1% 				         12 				     1.0% 				     Aerospace/defense      147 				     0.8% 				         158 				     0.8% 				         11 				     0.9% 				     Industries with unrealized losses                                                               less than $10 million      2,622 				     14.9% 				         2,734 				     14.7% 				         112 				     9.2% 				     Total by industry    $  17,487 				     100.0% 				       $  18,682 				     100.0% 				       $  1,195 				     100.0% 				                                                                    Total by industry as a percentage                                                              of total AFS securities      21.6% 				                 24.5% 				                 100.0% 				                As of June 30, 2013, the amortized cost and fair value of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status was $509 million and $381 million, respectively.

and disruption that began in the second half of 2007 and continued and substantially increased throughout 2008 that led to a decrease in the overall liquidity and availability of capital in the mortgage loan market, and in particular a decrease in activity by securitization lenders. These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.        79       See Note 4 for information regarding our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios and our allowance for loan losses.       As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, there were 5 and 10 impaired mortgage loans on real estate, respectively, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of June 30, 2013, was $11 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of June 30, 2013, was $1 million. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2012, was $20 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2012, was $7 million. See Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans on real estate.       Alternative Investments       Investment income (loss) on alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Annuities    $  6 				       $  13 				       -54%        $  8 				       $  19 				       -58%      Retirement Plan Services      3 				         7 				       -57%          4 				         10 				       -60%      Life Insurance      21 				         25 				       -16%          22 				         46 				       -52%      Group Protection      2 				         4 				       -50%          3 				         5 				       -40%      Other Operations         -          1 				       -100%             -          1 				       -100%      Total (1)    $  32 				       $  50 				       -36%        $  37 				       $  81 				       -54%           (1)    Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.      As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, alternative investments included investments in 102 and 98 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.       As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” in our 2012 Form 10-K, we update the carrying value of our alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the investees for the preceding year become available. Net investment income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by segment (in millions) related to the effect of preceding year audit adjustments recorded during the indicated year at the investee was as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Annuities    $  1 				       $  1 				     0% 				       $  2 				       $  5 				       -60%      Retirement Plan Services         -             -        NM          1 				         2 				       -50%      Life Insurance      4 				         10 				       -60%          6 				         23 				       -74%      Group Protection         -             -        NM             -          2 				       -100%      Total    $  5 				       $  11 				       -55%        $  9 				       $  32 				       -72%         Non-Income Producing Investments       As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $15 million and $14 million, respectively.            80          Net Investment Income       Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Fixed maturity AFS securities    $  991 				       $  980 				     1% 				       $  1,978 				       $  1,949 				     1% 				     Equity AFS securities      1 				         1 				     0% 				         3 				         3 				     0% 				     Trading securities      35 				         37 				       -5%          70 				         75 				       -7%      Mortgage loans on real estate      97 				         100 				       -3%          195 				         201 				       -3%      Real estate      4 				         4 				     0% 				         7 				         8 				       -13%      Policy loans      39 				         42 				       -7%          77 				         87 				       -11%      Invested cash      1 				         1 				     0% 				         2 				         2 				     0% 				     Commercial mortgage loan                                                                  prepayment and bond                                                                   make-whole premiums (1)      45 				         12 				     275% 				         58 				         18 				     222% 				     Alternative investments (2)      32 				         50 				       -36%          37 				         81 				       -54%      Consent fees         -          1 				       -100%          1 				         1 				     0% 				     Other investments      (1) 				         (6) 				     83% 				         (4) 				         (11) 				     64% 				     Investment income      1,244 				         1,222 				     2% 				         2,424 				         2,414 				     0% 				     Investment expense      (31) 				         (25) 				       -24%          (61) 				         (52) 				       -17%      Net investment income    $  1,213 				       $  1,197 				     1% 				       $  2,363 				       $  2,362 				     0% 				          (1)    See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.           81          Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums       Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.       The increase in prepayment and make-whole premiums when comparing 2013 to 2012 was attributable primarily to increased refinancing activity.

When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest rate-related impairments.       Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2013 and 2012, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.        We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.       When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2012 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.           82       Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      OTTI Recognized in Net Income (Loss)                                                                  Corporate bonds    $  (7) 				       $  (10) 				     30% 				       $  (10) 				       $  (29) 				     66% 				     RMBS      (5) 				         (14) 				     64% 				         (16) 				         (32) 				     50% 				     CMBS      (12) 				         (16) 				     25% 				         (14) 				         (36) 				     61% 				     CDOs         -             -        NM          (1) 				            -        NM      Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)                                                                   income (loss)      (24) 				         (40) 				     40% 				         (41) 				         (97) 				     58% 				     Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                                                  DSI and DFEL      5 				         7 				       -29%          8 				         17 				       -53%      Net OTTI recognized in net                                                                  income (loss), pre-tax    $  (19) 				       $  (33) 				     42% 				       $  (33) 				       $  (80) 				     59% 				                                                                        Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                                                                   Gross OTTI recognized in OCI    $  1 				       $  21 				       -95%        $  7 				       $  79 				       -91%      Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL         -          (4) 				     100% 				         (1) 				         (12) 				     92% 				     Net portion of OTTI recognized in                                                                   OCI, pre-tax    $  1 				       $  17 				       -94%        $  6 				       $  67 				       -91%         The decrease in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first six months of 2013 to the same period in 2012 was attributable to declines in write-downs for OTTI on corporate bonds and structured holdings. The improvements of the write-downs for OTTI on our RMBS and CMBS holdings were primarily attributable to gradual recovery in both residential and commercial real estate markets. The write-downs of our structured holdings were due primarily to idiosyncratic risk that affected individual securities rather than overall market weakness.       The $48 million of impairments taken during the first six months of 2013 were split between $41 million of credit-related impairments and $7 million of noncredit-related impairments. The credit-related impairments were largely attributable to our RMBS and CMBS holdings primarily as a result of continued weakness within the residential and commercial real estate market that affected select holdings. The noncredit-related impairments were due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.       REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow       Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $55 million and $614 million for the first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.        The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or increase). During the first six months of 2013, our payables for collateral on derivative investments decreased by $1.1 billion as rising interest rates and equity markets and less volatility lowered the fair values of the associated derivative investments.

Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.

We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.            84          Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                     For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013                                       Maturities,        Change                                                                       Repayments        in Fair                                           Beginning                         and         Value            Other            Ending           Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt (2)    $  200 				       $     -            $  (200) 				           $     -            $  506 				           $  506 				                                                                                                Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,978 				       $     -            $     -            $  (129) 				           $  (510) 				           $  3,339 				     Bank borrowing (3)         -             -              250 				                -                 -              250 				     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                                                                          Indianapolis advance      250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Capital securities      1,211 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,211 				     Total long-term debt    $  5,439 				       $     -            $  250 				           $  (129) 				           $  (510) 				           $  5,050 				          (1)    Includes non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.    (2)    As of June 30, 2013, consisted of a $300 million 4.75% fixed rate senior note maturing on January 30, 2014, and a $200 million 4.75% fixed rate senior note maturing on February 15, 2014. We expect to pre-fund up to $350 million of the maturing debt prior to the end of 2013.    (3)    On June 6, 2013, we refinanced a $200 million floating rate loan that was scheduled to mature on July 18, 2013, into a $250 million floating rate loan maturing on June 6, 2018.       The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet the maturities mentioned above will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of June 30, 2013, the holding company had available liquidity of $693 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held as collateral, investments maturing in one year or less at origination and receivables under the inter-company cash management program, less payables under the inter-company cash management program, payables from purchases of securities not settled as of the balance sheet date and commercial paper outstanding.        Effective as of May 29, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. This agreement (the “credit facility”) allows for the issuance of LOCs of up to $2.5 billion and borrowing of up to $2.5 billion, $1.75 billion of which is available only to reimburse the banks for drawn LOCs. The credit facility is unsecured and has a commitment termination date of May 29, 2018. The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated reinsurance companies, as discussed above in “Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain,” and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.       The credit facility contains or includes:         ·    Customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;    ·    Financial covenants including maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth (as defined in the facility) equal to the sum of $9.4 billion plus fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate net proceeds of equity issuances received by us in accordance with the terms of the credit facility; and a debt-to-capital ratio as defined in accordance with the credit facility not to exceed 0.35 to 1.00; and     ·    Customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods for certain of those events of default.      Upon an event of default, the credit facility provides that, among other things, the commitments may be terminated and the loans then outstanding may be declared due and payable. As of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with all such covenants.       This credit facility replaced our previous four-year credit facility dated as of June 10, 2011, that was scheduled to expire on June 10, 2015.        For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2012 Form 10-K.       We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales and do not have any other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1      85       (S&P/Moody’s) as of June 30, 2013. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products.  During the second quarter of 2013, Moody’s upgraded the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries from A2 to A1. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2012 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2012 Form 10-K for additional information on our financial strength ratings.       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2012 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.       Alternative Sources of Liquidity       In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. The holding company had an outstanding payable of $54 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from amounts placed by the subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account in excess of funds borrowed by those subsidiaries as of June 30, 2013. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and cash equivalents. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.       Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2013, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $2.8 billion out on loan or subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.       Divestitures       For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2012 Form 10-K.       Uses of Capital       Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.        Return of Capital to Common Stockholders        One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.           86          Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Common dividends to stockholders    $  32 				       $  23 				     39% 				       $  65 				       $  46 				     41% 				     Repurchase of common stock      150 				         150 				     0% 				         250 				         300 				       -17%      Total cash returned to stockholders    $  182 				       $  173 				     5% 				       $  315 				       $  346 				       -9%                                                                         Number of shares repurchased      4.324 				         6.474 				       -33%          7.696 				         12.492 				       -38%      Average price per share    $  34.71 				       $  23.19 				     50% 				       $  32.50 				       $  24.04 				     35% 				        On November 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.08 to $0.12 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during the remainder of 2013 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.       Other Uses of Capital       In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                     For the Three                For the Six                   Months Ended                Months Ended                   June 30,                June 30,                   2013        2012        Change        2013        2012        Change      Debt service (interest paid)    $  77 				       $  77 				     0% 				       $  137 				       $  140 				       -2%         The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.       Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow       As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.        OTHER MATTERS       Other Factors Affecting Our Business       In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to      87       several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit related derivatives risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).       Interest Rate Risk         Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses        In periods of low interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.        Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.       If we were to assume a hypothetical stress scenario where the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate remains at 250 basis points through the end of 2014, the impact relative to 2013 would result in an approximate unfavorable earnings effect of $35 million in 2014. The earnings drag from this scenario related to the effect of continued low new money rates is largely concentrated in our Life Insurance and Retirement Plan Services segments.       The estimates above are based upon hypothetical scenarios and are only representative of the effects of assumptions around rates through 2014 keeping all else equal and does not give consideration to the aggregate effect of other factors, including but not limited to: contract holder activity; sales; hedge positions; changing equity markets; shifts in implied volatilities; and changes in other capital market sectors as well as actions we might take to mitigate the effect of the low rate environment. In addition, the scenarios only illustrated the effect to spreads and certain unlocking and reserve changes. Other potential effects of the scenarios were not considered in the analysis. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K for additional information on interest rates.            88          The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the June 30, 2013, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the second quarter of 2013 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:                                                                                                                                                                 Account Values                       Retirement                                %                            Plan            Life                         Account           Annuities            Services        Insurance (1)        Total        Values      Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                                      Discretionary rate setting products: (2)                                                                      Occurring within the next twelve months: (3)                                                                      No difference    $  8,703 				           $  9,991 				           $  30,448 				           $  49,142 				     71.9% 				     Up to 0.50%      2,482 				             451 				             377 				             3,310 				     4.8% 				     0.51% to 1.00%      679 				             137 				             128 				             944 				     1.4% 				     1.01% to 1.50%      431 				             15 				                -              446 				     0.7% 				     1.51% to 2.00%      342 				                -              282 				             624 				     0.9% 				     2.01% to 2.50%      111 				                -                 -              111 				     0.2% 				     2.51% to 3.00%      159 				                -                 -              159 				     0.2% 				     Occurring after the next twelve months (4)      6,779 				                -                 -              6,779 				     9.9% 				     Total discretionary rate setting products       19,686 				             10,594 				             31,235 				             61,515 				     90.0% 				     Other contracts (5)      2,439 				             4,441 				                -              6,880 				     10.0% 				     Total account values    $  22,125 				           $  15,035 				           $  31,235 				           $  68,395 				     100.0% 				                                                                            Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                                      values at minimum guaranteed rates      44.2% 				             94.3% 				             97.5% 				             79.9% 				                  (1)    Excludes policy loans.    (2)    Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.    (3)    The average crediting rates were 26 basis points, 3 basis points and 3 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.    (4)    The average crediting rates were 151 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Of our account values for these products, 11% are scheduled to reset in more than one year but not more than two years; 22% are scheduled to reset in more than two years but not more than three years; and 67% are scheduled to reset in more than three years.     (5)    For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to immediate annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 2 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates, and 97% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.      The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.       Derivatives       See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.       Equity Market Risk       Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2012 Form 10-K for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.           89          Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity       If the level of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 1% immediately after June 30, 2013, we estimate the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions) for the next 12 month period from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses would be approximately $7 million. For purposes of this sensitivity, we used the S&P 500 as a proxy for equity market performance. This estimate excludes any effect related to sales, unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change.        The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases or decreases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative and is concentrated primarily in our Annuities and Retirement Plan Services segments. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.        Credit-Related Derivatives       We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 5 for additional information.        Credit Risk         See Note 5 for information on our credit risk.       In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:                                                                                                         As of        As of               June 30,    December 31,                   2013            2012              AA        $  3 				           $  1 				             A          102 				             14 				             Total         $  105 				           $  15 				                Item 4. Controls and Procedures       Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.       Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2013, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.            90       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1.
