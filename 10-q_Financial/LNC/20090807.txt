Item 1A. Risk Factors,” as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Income (loss) from operations is net income recorded in accordance with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) excluding the after-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·  Realized gains and losses associated with the following (“excluded realized loss”):        §  Sale or disposal of securities;        §  Impairments of securities;        §  Change in the fair value of embedded derivatives within certain reinsurance arrangements and the change in the fair value of related trading securities;        §  Change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives of our guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) within our variable annuities net of the change in the fair value of the derivatives we own to hedge the changes in the embedded derivative (“GLB net derivative results”);        §  Net difference between the benefit ratio unlocking of Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”) reserves on our guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”) riders within our variable annuities and the change in the fair value of the derivatives excluding our expected cost of purchasing the hedging instruments (“GDB derivatives results”); and        §  Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products as required under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) and SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) (“Indexed annuity forward-starting option”).     ·  Income (loss) from the initial adoption of changes in accounting principles;     ·  Income (loss) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance;     ·  Gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, including subordinated debt;     ·  Losses from the impairment of intangible assets; and     ·  Income (loss) from discontinued operations.   Operating revenues represent GAAP revenues excluding the pre-tax effects of the following items, as applicable:       ·  Excluded realized loss;     ·  Amortization of deferred gains arising from the reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance; and     ·  Revenue adjustments from the initial impact of the adoption of changes in accounting principles.   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 17. Our management and Board of Directors believe that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations do not replace revenues and net income as the GAAP measures of our consolidated results of operations.         57       Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2008, we changed our definitions of segment operating revenues and income from operations to better reflect: the underlying economics of our variable and indexed annuities that employ derivative instruments to hedge policy benefits; and the manner in which management evaluates that business. Our change in the definition of income from operations is primarily the result of our adoption of SFAS 157 during the first quarter of 2008. Under the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS 157, we are required to measure the fair value of these annuities from an “exit price” perspective, (i.e., the exchange price between market participants to transfer the liability). We, therefore, must include margins that a market participant buyer would require as well as a factor for non-performance risk (“NPR”) related to our credit quality. We do not believe that these factors relate to the economics of the underlying business and do not reflect the manner in which management evaluates the business. The items that are now excluded from our operating results that were previously included are as follows: GLB net derivatives results; indexed annuity forward-starting option; and GDB derivatives results. For more information regarding this change, see our current report on Form 8-K dated July 16, 2008.   We continue to exclude the effects of any realized gain (loss) on investments from segment operating revenues and income from operations as we believe that such items are not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments.   We believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business. See “Realized Loss” below for more information about these items.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information. Included in these reclassifications is the change in our definition of segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations as discussed above. To that end, we have reclassified the results of certain derivatives and embedded derivatives to realized loss, which were previously reported within insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited or benefits. The associated amortization expense of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired (“VOBA”) (previously reported within underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) (previously reported within interest credited), deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) (previously reported within insurance fees) and changes in contract holder funds (previously reported within benefits) have also been reclassified to realized loss. See “Basis of Presentation” in Note 1 for details.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by LNC or on LNC’s behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. LNC claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:       ·  Continued deterioration in general economic and business conditions, both domestic and foreign, that may affect foreign exchange rates, premium levels, claims experience, the level of pension benefit costs and funding and investment results;     ·  Continued economic declines and credit market illiquidity could cause us to realize additional impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·  Uncertainty about the impact of the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) on the economy;     ·  The cost and other consequences of the existing regulation to which we are subject and potential regulations to which we could become subject as a result of our participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”);

restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. Federal tax reform;       58             ·  The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against LNC or its subsidiaries, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which LNC and its subsidiaries compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and extra-contractual and class action damage cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;     ·  Changes in interest rates causing a reduction of investment income, the margins of LNC’s fixed annuity and life insurance businesses and demand for LNC’s products;     ·  A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of LNC’s products, a reduction of asset-based fees that LNC charges on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of LNC’s variable annuity products;     ·  Ineffectiveness of LNC’s various hedging strategies used to offset the impact of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;     ·  A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from LNC’s assumptions used in pricing its products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the amortization of intangibles that may result in an increase in reserves and a decrease in net income, including as a result of stranger-originated life insurance business;     ·  Changes in GAAP that may result in unanticipated changes to LNC’s net income;     ·  Lowering of one or more of LNC’s debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse impact such action may have on LNC’s ability to raise capital and on its liquidity and financial condition;     ·  Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of LNC’s insurance subsidiaries and the adverse impact such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of its insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;     ·  Significant credit, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in the portfolios of LNC’s companies requiring that LNC realize losses on such investments;     ·  The impact of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items, including LNC’s ability to integrate acquisitions and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from acquisitions;     ·  The adequacy and collectibility of reinsurance that LNC has purchased;     ·  Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect LNC’s businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;     ·  Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that LNC can charge for its products;     ·  The unknown impact on LNC’s business resulting from changes in the demographics of LNC’s client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and     ·  Loss of key management, portfolio managers in the Investment Management segment, financial planners or wholesalers.   The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, our 2008 Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could impact LNC’s business and financial performance, including “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the risk discussions included in this section under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” “Consolidated Investments” and “Reinsurance,” which are incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, LNC operates in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on LNC’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, LNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.   INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, term life insurance, mutual funds and managed accounts.         59       On July 21, 2008, we announced the realignment of our segments under our former Employer Markets and Individual Markets businesses into two new businesses – Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions. We believe the new structure more closely aligns with consumer needs and should lead to more coordinated product development and greater effectiveness across the enterprise. The only change to our segment reporting is reporting the results of the Executive Benefits business, which as of June 30, 2008, was part of the Retirement Products segment, in the Life Insurance segment. Accordingly, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, we provide products and services in four operating business and report results through six segments as follows:         Business    Corresponding Segments  Retirement Solutions    Annuities      Defined Contribution (formerly Retirement Products)        Insurance Solutions    Life Insurance (including Executive Benefits business)      Group Protection        Investment Management    Investment Management        Lincoln UK (1)    Lincoln UK (1)         (1)  On June 15, 2009, we announced that we entered into a share purchase agreement to sell Lincoln UK. The transaction is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2009, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Accordingly, we have reported the results of this business as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and the assets and liabilities as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. See Note 3.   These changes to the Retirement Products and the Life Insurance segments are in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” and reflect the manner in which we are organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Our segment results are reported under this new structure beginning in the third quarter of 2008, and we have restated results from prior periods in a consistent manner. We view the changes to the existing segments as immaterial. These operating businesses and their segments are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2008 Form 10-K.   We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. Other Operations also includes our run-off Institutional Pension business, the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of this business previously sold to Swiss Re and the results of our remaining media businesses.    Current Market Conditions   During the second quarter of 2009, the capital and credit markets showed signs of improvement following a period of extreme volatility and disruption for more than 12 months that affected both equity market returns and interest rates. During this period, credit spreads widened across asset classes and reduced liquidity in the credit markets. The price of our common stock steadily increased during the second quarter of 2009 to close at $17.21 on June 30, 2009, as compared to $18.84 on December 31, 2008, and traded at a low of $4.90 during the first six months of 2009. Analysts and economists noted in January 2009 that the U.S. economy lost more jobs in 2008 than in any year subsequent to World War II and projected that the economic recovery might take longer than previously expected. We also experienced a series of ratings downgrades primarily from February 2009 to May 2009 as depressed capital markets continued to strain our liquidity as we prepared to fund debt maturities in the second quarter of 2009; however, recently all four of the major independent rating agencies affirmed our financial strength ratings, and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) improved its outlook on our company to stable from negative following the announcement about our planned capital actions discussed below.  Our ratings are discussed further below.         60       Earnings in 2009 will continue to be unfavorably impacted by the prior significant decline in the equity markets. Due to these challenges, the capital markets had a significant effect on our segment income (loss) from operations and consolidated net income during the first six months of 2009. In the face of these capital market challenges, we continue to focus on building our businesses through these difficult markets and beyond by developing and introducing high quality products, expanding distribution in new and existing key accounts and channels and targeting market segments that have high growth potential while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing our expenses. During the second quarter of 2009, we experienced positive net flows across all of our businesses, more than double the amount of net flows experienced in the year ago quarter. The markets impacted primarily the following areas:   Adequacy of Our Liquidity and Capital Positions   We are committed to managing our capital effectively. The continued adequacy of our liquidity resources to meet requirements of our businesses and our holding company depends upon such factors as market conditions and our ability to access sources of liquidity. In addition, market volatility impacts the level of capital required to support our businesses.   Given this dynamic and challenging environment, we have taken measures to prudently and actively manage our liquidity and capital positions. As discussed in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities,” we issued $690 million of common stock and $500 million of senior notes during the second quarter of 2009 and issued preferred stock and a common stock warrant through the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP in July of 2009, as discussed below in “TARP CPP.” Additionally, we announced on June 15, 2009, the sale of Lincoln UK (see Note 3). These actions compliment our past actions of reducing the dividend on our common stock, suspending stock repurchase activity, restructuring the company to reduce overall expenses and entering into a reinsurance transaction to increase statutory capital for our primary insurance subsidiary.   Currently, we expect to meet the ongoing cash needs of the holding company for the foreseeable future as a result of the raising of $2.1 billion as part of several capital transactions and in combination with expense savings and asset sales described above. See “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report for more information.   For more information on our liquidity and capital positions, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” below.   Ratings   The Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of LNC. Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities.   Rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims, factors more relevant to contract holders than investors. We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our operations. There may be other rating agencies that also rate our securities, which we do not disclose in our reports.   The following summarizes the ratings for LNC and our principal insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing:                  A.M. Best    Fitch    Moody's    S&P  Insurer Financial Strength Ratings                    The Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. ("LNL")    A+    A+    A2    AA-            (2nd of 16)    (5th of 21)    (6th of 21)    (4th of 21)                          Lincoln Life & Annuity Co. of New York ("LLANY")  A+    A+    A2    AA-            (2nd of 16)    (5th of 21)    (6th of 21)    (4th of 21)                          First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Co.

All ratings are on outlook negative, with the exception of S&P, which is stable, as noted above.   All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or LNC can maintain these ratings. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.   Earnings from Assets Under Management   Our asset-gathering segments – Retirement Solutions – Annuities, Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution and Investment Management – are the most sensitive to the equity markets. We discuss the earnings impact of the equity markets on account values, assets under management and the related asset-based earnings below in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity.” From December 31, 2008, to June 30, 2009 our assets under management were up $8.7 billion even though the daily average value of the S&P 500 Index® (“S&P 500”) decreased 6%. However, our assets under management were down $30.7 billion from June 30, 2008, as a result of the equity markets. Strong deposits during the first six months of 2009 have only helped to partially offset this impact, compared to the same period in 2008. The effect of the negative equity markets on our assets under management that we experienced over the last twelve months will continue to dampen our earnings throughout 2009 even if the equity market returns become consistent with our long-term assumptions. Accordingly, we may continue to report lower asset-based fees, higher DAC and VOBA amortization and higher reserves related to our GDB guarantees relative to expectations or prior periods.   Investment Income on Alternative Investments   We believe that overall market conditions in both the equity and credit markets caused our alternative investments portfolio, which consists mostly of hedge funds and various limited partnership investments, to under-perform relative to our long-term return expectations, and we expect these assets to continue to under-perform at least in the short term. During the second quarter of 2009, most of the unfavorable impact from these investments was related to audit adjustments from the completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of our investees. These investments impact primarily our Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment and to a lesser extent our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments. See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” for additional information on our investment portfolio and further discussion on the nature of the audit adjustments referred to above.   Variable Annuity Hedge Program Results   We offer variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees. As described below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits,” we use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for living benefits in certain of our variable annuity products. The change in fair value of these instruments tends to move in the opposite direction of the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. For the first six months of 2009, impacts of changes in interest rate risk favorably affected the net change in the fair value of the living benefit embedded derivative, excluding the effect of our NPR factors, and the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives. The NPR factors used in the calculation of the embedded derivative liability are impacted by the change in the spreads of our credit default swaps (“CDS”) and the associated volume related to volatilities and interest rates adjusted for factors such as liquidity and the priority of our claims-paying rating and had an unfavorable effect on the overall result during the first six months of 2009. These results are excluded from operating revenues and income from operations. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” for information on our methodology for calculating the NPR factors.   We also offer variable products with death benefit guarantees. As described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits” in our 2008 Form 10-K, we use derivative instruments to attempt to hedge in the opposite direction of the impact to our associated reserves for movements in equity markets. These results are excluded from income (loss) from operations.   Variable Annuity Business Model   In order to address the realities of the current market conditions in the variable annuity marketplace, in late January 2009, we introduced changes to our GLB riders including increased rider fees, reduced roll-up periods and tighter investment restrictions on new business and a large percentage of in-force account value. Increased equity market implied volatility and falling interest rates have increased the cost of providing GLBs. The January product changes reduce our exposure to equity market volatility and interest rate movements while compensating us for increasing costs to provide the benefits.       62       Credit Losses, Impairments and Unrealized Losses   Related to our investments in fixed income and equity securities, we experienced net realized losses which reduced net income by $71 million and $159 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, and included credit related write-downs of securities for other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) of $77 million and $155 million, respectively. Although credit spreads remained wider as of June 30, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008, credit spreads have decreased, which resulted in a $2.2 billion decrease in gross unrealized losses on the available-for-sale (“AFS”) fixed maturity securities in our general account as of June 30, 2009. Our unrealized losses are concentrated in the investment grade category of investments and demonstrate how reduced liquidity in the credit markets has impacted asset values. In addition, continued weakness in the economic environment could lead to increased credit defaults, resulting in additional write-downs of securities for OTTI.   Stimulus Legislation   In reaction to the recession, credit market illiquidity and global financial crisis experienced during the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) on October 3, 2008, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, in an effort to restore liquidity to the U.S. credit markets and stimulate the U.S. economy. The EESA defines financial institutions to include insurance companies and contains the TARP. The ARRA and TARP authorized the purchase of “troubled assets” from financial institutions, including insurance companies. Pursuant to the authority granted under the TARP, the U.S. Treasury also adopted the CPP, the Generally Available Capital Access Program and the Exceptional Financial Recovery Assistance Program. Under the CPP, as currently adopted, bank and thrift holding companies may apply to the U.S. Treasury for the direct sale of preferred stock and warrants to the U.S. Treasury. It remains unclear at this point, if and when the EESA and ARRA will restore sustained liquidity and confidence in the markets and its affect on the fair value of our invested assets.    TARP CPP   On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved our application to become a savings and loan holding company and our acquisition of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, a federally regulated savings bank, located in Indiana. We contributed $10 million to the capital of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, and closed on the purchase on January 15, 2009. On November 13, 2008, we filed an application to participate in the CPP that was established under the EESA. On May 8, 2009, the U.S. Treasury granted us preliminary approval to participate in the CPP. On July 10, 2009, we issued, in a private placement, $950 million of Series B preferred stock and a warrant for 13,049,451 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $10.92 per share to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Financing Activities” for more information about our preferred stock issuance.   Participation in the CPP subjects us to increased oversight by the U.S. Treasury. The U.S. Treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable statutes and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulators. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has the right to appoint two directors to our Board if we miss dividend payments for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, on the preferred stock. Participation in the CPP may also subject us to increased Congressional scrutiny.   In connection with participating in the CPP, we registered as a savings and loan holding company, which subjects us to new legal and regulatory requirements, including minimum capital requirements, and subjects us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve.   We are also subject to certain restrictions, notably, limits on incentive compensation for certain executives and employees for the duration of the U.S. Treasury’s investment. We are also subject to limits on increasing the dividend on our common stock and redeeming capital stock (unless the U.S. Treasury consents), both of which apply until the third anniversary of the U.S. Treasury’s investment unless we redeem the Series B preferred shares in whole or the U.S. Treasury transfers all of the Series B preferred stock to third parties.   The U.S. Treasury will not vote the Series B preferred stock or the common stock it may receive upon exercise of the warrant. However, with respect to the Series B preferred stock, the U.S. Treasury would have class voting rights on the issuance of shares ranking senior to the Series B preferred stock, amendments to the rights of the Series B preferred stock or any merger, exchange or similar transaction that would adversely affect the rights of the Series B preferred stock. If dividends on the Series B preferred stock are not paid in full for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the Series B preferred stock will have the right, together with the holders of any other affected classes of future parity stock, voting as a single class, to elect two directors.         63       Under current CPP documentation, if we receive aggregate cash proceeds equal to not less than 100% of the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series B preferred stock sold to the U.S. Treasury from the sale of shares of common stock, perpetual preferred stock or any combination of such securities after the closing of our CPP transaction and on or prior to December 31, 2009, the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant held by the U.S. Treasury will be reduced by half. In addition, under current guidance, after redeeming the Series B preferred stock, we will have the right to repurchase the warrant for its appraised market value, and if we do not repurchase the warrant, the U.S. Treasury can liquidate the warrant. In addition, we have granted the U.S. Treasury registration rights covering the shares of Series B preferred stock, the warrant and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrant.   Challenges and Outlook   For the remainder 2009, we expect major challenges to include:       ·  Continuation of volatility in the capital markets, resulting in hedge breakage and possible additional erosion in variable account values;     ·  Continuation of illiquid credit markets and impact on spreads and on other-than-temporary securities impairments;     ·  Continuation of the low interest rate environment, which creates a challenge for our products that generate investment margin profits, such as fixed annuities and UL;     ·  Possible additional intangible asset impairments, such as goodwill, if the financial performance of our reporting units deteriorates, our market capitalization remains below book value for a prolonged period of time or business valuation assumptions (such as discount rates and equity market volatility) deteriorate further;     ·  Continuation of the recession and other challenges in the economy;     ·  Achieving success in our portfolio of products, marketplace acceptance of new variable annuity features and maintaining management and wholesalers that will help maintain our competitive position; and     ·  Continuation of focus by the government on tax reform including potential changes in company dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) calculations, which may impact our products and overall earnings.   In the face of these challenges, we expect to focus on the following throughout the remainder of 2009:       ·  Continue near term product development in our manufacturing units and future product development initiatives, with particular focus on further reducing risk related to guaranteed benefit riders offered with certain variable annuities;     ·  Manage our expenses aggressively and utilize cost reduction initiatives along with continued financial and execution discipline throughout our operations; and     ·  Substantially complete the remaining platform and system consolidations necessary to achieve the final portion of integration cost saves as well as prepare us for more effective customer interaction in the future.   For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.         64      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2008 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the critical accounting policies and estimates provided in our 2008 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   Under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (“SFAS 142”) goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment tests conducted at least annually. Intangibles that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. SFAS 142 requires that we perform a two-step test in our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill. In Step 1 of the evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be sufficient and Step 2 is not required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, it is an indicator that impairment may exist and Step 2 is required to be performed. In Step 2, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value as determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and written down to its fair value. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for goodwill by reporting unit.   We use October 1 as the annual review date for goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing. However, when factors indicate that an impairment could be present, we reassess our conclusions related to goodwill recoverability through completion of an interim test. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in impairment of goodwill during 2009. Due to volatile capital markets and their unfavorable impact to our liquidity, earnings and discount rate assumptions and the execution of a reinsurance transaction on our life business, we completed an interim test of goodwill impairment as of March 31, 2009.   We performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis on all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2009. The Step 1 analysis for Insurance Solutions – Life and Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting units utilized primarily a discounted cash flow valuation technique. In determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units, we incorporated consideration of discounted cash flow calculations, the level of our own share price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing these reporting units. Our fair value estimations were based primarily on an in-depth analysis of projected future cash flows and relevant discount rates, which considered market participant inputs (“income approach”). The discounted cash flow analysis required us to make judgments about revenues, earnings projections, capital market assumptions and discount rates. The key assumptions used in the analysis to determine the fair value of these reporting units included:       ·  New business for 10 years and run off of cash flows on in-force and new business for the life of the reporting unit;     ·  Adjustments of several assumptions in our projections to reflect conservatism in the near-term as a result of the current volatility in the capital markets, including:        §  Lower equity market returns for 2 years;        §  Lower alternative investment income returns for 2 years;        §  Higher line of credit costs related to reserve securitizations;     ·  Discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 16.0%, which were based on the weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. We used 11.0% for our Insurance Solutions – Life reporting unit and 16.0% for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit.   For our other reporting units, we used other available information including market data obtained through strategic reviews and other analysis to support our Step 1 conclusions.   In the first quarter of 2009, all of our reporting units passed the Step 1 analysis, except for our Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit, which required a Step 2 analysis to be completed. In our Step 2 analysis, we estimated the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value determined in Step 1 to all of its net assets (recognized and unrecognized) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test.   Based upon our Step 2 analysis, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $600 million for the Retirement Solutions – Annuities reporting unit in the first quarter of 2009, which was attributable primarily to higher discount rates related to higher debt costs and equity market volatility, deterioration in equity markets and lower annuity sales.        65       There were no indicators of impairment as of June 30, 2009, due primarily to the continued improvement in the equity markets and lower discount rates during the second quarter of 2009.  Investments   Investment Valuation   We use an internationally recognized pricing service as our primary pricing source, and we generally do not obtain multiple prices for our financial instruments. We generally use prices from the pricing service rather than broker quotes as we have documentation from the pricing service on the observable market inputs that they use to determine the prices in contrast to the broker quotes where we have limited information on the pricing inputs.   Our primary third party pricing service has policies and processes to ensure that they are using objectively verifiable observable market data. The pricing service regularly reviews the evaluation inputs for securities covered, including broker quotes, executed trades and credit information, as applicable. If the pricing service determines it does not have sufficient objectively verifiable information about a security’s valuation, they discontinue providing a valuation for the security. The pricing service regularly publishes and updates a summary of inputs used in their valuations by major security type. In addition, we have policies and procedures in place to review the process that is utilized by the third party pricing service and the output that is provided to ensure we are in agreement with the output provided by the pricing service. On a periodic basis, we test the pricing for a sample of securities to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used by the pricing service. In addition, we perform a check on prices provided by our primary pricing service to ensure that they are not stale or unreasonable by reviewing the prices for unusual changes from period to period based on certain parameters or for lack of change from one period to the next. If such anomalies in the pricing are observed, we verify the price provided by our pricing service with another pricing source.   As of June 30, 2009, we only obtained multiple prices for 99 available-for-sale and trading securities. These multiple prices were primarily related to instances where the vendor was providing a price for the first time and we also received a broker quote. In these instances, we used the price from the pricing service due to the higher reliability as discussed above.   For certain available-for-sale and trading securities, such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), we obtain a broker quote when sufficient information, such as security structure or other market information, is not available to produce an evaluation. The brokers are asked to provide prices at which they believe they would trade the security; however, the inputs used by the brokers are unknown. Broker-quoted securities are adjusted based solely on receipt of updated quotes from market makers or broker-dealers recognized as market participants. Generally, the price for a security on this list is based on a quote from a single broker or market maker. As of June 30, 2009, we used broker quotes for 319 securities as our final price source.   For additional information, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Adoption of FSP FAS No. 115-2 and 124-2 – Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary-Impairments   We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS No. 115-2 and 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary-Impairments” (“FSP FAS 115-2”) for our debt securities effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 required that an OTTI loss be separated into the amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected (“credit loss”), which is recognized in earnings, and the amount related to all other factors (“noncredit loss”), which is recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). In addition, FSP FAS 115-2 replaces the requirement for management to assert that it has the intent and ability to hold an impaired security until recovery with the requirement that management assert that it does not have the intent to sell the security and that it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.           66        We regularly review our AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be other-than-temporary. In accordance with FSP FAS 115-2, if we intend to sell a security and the market value of the security is below amortized cost, the amortized cost is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), as this is deemed a credit-related event. If we do not intend to sell a security but believe we will not recover a security’s amortized cost, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), as this is also deemed a credit-related event, and the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to OCI – unrealized OTTI on AFS securities on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, as this is considered a noncredit (i.e., recoverable) event. The determination of our intent to sell a security is based upon whether we can assert that we do not have the intent to sell the security and if it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s cost basis. In making this determination, we evaluate facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our security portfolio, sale of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing. The credit loss on a security is based upon our estimate of the decrease in expected cash flows or our best estimate of credit deterioration.   As a result of the adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment, resulting in an increase of $102 million to our opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding decrease to accumulated OCI, to reclassify the noncredit portion of previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities. In addition, the amortized cost basis of debt securities for which a noncredit OTTI loss was previously recognized was increased by $199 million, or the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment, pre-DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and tax. The fair value of our debt securities did not change as a result of the adoption.    We recognized an OTTI loss of $144 million and $280 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, of which $77 million and $155 million were recognized in net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) related to credit losses and $67 million and $125 million were recognized in OCI on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity related to noncredit losses, respectively. For additional details, see “Investments” below and Notes 2 and 5.   Adoption of FSP FAS No. 157-4 – Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly   We adopted FSP FAS No. 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly” (“FSP FAS 157-4”), effective January 1, 2009. FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability and additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly.   FSP FAS 157-4 does not change the objective of a fair value measurement. That is, even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a security, the fair value objective remains the same. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell the security in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced liquidation or distressed sale), between market participants at the measurement date in the current inactive market (i.e., an “exit price” notion).   FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability. The FSP also provides additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly. Specifically, the FSP provides factors that indicate that a market is not active, including:       ·  Few recent transactions based on volume and level of activity in the market, therefore there is not sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis;     ·  Price quotations are not based on current information;     ·  Price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers;     ·  Indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent fair values;     ·  Abnormal, or significant increases in, liquidity risk premiums or implied yields for quoted prices when compared with reasonable estimates using realistic assumptions of credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset class;     ·  Abnormally wide bid-ask spread or significant increases in the bid-ask spread; and     ·  Little information is released publicly.   After evaluating all factors and considering the significance and relevance of each factor, the reporting entity shall use its judgment in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when the market for that asset is not active. The factors should be considered in relation to the normal market activity for the asset.           67        When the market for an asset or liability has exhibited a significant decrease in transaction volume when compared to normal market activity for the asset or liability (or similar assets and liabilities), additional analysis is required to ascertain whether or not observed transactions or quoted prices are reflective of fair values. When there has been a significant decline in activity and a market is no longer active, the use of multiple valuation techniques (or a change in valuation technique) may be appropriate. The circumstances that may indicate a transaction is not orderly could include:       ·  The seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership or the seller was required to sell the asset to meet regulatory requirements;     ·  There was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset to a single market participant; and     ·  The transaction price is significantly different relative to other similar transactions.   Transactions that are deemed not orderly would not be determinative of fair value or of market participant risk premiums. In estimating fair value, an entity should place more weight on transactions that it concludes are orderly. Less weight should be placed on transactions that the reporting entity does not have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction is orderly.   As of June 30, 2009, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions.    Derivatives   To protect us from a variety of equity market and interest rate risks that are inherent in many of our life insurance and annuity products, we use various derivative instruments. Assessing the effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates. We use derivatives to hedge equity market risks, interest rate risk and foreign currency exposures that are embedded in our annuity and life insurance product liabilities or investment portfolios. Derivatives held as of June 30, 2009, contain industry standard terms. Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential impact on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits   We have a dynamic hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk and income statement volatility caused by changes in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities associated with the Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) feature and our i4LIFE® Advantage and 4LATER® Advantage guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) features that are available in our variable annuity products. In early January 2008, we added the GLB features that are available in our variable annuity products in our New York insurance subsidiary, LLANY, to our hedge program. In February 2008, we also added our new GWB Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage to our hedging program. Our GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1 and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We weight these features and their associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature. In addition to mitigating selected risk and income statement volatility, the hedge program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits, recognizing that such claims are likely to begin no earlier than approximately a decade in the future.   If we were to experience unfavorable capital markets as we did late in 2008, then we would expect greater liabilities associated with the contractual guarantees. However, the relationship between the components of the guarantees, namely, the embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and the insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1, is not linear. As the exposure to net amount at risk increases, the relative portion of the projected benefits that is accounted for under SOP 03-1 increases relative to the portion that is accounted for under SFAS 133.   The hedging strategy is designed such that changes in the value of the hedge contracts move in the opposite direction of changes in the value of the embedded derivative portion of the GLB features. This dynamic hedging strategy utilizes options on U.S.-based equity indices, futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices and variance swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, as well as interest rate futures and swaps. The notional amounts of the underlying hedge instruments are such that the magnitude of the change in the value of the hedge instruments due to changes in equity markets, interest rates and implied volatilities is designed to offset the magnitude of the change in the fair value of the GLB guarantees caused by those same factors. As of June 30, 2009, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability, before adjustment for the NPR factors required by SFAS 157, for GWB, the i4LIFE® Advantage GIB and the 4LATER® Advantage GIB were valued at $746 million, $350 million and $101 million, respectively. See “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” for information on how we determine our NPR.               68        As part of our current hedging program, equity market, interest rate and market implied volatility conditions are monitored on a daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, our hedge positions may not be totally effective to offset changes in the fair value embedded derivative liability caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market implied volatilities, realized market volatility, contract holder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off. This hedging strategy is managed on a combined basis with the hedge for our GDB features.   For more information on our GDB hedging strategy, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations – Guaranteed Death Benefits” in our 2008 Form 10-K.   As of June 30, 2009, the fair value of our derivative assets, which hedge both our GLB and GDB features, and including margins generated by futures contracts, was $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2009, the sum of all GLB liabilities at fair value and GDB reserves was $1.4 billion, comprised of $1.2 billion for GLB liabilities and $0.2 billion for the GDB reserves. The fair value of the hedge assets exceeded the liabilities by $0.1 billion, which we believe indicates that the hedge strategy has performed well by providing funding for our best estimate of the present value of the liabilities related to our GLB and GDB features. However, the relationship of hedge assets to the liabilities for the guarantees may vary in any given reporting period due to market conditions, hedge performance and/or changes to the hedging strategy.   Approximately 36% of our variable annuity account values contain a GWB rider as of June 30, 2009. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits under the GWB contracts, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a GWB contract is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the guaranteed amount. As of June 30, 2009, and June 30, 2008, 75% and 65%, respectively, of all GWB in-force contracts were “in the money,” and our exposure to the guaranteed amounts, after reinsurance, as of June 30, 2009, and June 30, 2008, was $4.0 billion and $894 million respectively. Our exposure before reinsurance for these same periods was $4.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. However, the only way the GWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract is upon death or through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for our lifetime GWB products, the annuity payments can continue beyond the guaranteed amount. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the guaranteed amount over account value.   As a result of these factors, the ultimate amount to be paid by us related to GWB guarantees is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $4.0 billion, net of reinsurance. Our fair value estimates of the GWB liabilities, which are based on detailed models of future cash flows under a wide range of market-consistent scenarios, reflect a more comprehensive view of the related factors and represent our best estimate of the present value of these potential liabilities. The market-consistent scenarios used in the determination of the fair value of the GWB liabilities are similar to those used by an investment bank to value derivatives for which the pricing is not transparent and the aftermarket is nonexistent or illiquid. In our calculation, risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulations resulting in over 10 million scenarios are utilized to value the entire block of guarantees. The market-consistent scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant. The market consistent inputs include assumptions for the capital markets (e.g., implied volatilities, correlation among indices, risk-free swap curve, etc.), policyholder behavior (e.g., policy lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, etc.), risk margins, administrative expenses and a margin for profit. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. It is possible that different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce a materially different estimate of fair value.   For information on our GLB hedging results, see our discussion in “Realized Loss” below.        69       Income Taxes   The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, including our capital loss deferred tax asset, will be realized. For additional information on our income taxes, see Note 7 in this report and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Acquisitions and Dispositions   For information about acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 in this report and “Part I – Item 1.

The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:       ·  A $139 million impairment of goodwill and our Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) license intangible assets on our remaining radio clusters in the second quarter of 2008 attributable to declines in advertising revenues for the entire radio market;     ·  A $23 million favorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees in the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to the decrease in the change in GDB reserves as a result of variable account growth, compared to a $4 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking in the second quarter of 2008 due primarily to lower premiums received and higher death claims, partially offset by higher investment income on alternative investments and prepayment and bond makewhole premiums than our model projections assumed; and     ·  Lower underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due primarily to lower asset-based expenses as a result of declines in variable account values from a lower level of the equity markets for the second quarter of 2009, lower merger expenses as many of our integration efforts related to our acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot have been completed and the implementation of several expense management initiatives, partially offset by restructuring charges related to many of these initiatives.   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Net income decreased due primarily to the following:        ·  Impairment of goodwill in the first quarter of 2009 of $600 million for Retirement Solutions – Individual Annuities due to continued market volatility, the corresponding increase in discount rates and lower annuity sales compared to $139 million of impairment of goodwill and our FCC license intangible assets on our remaining radio clusters in the second quarter of 2008 attributable to declines in advertising revenues for the entire radio market (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” above for additional information on our goodwill impairment); however, these non-cash impairments did not impact our liquidity and will not impact our future liquidity;     ·  The $170 million loss on disposition of our Lincoln UK segment during the second quarter of 2009 (see Note 3 for additional information on the disposition of our discontinued operations);     ·  Lower earnings from our variable annuity and mutual fund products and lower investment advisory fees as a result of declines in assets under management caused by decreases in the equity markets;     ·  Higher benefits due primarily to an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments from the decline in account values below guaranteed levels attributable to unfavorable equity markets and the increase in reserves for products with secondary guarantees from continued growth in the business;     ·  A $107 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and the reserves for annuity and life insurance products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees during the first six months of 2009 due primarily to the overall performance of our GLB derivative program (see “Realized Loss” below for more information on our GLB derivative performance) and the impact of lower equity market performance and higher lapses than our model projections assumed, compared to a $11 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2008 due primarily to lower premiums received and higher death claims than our model projections assumed and model adjustments on certain life insurance policies;     ·  The overall unfavorable GLB net derivatives results, excluding unlocking, in the first six months of 2009, which was due to a reduction in the NPR component of the liability that is not included in the hedge program, partially offset by favorable hedge program effectiveness driven by strong underlying fund performance and by being modestly under hedged on interest rates as we adjust our hedge program to better align with statutory reserving (see “Realized Loss” below for more information on our GLB liability and derivative performance);     ·  The $64 million unfavorable impact of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re in the first quarter of 2009, as discussed in “Reinsurance” below;     ·  An increase in realized losses on our AFS securities; and            74             ·  Lower net investment income attributable primarily to less favorable investment income on surplus and alternative investments due primarily to a deterioration of the capital markets (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information on our alternative investments) as well as holding higher cash balances related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield.   The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following:       ·  Lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest and excluding unlocking, and lower asset-based expenses due primarily to declines in variable account values from unfavorable equity markets during the first six months of 2009;     ·  A $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2009 associated with the early extinguishment of long-term debt;     ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items;     ·  Lower broker-dealer expenses due primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products, lower merger expenses as many of our integration efforts related to our acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot have been completed and the implementation of several expense initiatives, partially offset by restructuring charges related to many of these initiatives; and     ·  The $16 million impact of the initial adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008.   The foregoing items are discussed in further detail in results of operations by segment discussions and “Realized Loss” below.

(2)  The segment’s benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves was $(116) million and $(25) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, driven by variable account growth, as compared to $3 million and $15 million in the corresponding periods of 2008; however, this impact is offset within operating realized gain (loss) as discussed below.     (3)  Other revenues and fees consists primarily of broker-dealer earnings that are subject to market volatility.           76         Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·  Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values due to unfavorable equity markets;     ·  Lower net investment income attributable primarily to higher cash balances related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 33 basis points and a decline in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information), partially offset by net flows for fixed annuities, including the fixed portion of variable;     ·  Higher benefits, net of benefit ratio unlocking in operating realized gain (loss), due primarily to an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments from the decline in account values below guaranteed levels attributable to unfavorable equity markets; and     ·  Higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding amortization of DAC and VOBA, due to higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see discussion in “Additional Segment Information” below) and our stock-based incentive compensation awards being granted during the second quarter of 2009 as these awards were granted during the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by lower account-value-based trail commissions related to the impact of unfavorable equity markets on account values.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by a reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to the decrease in earnings as our separate account DRD was essentially flat period over period.   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·  Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values due to unfavorable equity markets;     ·  Higher benefits, net of benefit ratio unlocking in operating realized gain (loss), due primarily to an increase in our expected GDB benefit payments from the decline in account values below guaranteed levels attributable to unfavorable equity markets;     ·  Lower net investment income attributable primarily to higher cash balances related to our short-term liquidity strategy during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 37 basis points and a decline in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information), partially offset by higher average fixed account values due to favorable fixed net flows since June 30, 2008;     ·  A $2 million unfavorable retrospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and reserves for our guarantee riders during the first six months of 2009 due primarily to higher lapses, higher death benefit costs and the impact of lower equity market performance than our model projections assumed, compared to a $3 million favorable retrospective unlocking during the first six months of 2008 due primarily to the impact of higher equity market performance than our model projections assumed; and     ·  A less favorable net broker-dealer margin attributable primarily to lower sales of non-proprietary products and lower earnings due to lower production levels.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items; and     ·  Lower underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, lower account value-based trail commissions and other expenses driven by the declines in our variable account values from unfavorable equity markets and the implementation of several expense management controls and practices that are focused on expense reduction initiatives.   Additional Segment Information   In the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2008 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our “prospective unlocking” process.        77        As a result of improvement in the capital markets and our recently executed capital plan, we expect to reduce our liquidity position by investing excess cash to a more historical normal level, which will improve our yields and levels of net investment income.   We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first six months of 2009, and the second half of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.   Although the segment’s results during the first six months of 2009 were unfavorably impacted by declining account values and the economic environment, its overall net flows were strong in a challenging economic environment. New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rates for our annuity products were 8% and 9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, compared to 8% for the corresponding periods in 2008. Although lapse rates for the six months ended June 30, 2009, have risen due primarily to the challenging economic environment, the overall increase is relatively moderate and still falls within pricing parameters.   See Note 9 above for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features.   We expect to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of crediting rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Account values for these products, including the fixed portion of variable, were $7.1 billion as of June 30, 2009, with 67% already at their minimum guaranteed rates. The average crediting rates for these products were approximately 37 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Business – Falling Rates” in our 2008 Form 10-K.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in Part II – Item 1A.

These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Realized Loss – Operating Realized Gain (Loss) – GLB” below for discussion of these attributed fees.           80        Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:             For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                      estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 235     $ 224       5 %   $ 458     $ 453       1 %  Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond                                                  makewhole premiums (1)     -       -      NM       1       1       0 %  Alternative investments (2)     -       -      NM       (1 )     (1 )     0 %  Surplus investments (3)     9       20       -55 %     26       38       -32 %  Broker-dealer     -       1       -100 %     -       2       -100 %  Total net investment income   $ 244     $ 245       0 %   $ 484     $ 493       -2 %                                                    Interest Credited                                                  Amount provided to contract holders   $ 172     $ 180       -4 %   $ 343     $ 363       -6 %  DSI deferrals     (19 )     (26 )     27 %     (34 )     (52 )     35 %  Interest credited before DSI amortization     153       154       -1 %     309       311       -1 %  DSI amortization:                                                  Retrospective unlocking     (7 )     -      NM       (2 )     -      NM    Amortization, excluding unlocking     18       9       100 %     18       14       29 %  Total interest credited   $ 164     $ 163       1 %   $ 325     $ 325       0 %       (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves is calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives and collateral. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, plus the immediate annuity reserve change (included within benefits) divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, net of coinsured account values. Fixed account values reinsured under modified coinsurance agreements are included in account values for this calculation. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves on immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in reserves on GDBs and changes in the reserves for the SOP 03-1 portion of the GLB reserves.   The changes in reserves attributable to the segment’s benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders is offset in operating realized gain (loss).

Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:        ·  Lower insurance fees driven primarily by lower average daily variable account values resulting from the unfavorable equity markets and an overall shift in business mix toward products with lower expense assessment rates; and     ·  Higher interest credited driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed since the second quarter of 2008.   The decrease in income from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009, was partially offset by the following:       ·  Lower underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, excluding unlocking, due primarily to lower DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest, driven by the declines in our variable account values from unfavorable equity markets;     ·  A reduction in federal income tax expense due primarily to favorable tax return true-ups driven by the separate account DRD, foreign tax credit adjustments and other items; and     ·  Higher net investment income driven primarily by higher average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, driven by transfers from variable to fixed, partially offset by our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets that has reduced our portfolio yield by 17 basis points and a decline in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information).         84        Additional Segment Information   In the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and the calculations of the embedded derivatives and reserves for annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2008 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our “prospective unlocking” process.   As a result of improvement in the capital markets and our recently executed capital plan, we expect to reduce our liquidity position by investing excess cash to a more historical normal level, which will improve our yields and levels of net investment income.   We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first six months of 2009, and the second half of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly impact current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rates for our annuity products were 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, compared to 13% and 15% for the corresponding periods in 2008.   Due to an expected overall shift in business mix towards products with lower expense assessment rates, a substantial increase in new deposit production will be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.   See Note 9 above for information on contractual guarantees to contract holders related to GDB features.   We expect to manage the effect of changing market investment returns by managing interest rate spreads for near-term income from operations through a combination of crediting rate actions and portfolio management. Our expectation includes the assumption that there are no significant changes in net flows in or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectation. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.

The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding the amounts attributable to our surplus investments, reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, inter-segment cash management program interest expense and interest on collateral, divided by average invested assets on reserves. The average invested assets on reserves are calculated based upon total invested assets, excluding hedge derivatives. The average crediting rate is calculated as interest credited before DSI amortization, divided by the average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves on GDBs and changes in the reserves for the SOP 03-1 portion of GLB reserves.   The changes in reserves attributable to the segment’s benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders is offset in operating realized loss.

We do not pay commissions on sales of our mutual fund products, and distribution expenses associated with the sale of these mutual fund products are expensed as they are incurred.         91        RESULTS OF INSURANCE SOLUTIONS   The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) products. The Insurance Solutions – Group Protection segment offers group life, disability and dental insurance to employers.

Additional Segment Information   The coinsurance agreement that we entered into on March 31, 2009, resulted in a pre-tax deferred loss of $53 million, and approximately $2 million annually will be amortized into income from operations prospectively over 20 years. As a result of this agreement, this segment’s income from operations will be reduced by approximately $7 million per quarter as a result of reductions in insurance fees, net investment income, interest credited and benefits that we had not experienced prior to the second quarter of 2009. This unfavorable impact will be partially offset by an approximate $2 million increase to income from operations in Other Operations, as a result of having higher net investment income due to the transfer of assets from Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance attributable to its reduction in capital as a result of this coinsurance agreement; therefore, we expect our net impact from this transaction to our consolidated net income will be a reduction of $5 million per quarter. See “Reinsurance” below for more information.   As of December 31, 2008, we released approximately $240 million of capital that had previously supported our UL products with secondary guarantees as a result of executing on a reinsurance transaction that resulted in the release of statutory reserves related to the Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“AG38”). This reduction in capital lowered the level of assets supporting this business, as assets were transferred to Other Operations, and caused an approximate $4 million per quarter ongoing reduction in this segment’s net investment income.   A portion of the retrospective and prospective unlocking of DAC, VOBA, DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves in 2008 resulted in an unfavorable recurring earnings impact of $7 million per quarter that began in the third quarter of 2008.   On March 1, 2009, we implemented a 15 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points. On June 1, 2008, we implemented a 10 basis point decrease in crediting rates on most interest-sensitive products not already at contractual guarantees, which has increased spreads by approximately 5 basis points.   As of June 30, 2009, 72% of interest-sensitive account values had crediting rates at contract guaranteed levels, and 15% had crediting rates within 50 basis points of contractual guarantees. Going forward, we expect to be able to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through a combination of rate actions and portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant impact on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest; however, results for 2008 were muted given the economic conditions.   In the third quarter of each year, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and models used for our estimates of future gross profits underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA and DFEL and secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2008 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our “prospective unlocking” process.   We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first six months of 2009, and the second half of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.           93        Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.

Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience. In-force growth should be considered independently with respect to term products versus UL and other products, as term products have a lower profitability relative to face amount compared to whole life and interest-sensitive products.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:        ·  UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including COLI and BOLI) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums;     ·  MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of premium deposits; and     ·  Whole life and term – 100% of first year paid premiums.  UL and VUL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 38% of interest-sensitive life insurance in force as of June 30, 2009, and approximately 67% and 70% of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. AG38 imposes additional statutory reserve requirements for these products.           95        Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:            For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real                                      estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 486     $ 473       3 %   $ 966     $ 947       2 %  Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                  bond makewhole premiums (1)     4       9       -56 %     4       13       -69 %  Alternative investments (2)     (49 )     14      NM       (53 )     14      NM    Surplus investments (3)     12       23       -48 %     34       45       -24 %  Total net investment income   $ 453     $ 519       -13 %   $ 951     $ 1,019       -7 %                                                    Interest Credited   $ 291     $ 301       -3 %   $ 594     $ 597       -1 %       (1)  See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to contract holder accounts. Invested assets will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements, which cause statutory reserves to grow at an accelerated rate. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are therefore affected by various reserve adjustments, including capital transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, which leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. The interest rate spread for this segment represents the excess of the yield on invested assets on reserves over the average crediting rate on interest-sensitive products. The yield on invested assets on reserves is calculated as net investment income, excluding amounts attributable to our surplus investments and reverse repurchase agreement interest expense, divided by average invested assets on reserves. In addition, we exclude the impact of earnings from affordable housing tax credit securities, which is reflected as a reduction to federal income tax expense, from our spread calculations. Traditional products use interest income to build the policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

In addition, benefits includes the change in reserves for our products with secondary guarantees. The reserve for secondary guarantees is impacted by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Additionally, we establish a reserve for reinsurance margin (reinsurance premiums paid less death benefit recoveries) and amortize this margin over the life of the expected insurance assessments for certain blocks of secondary guarantee UL business. When we experience unfavorable mortality, particularly on higher face amount claims, our reinsurance recoveries can increase significantly and are deferred, which reduces the amount by which the expense for the direct claims are offset by reinsurance. The reinsurance on our secondary guarantee UL business is excess of loss reinsurance, and this block has a large range of face amounts, both of which contribute to volatility in our actual experience of reinsurance recoveries as compared to our expectations.

For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business.   When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, the increase is a result of incurred deferrable general and administrative expenses declining at a rate lower than sales.           98        Insurance Solutions – Group Protection   Income from Operations   Details underlying the results for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                                      Insurance premiums   $ 413     $ 393       5 %   $ 803     $ 763       5 %  Net investment income     28       31       -10 %     58       58       0 %  Other revenues and fees     2       1       100 %     3       3       0 %  Total operating revenues     443       425       4 %     864       824       5 %  Operating Expenses                                                  Interest credited     1       -      NM       1       -      NM    Benefits     292       287       2 %     575       555       4 %  Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other                                                  expenses     98       89       10 %     197       179       10 %  Total operating expenses     391       376       4 %     773       734       5 %  Income from operations before taxes     52       49       6 %     91       90       1 %  Federal income tax expense     18       17       6 %     32       32       0 %  Income from operations   $ 34     $ 32       6 %   $ 59     $ 58       2 %           For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Income from Operations by Product Line                                      Life   $ 13     $ 11       18 %   $ 13     $ 21       -38 %  Disability     20       20       0 %     46       36       28 %  Dental     (1 )     -      NM       (3 )     (1 )    NM    Total non-medical     32       31       3 %     56       56       0 %  Medical     2       1       100 %     3       2       50 %  Total income from operations   $ 34     $ 32       6 %   $ 59     $ 58       2 %   Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations for this segment increased due to the following:        ·  More favorable total non-medical loss ratio experience, slightly below the low end of our expected range; and     ·  Growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products.    The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following:       ·  An increase to underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses due primarily to higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information) and the increase in paid premiums, partially offset by higher costs of investments in strategic initiatives associated with realigning our marketing and distribution structure in 2008; and     ·  When comparing the three months ended June 30, 2009 to 2008, the increase in income from operations was also partially offset by lower net investment income driven by a decline in investment income on surplus investments due primarily to less favorable investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for additional information).         99        During the first six months of 2009, we experienced exceptional short- and long-term disability loss ratios due primarily to favorable claims incidence and termination experience. We attribute the recent favorable incidence and termination experience in our long-term disability line of business to be related, at least in part, to the impact of the challenging economic environment on our insureds. Consequently, we expect to experience non-medical loss ratios over the remainder of this year at the low end of our historical expected range of 71% to 74%. In addition, we experienced unfavorable life loss ratios in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to adverse mortality experience, the one-time adjustment noted below and the downward effects of whole-case pricing on premium rates, all of which we do not expect to recur in future quarters.   Benefits included a one-time adjustment of $3 million in the first quarter of 2009 relating to unfavorable waiver claim reserves.   We experienced higher expenses attributable to our U.S. pension plans (see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans” in our 2008 Form 10-K) during the first six months of 2009, and the second half of 2009 will continue this unfavorable trend when compared to the corresponding period in 2008.   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.   Management focuses on trends in loss ratios to compare actual experience with pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claim experience is inherently uncertain. As discussed further above, we expect favorable loss ratio experience over the remainder of this year.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.   The business represented as “medical” consists primarily of our non-core EXEC-U-CARE® product. This product provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non-covered health plan costs. This product produces significant revenues and benefits expenses for this segment but only a limited amount of income. Discontinuance of this product would significantly impact segment revenues, but not income from operations.   Net Investment Income   We use our interest income to build the associated policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.           100        Benefits and Interest Credited   Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Benefits and Interest Credited by Product Line          Life   $ 104     $ 97       7 %   $ 220     $ 192       15 %  Disability     107       111       -4 %     210       221       -5 %  Dental     32       30       7 %     64       60       7 %  Total non-medical     243       238       2 %     494       473       4 %  Medical     50       49       2 %     82       82       0 %  Total benefits and interest credited   $ 293     $ 287       2 %   $ 576     $ 555       4 %                                                    Loss Ratios by Product Line                                                  Life     70.3 %     72.3 %             75.8 %     72.1 %          Disability     62.4 %     66.1 %             60.8 %     67.1 %          Dental     86.1 %     81.1 %             85.2 %     81.0 %          Total non-medical     68.2 %     70.2 %             69.5 %     70.6 %          Medical     88.1 %     88.6 %             88.4 %     88.2 %           Note: Loss ratios presented above are calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.

Broker commissions, which vary with and are related to paid premiums, are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.           101        RESULTS OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT   The Investment Management segment, through Delaware Investments, provides a broad range of managed account portfolios, mutual funds, sub-advised funds and other investment products to individual investors and to institutional investors such as private and public pension funds, foundations and endowment funds.

Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Income from operations decreased due primarily to the following:       ·  A reduction in investment advisory fees due to lower assets under management resulting primarily from unfavorable equity markets and the impact of negative net flows in 2008; and     ·  A reduction in other revenues and fees attributable primarily to lower 12b-1 fees, administrative service fees and shareholder servicing revenue as a result of lower assets under management, partially offset by favorable seed capital results driven by favorable equity markets during the second quarter of 2009.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by lower asset-based expenses and the implementation of expense reduction initiatives.           102        Additional Segment Information   We expect lower earnings for this segment in 2009 than we experienced in 2008 due primarily to lower investment advisory fees, partially offset by lower asset-based expenses, due to the assets under management erosion from unfavorable equity market returns and negative net flows experienced during 2008.   The level of net flows may vary considerably from period to period, and, therefore, results in one period are not indicative of net flows in subsequent periods.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   We provide information about certain of this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

Investment advisory fees – external includes amounts that are ultimately paid to sub-advisors for managing the sub-advised assets. The amounts paid to sub-advisors are generally included in the segment’s expenses.   Investment advisory fees – inter-segment consists of fees for asset management services this segment provides to Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions for managing general account assets supporting fixed income products, surplus and separate account assets. These inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as they are eliminated along with the associated expenses incurred by Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions. Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions report the cost as a reduction to net investment income, which is the same methodology that would be used if these services were provided by an external party.   Other Revenues and Fees   Other revenues and fees consists primarily of revenues generated from shareholder and administrative services, 12b-1 fees and the results from seed capital investments. The distribution expenses paid to brokers that sell affiliated mutual funds shares are classified within underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses. Seed capital investments are important to establishing a track record for products that will later be sold to investors. These investments are valued at market value each reporting period and the change in market value impacts other revenues. During the second quarter of 2009, this segment began hedging the majority of the equity exposure of its seed capital investments with a total return swap, which expires in October 2009.           105        RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Other Operations includes investments related to the excess capital in our insurance subsidiaries, investments in media properties and other corporate investments, benefit plan net assets, the unamortized deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance, which was sold to Swiss Re in 2001, external debt and business sold through reinsurance. We are actively managing our remaining radio station clusters to maximize performance and future value. Other Operations also includes the Institutional Pension business, which is a closed block of pension business, the majority of which was sold on a group annuity basis, and is currently in run-off, and the results of certain disability income business due to the rescission of this business previously sold to Swiss Re.   Loss from Operations   Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Operating Revenues                                      Insurance premiums   $ 3     $ 2       50 %   $ 3     $ 3       0 %  Net investment income     70       87       -20 %     139       186       -25 %  Amortization of deferred gain on business                                                   sold through reinsurance     18       18       0 %     37       37       0 %  Media revenues (net)     19       23       -17 %     34       45       -24 %  Other revenues and fees     1       1       0 %     4       (3 )     233 %  Inter-segment elimination of investment                                                   advisory fees     (20 )     (21 )     5 %     (40 )     (41 )     2 %  Total operating revenues     91       110       -17 %     177       227       -22 %  Operating Expenses                                                  Interest credited     31       42       -26 %     82       86       -5 %  Benefits     36       29       24 %     143       57       151 %  Media expenses     13       15       -13 %     26       31       -16 %  Other expenses     57       48       19 %     91       85       7 %  Interest and debt expenses     61       65       -6 %     126       140       -10 %  Inter-segment elimination of investment                                                  advisory fees     (20 )     (21 )     5 %     (40 )     (41 )     2 %  Total operating expenses     178       178       0 %     428       358       20 %  Loss from operations before taxes     (87 )     (68 )     -28 %     (251 )     (131 )     -92 %  Federal income tax benefit     (34 )     (24 )     -42 %     (92 )     (45 )    NM    Loss from operations   $ (53 )   $ (44 )     -20 %   $ (159 )   $ (86 )     -85 %   Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Loss from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·  Higher other expenses attributable primarily to restructuring charges of $19 million in the second quarter of 2009 related to expense reduction initiatives that are discussed further below, partially offset by higher merger-related expenses in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems;     ·  Lower net investment income from a reduction in invested assets driven by transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairments and dividends paid to stockholders as these items exceeded the distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt, and lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock due to dividend rate cuts, partially offset by proceeds from our common stock issuance in the second quarter of 2009;     ·  Unfavorable results of our run-off disability income business due primarily to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement discussed below; and     ·  Lower media earnings related primarily to the general weakening of the U.S economy causing substantial declines in revenues throughout the radio market.         106        The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and lower average balances of outstanding debt in the current period.   Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   Loss from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:       ·  The $64 million unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2009 of the rescission of the reinsurance agreement on certain disability income business sold to Swiss Re as discussed in “Reinsurance” below, which resulted in pre-tax increases in benefits of $78 million, interest credited of $15 million and other expenses of $5 million, partially offset by a $34 million tax benefit;     ·  Higher other expenses attributable primarily to restructuring charges of $22 million during the first six months of 2009 related to expense reduction initiatives that are discussed further below, partially offset by higher merger-related expenses during the first six months of 2008 as a result of higher system integration work related to our administrative systems and relocation costs in the first quarter of 2008 associated with the move of our corporate office;     ·  Lower net investment income from a reduction in invested assets driven by transfers to other segments for other-than-temporary impairments and dividends paid to stockholders as these items exceeded the distributable earnings received from our insurance segments, dividends received from our other segments and issuances of debt, and lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock due to dividend rate cuts partially offset by proceeds from our common stock issuance in the second quarter of 2009;     ·  Lower media earnings related primarily to the general weakening of the U.S economy causing substantial declines in revenues throughout the radio market; and     ·  Unfavorable results of our run-off disability income business due primarily to the rescission discussed above.   The increase in loss from operations was partially offset by lower interest and debt expenses as a result of a decline in interest rates that affect our variable rate borrowings and lower average balances of outstanding debt in 2009.   Additional Segment Information   We expect lower media earnings in 2009 than was experienced in 2008, as our customers have reduced their advertising expenses in response to the economic conditions.   We expect lower investment income in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to lower dividend income from our holdings of Bank of America common stock as it announced dividend rate cuts during the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by higher investment income of $2 million per quarter prospectively related to the coinsurance agreement that we entered into on March 31, 2009 (see “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” and “Reinsurance” for more information) and by the net investment income earned on the proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and debt during the second quarter of 2009 and preferred stock and a common stock warrant in July 2009, which is discussed in more detail below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities.”   The inclusion of run-off disability income business results within Other Operations due to the rescission of the Swiss Re reinsurance agreement mentioned above may create volatility in earnings going forward. As part of our transition plan related to the rescission, we expect to complete a reserve study to determine whether or not reserves are adequate to cover contract holder obligations. The completion of this study could result in an adjustment to the reserves that we have assumed from Swiss Re pursuant to the rescission agreement.   Sustained market volatility and the challenging economic environment continue to put pressure on many industries and companies, including our own. After reviewing the impact of this difficult economy on our anticipated sales and business activities, we initiated actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 to streamline operations, reduce expenses and ensure that staffing levels were aligned with expected business activity. Additionally, we initiated a second expense reduction initiative in April 2009, as discussed below. We focused on reducing the workforce, reducing capital spending and addressing corporate-wide discretionary spending.   As a result of shrinking revenues due to the impact of unfavorable equity markets on our asset management businesses and a reduction in sales volumes caused by the unfavorable economic environment, we launched further initiatives to reduce expenses, including a 12% workforce reduction that was substantially completed in April of 2009, that we believe will improve our capital position and preserve profits. The restructuring costs associated with these layoffs are included in other expenses within Other Operations.           107        For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital allocated to Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed below in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” we maintain an inter-segment cash management program where certain subsidiaries can borrow from or lend money to the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The inter-segment cash management program affects net investment income for Other Operations, as all inter-segment eliminations are reported within Other Operations.   Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an impact on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.   The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions resulting in some of the business still flowing through our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no impact to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.   Other Expenses   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:            For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Other Expenses                                      Merger-related expenses   $ 4     $ 16       -75 %   $ 11     $ 31       -65 %  Restructuring charges for expense initiatives     29       -      NM       34       -      NM    Branding     4       11       -64 %     9       18       -50 %  Retirement Income Security Ventures     2       2       0 %     4       4       0 %  Taxes, licenses and fees     1       1       0 %     2       3       -33 %  Other     17       18       -6 %     31       29       7 %  Total other expenses   $ 57     $ 48       19 %   $ 91     $ 85       7 %   Other in the table above includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, certain litigation reserves, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, other expenses not allocated to our business segments and inter-segment expense eliminations, excluding those associated with our inter-segment investment advisory fees.         108        Merger-related expenses were the result of actions undertaken by us to eliminate duplicate operations and functions as a result of the Jefferson-Pilot merger along with costs related to the implementation of our new unified product portfolio and other initiatives. Although these actions were substantially completed in the first half of 2009, we expect to incur up to $10 million of merger-related expenses during the remainder of 2009. Our current estimate of the cumulative integration expenses is approximately $215 million to $225 million, pre-tax, and excludes amounts capitalized or recorded as goodwill.   Starting in December 2008, we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the current economic downturn and sustained market volatility, which focused on reducing expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $8 million. The expenses associated with this initiative are reported in restructuring charges for expense initiatives above. We expect our cumulative pre-tax charges to amount to approximately $43 million for severance, benefits and related costs associated with the plan for workforce reduction and other restructuring actions.   Interest and Debt Expenses   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   For information on our counterparty exposure see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Comparison of the Three and Six Months ended June 30, 2009 to 2008   GLB net derivative results declined due primarily to the NPR component of the liability being unfavorable in 2009 attributable to a reduction in the liability and to a lesser extent the decline in the NPR factors when compared to the corresponding NPR factors in place for the beginning balances (i.e., March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008). This decline was partially offset by favorable changes in the hedge program effectiveness attributable primarily to impacts of changes in interest rate risk. See “GLB Net Derivative Results” below for a discussion of how our NPR adjustment is determined.   The unfavorable net GDB derivative results were driven primarily by sporadic large movements in rates and equities that caused non-linear changes in the liability relative to the derivatives utilized in the hedge program and by other items.   The loss for the three months ended June 30, 2009, and the gain for the first six months of 2009 on reinsurance derivative/trading securities was due primarily to the rescission of the Swiss Re indemnity reinsurance agreement covering certain disability income business, whereby we released the embedded derivative liability related to the funds withheld nature of the reinsurance agreement. This release of the embedded derivative liability increased net income by approximately $31 million. Since the rescission, this line item is impacted by market conditions as we now have trading securities that are no longer related to an embedded derivative due to the rescission. For more information, see “Reinsurance” below and Note 11.

The change in the fair value of the liability for the embedded derivative represents the amount that is credited to the indexed annuity contract.   GLB   Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1 and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We weight these features and their associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature. For our GLBs that meet the definition of an embedded derivative under SFAS 133, we record them at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in realized loss on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). In bifurcating the embedded derivative, we attribute to the embedded derivative the portion of total fees collected from the contract holder that relates to the GLB riders (the “attributed fees”). These attributed fees represent the present value of future claims expected to be paid for the GLB at the inception of the contract (the “net valuation premium”) plus a margin that a theoretical market participant would include for risk/profit (the “risk/profit margin”).           111        Our methodology for calculating the NPR component of the liability utilizes an extrapolated 30-year NPR spread curve applied to each of the durational expected cash flows. We utilize a model based on our holding company’s CDS spreads adjusted for factors, such as the liquidity of our holding company CDS. Because the guaranteed benefit liabilities are contained within our insurance subsidiaries, we apply factors, such as the impact of our insurance subsidiaries’ claims-paying ratings compared to holding company credit risk and the over-collateralization of insurance liabilities, in order to determine factors that are representative of a theoretical market participant’s view of the NPR of the specific liability within our insurance subsidiaries.   Our CDS spreads as illustrated by the spread of our 10-year CDS used in the computation of our NPR factors at June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, were 5.52%, 23.25% and 6.34%, respectively. The corresponding NPR factors at June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, for the 10-year point was 0.82%, 1.49% and 1.23%, respectively.   For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, there was significant widening of our CDS spreads. We compared our CDS spreads to those of our peer companies with similar holding company ratings and determined that our company specific spreads were significantly wider due to the market’s concerns over our holding company liquidity. As a result, we reduced the spreads used in the calculation of our NPR factors to be in line with our peers. Therefore, the starting point for our spreads was reduced over the entire term structure with the 10-year at 8.45%.   The reduction in the derivative liability from the application of the NPR factors: at June 30, 2009, was $125 million, or approximately 10% of the unadjusted liability of $1.2 billion; at March 31, 2009, the reduction was $459 million, or approximately 15% of the unadjusted liability of $3.1 billion; and at December 31, 2008, the reduction was $514 million or approximately 15% of the unadjusted liability of $3.4 billion.   The $334 million change in the NPR component of the liability from March 31, 2009, to June 30, 2009, was primarily attributable to a $1.9 billion reduction in the unadjusted liability, with approximately $20 million of the change in NPR component attributable to a change in the NPR factors. Under our approach and factoring in the range of CDS spreads observed over the last three quarters, we estimate that the component of the liability recorded for NPR should range from 10% to 20% of the unadjusted liability calculated before the application of the NPR factors. However, changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spread and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.   We include the risk/profit margin portion of the GLB attributed rider fees in operating realized gain and include the net valuation premium of the GLB attributed rider fees in excluded realized (loss). For our Retirement Solutions – Annuities and Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution segments, the excess of total fees collected from the contract holders over the GLB attributed rider fees is reported in insurance fees.   We also include the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the benefit ratio unlocking of our SOP 03-1 reserves on our GLB riders. These changes in reserves attributable to Retirement Solutions’ benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GLB riders and associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL is offset in benefits within income from operations. This approach excludes the benefit ratio unlocking from income from operations according to our definition of income from operations and instead reflects it within GLB net derivatives results, a component of excluded realized (loss). On our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), the benefit ratio unlocking is reported within benefits.   GDB   GDB represents the change in the fair value of the derivatives that offsets the benefit ratio unlocking of our SOP 03-1 reserves on our GDB riders, including our expected cost of the hedging instruments. These changes in reserves attributable to Retirement Solutions’ benefit ratio unlocking of its SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders and associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL is offset in benefits within income from operations. This approach excludes the benefit ratio unlocking from income from operations according to our definition of income from operations and instead reflects it within GDB derivatives results, a component of excluded realized (loss). On our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), the benefit ratio unlocking is reported within benefits.   Realized Loss Related to Certain Investments   See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Loss Related to Investments” below.           112        Gain (Loss) on Certain Reinsurance Derivative/Trading Securities   Gain (loss) on certain reinsurance derivative/trading securities represents changes in the fair values of total return swaps (embedded derivatives) theoretically included in our various modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance arrangements that have contractual returns related to various assets and liabilities associated with these arrangements.

GLB Net Derivatives Results   Our GLB net derivatives results are comprised of the net valuation premium, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our GLB products and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge. This includes the cost of purchasing the hedging instruments.           113        Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under SOP 03-1 and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. The SOP 03-1 component is calculated in a manner consistent with our GDB. We weight these features and their associated reserves accordingly based on their hybrid nature. For the GLB guarantees in our variable annuity products that are considered embedded derivatives, we record them on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to the risks and earnings volatility that result from the embedded derivatives for GLBs. The change in fair value of these derivative instruments is designed to generally offset the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives. In the table above, we have presented the components of our GLB results, which can be volatile especially when sudden and significant changes in equity markets and/or interest rates occur. When we assess the effectiveness of our hedge program, we exclude the impact of the change in the liability related to the NPR required under SFAS 157. We do not attempt to hedge the change in the NPR component of the liability. The impact of the change in NPR has had the effect of reducing our GLB liabilities on our balance sheet by $125 million since the adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008. See above for information regarding the effect of the NPR on the GLB net derivatives results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. For additional information on our guaranteed benefits, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives – Guaranteed Living Benefits” above. For additional information on our hedge program see “Reinsurance” below.   Our GLB net derivatives results also include the benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves on our GLB riders. The benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves for GLB riders is offset in GLB operating realized gain (loss). See “GLB” above for additional information.   GDB Derivatives Results   Our GDB derivatives results represent the net difference between the benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves on our GDB riders and the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments we own to hedge the benefit ratio unlocking, excluding our expected cost of the hedging instruments. The benefit ratio unlocking of SOP 03-1 reserves for GDB riders is offset in GDB operating realized gain (loss). See “GDB” above for additional information.

The liability for the forward-starting option reflects changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities related to index call options we may purchase in the future to hedge contract holder index allocations applicable to future reset periods for our indexed annuity products as required under SFAS 133 and SFAS 157. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indications of volatility and interest rates, which can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both AFS and trading portfolios.           115        Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the below tables. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 5; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio; therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 5.

Refer to our 2008 Form 10-K “Trading Securities” section for further details.         117        AFS Securities   The general intent of the AFS accounting guidance is to reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and it is necessary that we consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:               Rating Agency      As of June 30, 2009      As of December 31, 2008    NAIC      Equivalent      Amortized      Fair      % of      Amortized      Fair      % of    Designation      Designation      Cost      Value      Total      Cost      Value      Total    Investment Grade Securities                                         1      Aaa / Aa / A     $ 32,062     $ 31,708       57.6 %   $ 31,847     $ 29,651       61.5 %   2      Baa       20,654       19,295       35.0 %     19,181       16,056       33.4 %  Total investment grade securities       52,716       51,003       92.6 %     51,028       45,707       94.9 %  Below Investment Grade Securities                                                     3      Ba       3,529       2,676       4.9 %     2,189       1,695       3.5 %   4     B       1,249       811       1.5 %     772       516       1.1 %   5      Caa and lower       799       400       0.7 %     250       130       0.3 %   6      In or near default       274       160       0.3 %     142       93       0.2 %  Total below investment grade securities       5,851       4,047       7.4 %     3,353       2,434       5.1 %  Total fixed maturity AFS securities     $ 58,567     $ 55,050       100.0 %   $ 54,381     $ 48,141       100.0 %                                                                  Total securities below investment grade as a percentage of total fixed maturity AFS securities       10.0 %     7.4 %             6.2 %     5.1 %         Comparisons between the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).   As of June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008, 84.5% and 92.3%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 5 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses on AFS securities decreased $2.2 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2009, which was attributable primarily to increased liquidity in several market segments and improved credit fundamentals, partially offset by, the cumulative adjustment of the recognition of OTTI, which resulted in the $165 million increase in amortized cost in AFS securities as discussed in Note 2. As more fully described in Note 5, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe that the securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2009, were not other-than-temporarily impaired as we do not intend to sell these debt securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our AFS securities unrealized losses, see “Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   The estimated fair value for all private securities was $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion as of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively, representing approximately 11% of total invested assets as of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008.         118        Our fixed maturity securities include mortgage-backed securities. These securities are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments. This may result in differences between the actual cash flow and maturity of these securities than that expected at the time of purchase. Securities that have an amortized cost greater than par and are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or a loss. Those securities with an amortized cost lower than par that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or a gain. In addition, we may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are lower than the book yields earned on the securities. Prepayments occurring slower than expected have the opposite impact. We may incur reinvestment risks if market yields are higher than the book yields earned on the securities and we are forced to sell the securities. The degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by: the difference between its amortized cost and par; the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayment in a changing interest rate environment; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure.   We limit the extent of our risk on mortgage-backed securities by prudently limiting exposure to the asset class, by generally avoiding the purchase of securities with a cost that significantly exceeds par, by purchasing securities backed by stable collateral and by concentrating on securities with enhanced priority in their trust structure. Such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield (but higher liquidity) than higher-risk mortgage-backed securities. At selected times, higher-risk securities may be purchased if they do not compromise the safety of the general portfolio. As of June 30, 2009, we did not have a significant amount of higher-risk, trust structured mortgage-backed securities. A significant amount of assets in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio are either guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or are supported in the securitization structure by junior securities enabling the assets to achieve high investment grade status.   Our exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investments in banks and other financial institutions that may be impacted by subprime lending and direct investments in ABS CDOs, ABS and residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Mortgage-related ABS are backed by home equity loans and RMBS are backed by residential mortgages. These securities are backed by loans that are characterized by borrowers of differing levels of creditworthiness: prime, Alt-A and subprime. Prime lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with excellent credit profiles. Alt-A lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have prime credit profiles but lack documentation to substantiate income. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weak or impaired credit profiles.   The slowing U.S. housing market, increased interest rates for non-prime borrowers and relaxed underwriting standards over the last several years have led to higher delinquency rates for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. We expect delinquency rates and loss rates on residential mortgages and home equity loans to increase in the future; however, we continue to expect to receive payments in accordance with contractual terms for a significant amount of our securities, largely due to the seniority of the claims on the collateral of the securities that we own. The tranches of the securities will experience losses according to their seniority level with the least senior (or most junior), typically the unrated residual tranche, taking the initial loss. The credit ratings of our securities reflect the seniority of the securities that we own. Our RMBS had a market value of $8.7 billion and an unrealized loss of $1.0 billion, or 12%, as of June 30, 2009. The unrealized loss was due primarily to deteriorating fundamentals and a general level of illiquidity in the market resulting in price declines in many structured products.           119        The market value of investments backed by subprime loans was $370 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of June 30, 2009. Investments rated A or above represented 68% of the subprime investments and $174 million in market value of our subprime investments was backed by loans originating in 2005 and forward. AFS securities represent $359 million, or 97%, of the subprime exposure and trading securities represent $11 million, or 3%, as of June 30, 2009.

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues such as municipal bonds and private placements as well as other types and structures of securities. Our direct exposure represents our bond holdings of the actual Monoline insurers. Our insured bonds represent our holdings in bonds of other issuers that are insured by Monoline insurers.

Additional Details on our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential impact of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.         124        We have no concentrations of issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity and equity securities.

Generally, below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely than investment grade securities to develop credit concerns. The remaining 64.4 % and 87.1% of the gross unrealized losses as of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively, relate to investment grade AFS securities. The ratios of estimated fair value to amortized cost reflected in the table below were not necessarily indicative of the market value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of these ratios subsequent to June 30, 2009.           130        Details underlying fixed maturity securities below investment grade and in an unrealized loss position (in millions) were as follows:             Ratio of    As of June 30, 2009        Amortized                Unrealized        Cost to    Fair      Amortized      Loss    Aging Category    Fair Value    Value      Cost      and OTTI    < or = 90 days    70% to 100%   $ 80     $ 86     $ 6        40% to 70%     116       227       111        Below 40%     36       135       99    Total < or = 90 days         232       448       216                                  >90 days but < or = 180 days    70% to 100%     79       91       12        40% to 70%     25       51       26        Below 40%     20       97       77    Total >90 days but < or = 180 days         124       239       115                                  >180 days but < or = 270 days    70% to 100%     125       135       10        40% to 70%     3       6       3        Below 40%     -

Changing economic conditions impact our valuation of mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that we perform for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) an allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have deteriorating credits or have experienced debt coverage reduction. Where warranted, we have established or increased loss reserves based upon this analysis. There were six impaired mortgage loans as of June 30, 2009, or 0.35% of total dollar amount of mortgage loans, and no impaired mortgage loans as of December 31, 2008. As of June 30, 2009, there were six commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. As of December 31, 2008, there were no commercial mortgage loans that were two or more payments delinquent. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans as of June 30, 2009, was $1 million or 0.6% of total mortgage loans. See Note 1 in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans.           133        Alternative Investments   The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions), which consists primarily of investments in limited partnerships, was as follows:            As of      As of        June 30,      December 31,        2009      2008    Retirement Solutions:              Annuities   $ 87     $ 89    Defined Contribution     69       72    Insurance Solutions:                  Life Insurance     520       603    Group Protection     35       8    Other Operations     (12 )     4    Total alternative investments   $ 699     $ 776     Income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:            For the Three        For the Six              Months Ended        Months Ended              June 30,        June 30,              2009      2008    Change    2009      2008      Change    Retirement Solutions:                                  Annuities   $ (8 )   $ -    NM   $ (8 )   $ (1 )    NM    Defined Contribution     (5 )     (1 )  NM     (5 )     (3 )     -67 %  Insurance Solutions:                                            Life Insurance     (56 )     14    NM     (62 )     13      NM    Group Protection     (3 )     -    NM     (3 )     -       NM    Other Operations     1       -    NM     1       (1 )     200 %  Total alternative investments (1)   $ (71 )   $ 13    NM   $ (77 )   $ 8      NM         (1)  Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.   The decline in our investment income on alternative investments in the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 presented in the table above was due to the impact of audit adjustments related to completion of calendar-year financial statement audits of the investees within our portfolio and continued deterioration of the financial markets. The nature of these adjustments is discussed further below. This weakness was concentrated primarily in our energy, domestic venture capital and real estate limited partnership holdings.   As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, alternative investments included investments in approximately 102 different partnerships. The partnerships represent a broadly diversified portfolio of asset classes. The investment strategy of the alternative investment portfolio is to provide incremental investment income compared to the traditional fixed-income and equity markets over a long term investment horizon. In addition, the portfolio represents approximately less than 1% of our overall invested assets. The portfolio is actively monitored to minimize the likelihood of material investment income losses.         134        The carrying value of our consolidated alternative investments by asset class (in millions) was as follows:            As of      As of        June 30,      December 31,        2009      2008                  Venture capital   $ 320     $ 341    Hedge funds     180       223    Real estate     100       110    Oil & gas     99       102    Total alternative investments   $ 699     $ 776     The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. The capital calls are included on the table of contingent commitments in “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our 2008 Form 10-K. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Our venture capital portfolio is mainly comprised of private equity investments in various leveraged buyout and venture capital limited partnerships, which in turn, invest in a well-diversified portfolio across various industry sectors, geographies, and investment stages. The objective of making such investments is to achieve an excess long-term risk-adjusted return.   The hedge fund portfolio is broadly diversified and contains exposure to the strategies which we believe will have the best long-term risk-adjusted returns.   The real estate limited partnership portfolio tries to capture value-added returns in both equity and mezzanine positions in both traditional and specialized areas of the commercial and residential real estate markets including workforce housing.   Similar to our venture capital portfolio, we invest in various oil-and-gas limited partnerships that target a well diversified energy sector including exploration and production, storage and distribution (midstream), oil field services, and other energy-related services.   We account for our investments in limited partnerships (“LPs”) using the equity method to determine the GAAP carrying value. The LPs where LNC is a participant generally report their assets at fair value. Since the assets of the LPs are measured at fair value and the values of the LPs’ liabilities would generally approximate fair value according to the audited financial statements received from the partnerships, the GAAP carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet would approximate a fair value for our LP investments.   Annually during the second quarter we obtain audited financial statements for our alternative investment partnerships for the preceding calendar year and recognize adjustments to the extent that audited equity of the investee differs from the equity used for reporting in prior quarters. Accordingly, our investment income from alternative investments for any calendar year period may not include the complete impact of the change in the underlying net assets for the partnership for that calendar year period. When we record investee audit adjustments it impacts our investment income from alternative investments in the period that the adjustments are recorded. Our investment income from alternative investments for the second quarter of 2009 included a pre-tax loss of $71 million, of which $57 million of the losses were attributable to audit adjustments to partnerships’ 2008 financial statements. The breakdown of these audit adjustments by segment were as follows: $50 million for Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance; $1 million for Insurance Solutions – Group Protection; $3 million for Retirement Solutions – Annuities; and $3 million for Retirement Solutions – Defined Contribution.   Non-Income Producing Investments   As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $32 million and $15 million, respectively.           135        Net Investment Income   Details underlying net investment income (loss) (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:            For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Net Investment Income                                      Fixed maturity AFS securities   $ 854     $ 835       2 %   $ 1,679     $ 1,677       0 %  Equity AFS securities     2       7       -71 %     3       16       -81 %  Trading securities     39       42       -7 %     79       85       -7 %  Mortgage loans on real estate     117       119       -2 %     236       235       0 %  Real estate     4       5       -20 %     6       11       -45 %  Standby real estate equity commitments     -       1       -100 %     1       2       -50 %  Policy loans     42       43       -2 %     86       88       -2 %  Invested cash     4       13       -69 %     12       29       -59 %  Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                                  bond makewhole premiums (1)     4       14       -71 %     4       19       -79 %  Alternative investments (2)     (71 )     13      NM       (77 )     8      NM    Consent fees     2       2       0 %     2       2       0 %  Other investments     2       (6 )     133 %     5       (4 )     225 %  Investment income     999       1,088       -8 %     2,036       2,168       -6 %  Investment expense     (28 )     (31 )     10 %     (52 )     (66 )     21 %  Net investment income   $ 971     $ 1,057       -8 %   $ 1,984     $ 2,102       -6 %       (1)  See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond makewhole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and therefore can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   The decline in net investment income when comparing the first six months of 2009 to the same period in 2008 was attributable to our liquidity strategy of maintaining higher cash balances during the recent volatile markets which has reduced our portfolio yield and a decline in investment income on alternative investments. We expect to reduce this excess liquidity in future quarters as a result of the recent improvement in the capital markets.   Standby Real Estate Equity Commitments   Periodically, we enter into standby commitments, which obligate us to purchase real estate at a specified cost if a third-party sale does not occur within approximately one year after construction is completed. These commitments are used by a developer to obtain a construction loan from an outside lender on favorable terms. In return for issuing the commitment, we receive an annual fee and a percentage of the profit when the property is sold. Our long-term expectation is that we will be obligated to fund a small portion of these commitments. However, due to the current economic environment, we may experience increased funding obligations.   As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, we had standby real estate equity commitments totaling $214 million and $267 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, we funded commitments of $46 million and the fair value of the associated real estate of $32 million is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which resulted in the recognition of $14 million in realized losses. In addition, we recorded an estimated loss of $20 million in the second quarter of 2009 on one project due to our belief that our requirement to fund the project in accordance with the Standby Contingent Equity Acquisition Program (“CAP”) agreement is probable.   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Makewhole Premiums   Prepayment and makewhole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or makewhole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   The decline in prepayment and makewhole premiums when comparing the six months ended June 30, 2009 to 2008 was attributable primarily to the continued tightening of credit conditions in the market resulting in less refinancing activity and less prepayment income.           137        Realized Loss Related to Investments   The detail of the realized loss related to investments (in millions) was as follows:            For the Three            For the Six              Months Ended            Months Ended              June 30,            June 30,              2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change    Fixed maturity AFS securities:                Gross gains   $ 33     $ 17       94 %   $ 86     $ 25       244 %  Gross losses     (172 )     (125 )     -38 %     (413 )     (220 )     -88 %  Equity AFS securities:                    Gross gains     1       -      NM       4       -      NM    Gross losses     (6 )     (6 )     0 %     (9 )     (6 )     -50 %  Gain on other investments     (58 )     3      NM       (60 )     28      NM    Associated amortization expense of DAC, VOBA,                    DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract                    holder funds and funds withheld                    reinsurance liabilities     48       23       109 %     104       47       121 %  Total realized loss on investments, excluding     (154 )     (88 )     -75 %     (288 )     (126 )    NM    trading securities                    Loss on certain derivative instruments     (4 )     (29 )     86 %     (20 )     (32 )     38 %  Total realized loss on investments and                    certain derivative instruments,                    excluding trading securities   $ (158 )   $ (117 )     -35 %   $ (308 )   $ (158 )     -95 %   Amortization expense of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflects an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental impact of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first six months of 2009 and 2008, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.           138        When the detailed analysis by our credit analysts and investment portfolio managers leads to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.

The $172 million of impairments taken during the first six months of 2009 are split between $168 million of credit related impairments and $4 million on non-credit related impairments. The credit related impairments are largely attributable to our Automotive and Gaming sector holdings, RMBS, and mortgage related ABS holdings that have suffered from continued deterioration in housing fundamentals. Additionally, we wrote down our investment in CIT Group, Inc. by $42 million during the second quarter of 2009. The non-credit related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we have an intent to sell.         139        REINSURANCE   Our insurance companies cede insurance to other companies. The portion of risks exceeding each of our insurance companies’ retention limits is reinsured with other insurers. We seek reinsurance coverage within the businesses that sell life insurance to limit our exposure to mortality losses and enhance our capital management. We utilize inter-company reinsurance agreements to manage our statutory capital position as well as our hedge program for variable annuity guarantees. These inter-company agreements do not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.   Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. As of June 30, 2009, the reserves associated with these reinsurance arrangements totaled $1.0 billion. To cover products other than life insurance, we acquire other insurance coverage with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances. The consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 reflect premiums, benefits and DAC, net of insurance ceded. Our insurance companies remain liable if their reinsurers are unable to meet contractual obligations under applicable reinsurance agreements.   Our amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $7.7 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers, and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers. Swiss Re represents our largest exposure. In 2001, we sold our reinsurance business to Swiss Re primarily through indemnity reinsurance arrangements. Because we are not relieved of our liability to the ceding companies for this business, the liabilities and obligations associated with the reinsured policies remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding reinsurance receivable from the business sold to Swiss Re, which totaled $3.2 billion and $4.5 billion as of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. Swiss Re has funded a trust with a balance of $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2009, to support this business. As a result of Swiss Re’s S&P financial strength rating dropping below AA-, Swiss Re was required to fund additional trusts of approximately $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2009, to support this business. In addition to various remedies that we would have in the event of a default by Swiss Re, we continue to hold assets in support of certain of the transferred reserves. These assets consist of those reported as trading securities and certain mortgage loans. Our liability for funds withheld and our asset for embedded derivatives included $1.2 billion and $27 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2009, related to the business sold to Swiss Re.   We sold a block of disability income business to Swiss Re as part of several indemnity reinsurance transactions executed in 2001, as discussed above. On January 24, 2009, an award of rescission was declared related to an ongoing dispute between us and Swiss Re for this treaty, which requires us to be fully responsible for all claims incurred and liabilities supporting this block as if the reinsurance treaty never existed. See Note 11 for a discussion of the affects of the rescission.   On March 31, 2009, we entered into a 55% coinsurance agreement whereby we ceded a closed block of business consisting of certain UL and VUL insurance products to a third party reinsurer. See “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance” and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” for more information.   From July 2007 until June 2008, we reinsured our Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage rider related to our variable annuities. Swiss Re provided 50% quota share coinsurance of our lifetime GWB, Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, for business written in 2007 and 2008, up to a total of $3.8 billion in deposits.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.           140        REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees, investment advisory fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $447 million and $451 million for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit, a commercial paper program and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases and acquisitions.   The disruptions in the capital markets experienced in the second half of 2008 continued into 2009. During this extraordinary market environment, management continually monitored and adjusted its liquidity and capital plans for LNC and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities. To strengthen the capital position of our principal insurance subsidiaries and provide holding company liquidity during this period of volatility in the capital and credit markets, we issued common stock and debt during the second quarter of 2009 and issued preferred stock and a common stock warrant through the TARP CPP in July of 2009, which is discussed in more detail below in “Financing Activities.”   We believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to the U.S. life insurance sector, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. For more information about ratings, see “Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions – Ratings” above and “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2008 Form 10-K.           141        Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:             For the Three      For the Six      For the        Months Ended      Months Ended      Year Ended        June 30,      June 30,      December 31,        2009      2008      2009      2008      2008    Dividends from Subsidiaries                                LNL, excluding Lincoln Financial Media   $ 403     $ 100     $ 403     $ 300     $ 400    Lincoln Financial Media (1)     4       3       4       653       659    First Penn-Pacific     50       50       50       50       50    Delaware Investments     3       13       5       28       51    Lincoln Barbados     300       -       300       -       -    Lincoln UK     -       24       -       24       24    Other     -       -       -       -       54    Loan Repayments and Interest from                                           Subsidiary                                          LNL interest on intercompany notes (2)     19       19       41       41       83       $ 779     $ 209     $ 803     $ 1,096     $ 1,321    Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                          Net proceeds on common stock issuance   $ 660     $ -     $ 660     $ -     $ -    Net capital received from stock option exercises     -       10       -       13       15       $ 660     $ 10     $ 660     $ 13     $ 15         (1)  For 2008, amount includes proceeds on the sale of certain discontinued media operations.     (2)  Primarily represents interest on the holding company’s $1.3 billion in surplus note investments in LNL.   The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest impact on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.   Dividends from Subsidiaries   Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) up to a certain threshold, or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. As discussed in “Part I – Item 1. Business – Regulatory – Insurance Regulation” in our 2008 Form 10-K, we may not consider the benefit from the permitted practice to the prescribed statutory accounting principles relating to our insurance subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets in calculating available dividends. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.   We expect our domestic insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends of approximately $550 million in 2009 without prior approval from the respective state commissioners. The amount of surplus that our insurance subsidiaries could pay as dividends is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, to provide an additional layer of margin for risk protection and for future investment in our businesses.           142        We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels above current regulatory required levels. As mentioned earlier in “Results of Insurance Solutions – Insurance Solutions – Life Insurance,” more than 67% and 70% of our life sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively, consisted of products containing secondary guarantees, which require reserving practices under AG38. Our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees subject to these statutory reserving requirements.   Included in the letters of credit (“LOCs”) issued as of June 30, 2009, reported in the revolving credit facilities table below in “Financing Activities,” was approximately $1.5 billion of LOCs supporting the reinsurance obligations of LNBAR on UL business with secondary guarantees. Recognizing that LOCs are generally one to five years in duration, it is likely that our insurance companies will apply a mix of LOCs, reinsurance and capital market strategies in addressing long-term AG38 and XXX needs. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the RBC impact of the UL business with secondary guarantee products. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could impact our returns on UL business with secondary guarantee products.   We are continuing to pursue capital management strategies related to our AG38 reserves involving reinsurance and securitizations. As mentioned above in “Reinsurance,” we entered into a coinsurance agreement on March 31, 2009. The transaction resulted in the release of approximately $240 million of statutory capital previously supporting a closed block of business of certain UL and VUL insurance products and an RBC benefit of approximately 20 percentage points in 2009. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2008 Form 10-K for further information on XXX reserves. In addition, a portion of our term life insurance business is reinsured with a domestic reinsurance captive as part of our overall strategy of managing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. There are no outstanding LOCs related to this business.   As a result of recent financing activities discussed below and upon the closing of the TARP CPP, we contributed $1.0 billion to our principal life insurance subsidiary in July 2009. In addition, we contributed media assets to our principal life insurance subsidiary during the second quarter of 2009, which increased our statutory capital by $285 million.   In September of 2008, the NAIC adopted a new statutory reserving standard, VACARVM, which will be effective as of December 31, 2009. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting VACARVM. This reserving requirement will replace current statutory reserving practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits and has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. The actual impact of the adoption will be dependent upon several factors including account values and market conditions that exist as of December 31, 2009, the value of derivative and other assets supporting reserves whose change in value may be uncorrelated with the new reserving requirements and the use of captive or third-party reinsurance. Our current capital plan assumes a $500 million impact related to VACARVM, recognizing that this is a preliminary estimate, and contemplates actions to better manage the capital requirements as we move towards implementation. Markets will greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to their impact on the valuation of reserves and derivative assets hedging these reserves. We continue to evaluate the impact of VACARVM requirements on our capital position and reserving assumptions. Our estimates of the expected impact may change as we conduct further analysis prior to implementation. We are analyzing the current use of existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, and hedging strategies relative to managing the negative impact on the level and volatility of statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. Depending on market conditions, reinsurance solutions and hedging strategies, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower RBC ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries.            143        As a result of the equity market impacts in the second quarter of 2009, we experienced an increase in the statutory reserve adjustment under the Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method (“CARVM”) for our annuity products and lower net reserves for GDB riders. CARVM is the current statutory actuarial method used for determining reserves for the base annuity contract. The impact of these items increased statutory surplus of our statutory insurance companies by approximately $130 million in the second quarter of 2009. We estimate that an S&P level of 800, a 13% drop from the June 30, 2009, level, would result in a decrease in the CARVM statutory reserve adjustment and increase in statutory net GDB reserves, and thereby, reduce statutory surplus of LNL by $75 million to $95 million at the end of the third quarter of 2009. As a result, the estimated RBC ratio on a consolidated basis as of September 30, 2009, under this scenario would be reduced by approximately 10 percentage points. The estimated capital impact is based on the current statutory reserve formulas and does not take into account the reserve and asset adequacy analysis performed by our actuaries on an annual basis to determine appropriateness of the reserves at year end. This analysis incorporates the adequacy of assets in LNBAR, our captive reinsurance company, supporting the liabilities that it assumes from LNL. The outcome of this analysis may result in an additional reserve increase and could further reduce the RBC ratio.    The sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline. The sensitivity will be affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance. Statutory reserves for variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force and therefore result in non-linear relationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period. The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book of business (i.e. the amount of business without guarantees is not subject to the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees). The RBC ratio of LNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries. The market value of our separate account assets increased during the first six months of 2009, resulting in a $53 million increase in statutory surplus. The separate accounts include the impact of our variable annuities and also our credit-linked notes. However, our separate account assets remained less than the guaranteed liabilities that they support as of June 30, 2009. Future declines in the market values of our separate account assets could cause future reductions in the surplus of LNL, which may impact its RBC ratio and dividend capacity.    Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.   On July 10, 2009, we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 950,000 shares of Series B preferred stock together with a related warrant to purchase up to 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.92 per share, in accordance with the terms of the TARP CPP, for an aggregate purchase price of $950 million. Holders of this Series B preferred stock are entitled to a cumulative cash dividend at the annual rate per share of 5% of the liquidation preference, $1,000 per share, or $48 million annually, for the first five years from issuance. After July 10, 2014, if the preferred shares are still outstanding, the annual dividend rate will increase to 9% per year. We intend to repay this financing prior to the increase in the dividend rate, taking into consideration appropriate balance sheet strength and capital market conditions.   On June 22, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of 40 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $15.00 per share, and we also completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.75% senior notes due 2019. On June 25, 2009, we closed on the issuance and sale of 6 million additional shares of our common stock at a price of $15.00 per share to the underwriters who exercised their over-allotment option. The net proceeds from these offerings were approximately $1.1 billion.   As mentioned above, we contributed $1.0 billion of the proceeds of these recent financing activities to our principal insurance subsidiary in July 2009, and we retained the remaining $1.1 billion at the holding company for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term debt and investment in our core businesses.   We announced on June 15, 2009, that we entered into a share purchase agreement to sell Lincoln UK. The transaction is anticipated to close during the fourth quarter of 2009, and we expect that the proceeds of approximately $280 million to $300 million, net of tax, and subject to foreign currency fluctuations, will be used for general corporate purposes.           144        Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:            For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2009                          Change                                Maturities      in Fair                    Beginning            and      Value      Other      Ending        Balance      Issuance      Repayments      Hedges      Changes (1)      Balance    Short-Term Debt                                      Commercial paper   $ 315     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ (112 )   $ 203    Current maturities of long-term debt     500       -       (500 )     -       250       250    Other short-term debt     -       -       -       -       2       2    Total short-term debt   $ 815     $ -     $ (500 )   $ -     $ 140     $ 455                                                      Long-Term Debt                                                  Senior notes   $ 2,555     $ 495     $ -     $ (116 )   $ (249 )   $ 2,685    Bank borrowing     200       -       -       -       -       200    Federal Home Loan Bank                                                  of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance     250       -       -       -       -       250    Junior subordinated debentures                                                  issued to affiliated trusts     155       -       -       -       -       155    Capital securities     1,571       -       (87 )     -       1       1,485    Total long-term debt   $ 4,731     $ 495     $ (87 )   $ (116 )   $ (248 )   $ 4,775         (1)  Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums.   On April 6, 2009, we funded the maturity of a $500 million floating rate senior note through dividends received during the second quarter of 2009 from LNL and LNBAR and internal borrowings. Borrowings that are scheduled to mature within two years include a $250 million floating rate senior note due on March 12, 2010, and a $250 million 6.2% fixed rate senior note due on December 15, 2011. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet the maturities will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of June 30, 2009, the holding company had $495 million in cash and cash equivalents.   In March of 2009, we repurchased $87 million of our capital securities and recognized a gain of $64 million, pre-tax. See Note 10 for additional information on the gain recognized on the early extinguishment of debt.           145        Details underlying our credit facilities with a group of domestic and foreign banks (in millions) were as follows:              As of June 30, 2009      Expiration    Maximum      Borrowings      Date    Available      Outstanding    Revolving Credit Facilities                Credit facility with the FHLBI (1)  Not Applicable   $ 378     $ 350    Five-year revolving credit facility  March 2011     1,750       -    Five-year revolving credit facility  February 2011     1,350       -    Total     $ 3,478     $ 350                        Letters of credit issued             $ 2,095         (1)  Our borrowing capacity under this credit facility does not have an expiration date and continues while our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”) common stock remains outstanding as long as LNL maintains a satisfactory level of creditworthiness and does not incur a material adverse change in its financial, business, regulatory or other areas that would materially affect its operations and viability. Of the borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2009, $250 million is classified within long-term debt and $100 million is classified within payables for collateral under securities loaned and derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maturity dates of the borrowings are discussed below.   The LOCs support inter-company reinsurance transactions and specific treaties associated with our business sold through reinsurance. LOCs are used primarily to satisfy the U.S. regulatory requirements of our domestic insurance companies for which reserve credit is provided by our affiliated offshore reinsurance company, as discussed above, and our domestic clients of the business sold through reinsurance.   Under the credit agreements, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth level. In addition, the agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where we are not the surviving entity and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. All of our credit agreements are unsecured.   If current debt ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively impact overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3. As noted in “Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions – Ratings” above, our long-term debt currently holds a rating of BBB/Baa2. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse impact on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2008 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Ratings” in our 2008 Form 10-K and “Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions – Ratings” above for additional information on our current bond ratings.   In the third quarter of 2008, LNL made an investment of $19 million in the FHLBI, a AAA-rated entity. We are allowed to borrow up to 20 times the amount of our common stock investment in FHLBI. All borrowings from the FHLBI are required to be secured by certain investments owned by LNL. On December 4, 2008, the LNC and LNL Boards of Directors approved an additional common stock investment of $56 million, which would increase our total borrowing capacity up to $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2009, based on our actual common stock investment, we had borrowing capacity of up to approximately $378 million from FHLBI. We had a $250 million floating-rate term loan outstanding under the facility due June 20, 2017, which may be prepaid beginning June 20, 2010. In June 2009, we also borrowed $100 million at a rate of 0.8% that is due June 3, 2010.    Management is monitoring the covenants associated with LNC’s capital securities. If we fail to meet capital adequacy or net income and shareholders’ equity levels (also referred to as “trigger events”), terms in the agreements may be triggered, which would require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”).           146         As a result of our consolidated net loss of $579 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009, and our consolidated net loss of $161 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, we had a trailing four quarter consolidated net loss of $811 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we have triggered the net income test looking forward to the quarters ending September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2009. Also, looking forward to the quarter ending September 30, 2009, we have triggered one of the two shareholders’ equity tests as our adjusted shareholders’ equity as of March 31, 2009, as compared to the benchmark quarter (March 31, 2007) has declined by 10% or more. If our adjusted shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2009, decreases by $455 million or more, then we would also trigger the second shareholders’ equity test, which would trigger the ACSM for at least our interest payments due on November 17, 2009, and January 20, 2010, of approximately $33 million. As a result of our efforts to raise capital in the form of equity during the second quarter of 2009, we did not trigger one of the two shareholders’ equity tests looking forward to the quarter ending December 31, 2009, as our adjusted shareholders’ equity as of June 30, 2009, as compared to the benchmark quarter (June 30, 2007) did not decline by 10% or more.   The ACSM would require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants on our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed. If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient common shares or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. We have designated the proceeds from our June 2009 common stock offering as being available to satisfy the ACSM; therefore, the proceeds can be used for such purpose for 180 days after June 22, 2009.    For more information, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or net income and shareholders’ equity levels” and Note 13 in our 2008 Form 10-K.   Alternative Sources of Liquidity   In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end.   The holding company had an average borrowing balance of $279 million from the cash management program during the second quarter of 2009. The holding company had a maximum and minimum amount of financing that is used from the cash management program during this period of $494 million and $0, respectively. There was no balance as of June 30, 2009. In addition, the holding company had an outstanding receivable of $337 million from certain subsidiaries resulting from funds borrowed by the subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed by those subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account as of June 30, 2009. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of June 30, 2009, our insurance subsidiaries had securities with a carrying value of $437 million out on loan under the securities lending program and $346 million carrying value subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending program is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities.   LNC has a $1.0 billion commercial paper program that is rated A-2, P-2 and F2. The commercial paper program is backed by a bank line of credit. During the second quarter of 2009, LNC had an average of $399 million in commercial paper outstanding with a maximum amount of $704 million outstanding at any time. LNC had $203 million of commercial paper outstanding as of June 30, 2009.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3.         147        Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Stockholders   One of the holding company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our stockholders. Through dividends and stock repurchases, we have an established record of providing significant cash returns to our stockholders. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data) were as follows:            For the Three            For the Six            For the        Months Ended            Months Ended            Year Ended        June 30,            June 30,            December 31,        2009      2008      Change      2009      2008      Change      2008    Dividends to stockholders   $ 3     $ 107       -97 %   $ 56     $ 217       -74 %   $ 429    Repurchase of common stock     -       140       -100 %     -       426       -100 %     476    Total cash returned to                                                          stockholders   $ 3     $ 247       -99 %   $ 56     $ 643       -91 %   $ 905    Number of shares issued     46.000       -      NM       46.000       -      NM       -    Number of shares repurchased     -       2.631       -100 %     -       8.081       -100 %     9.091    Average price per share   $ 14.34     $ 53.13       -73 %   $ 14.34     $ 52.66       -73 %   $ 52.31     Note: Average price per share is calculated using whole dollars instead of dollars rounded to millions.   On February 24, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of the dividend on our common stock from $0.21 to $0.01 per share, which, along with a prior reduction, is expected to add approximately $100 million to capital each quarter. Additionally, we have suspended stock repurchase activity. We expect that both of these changes will favorably impact our capital position prospectively in light of the recent market volatility and extraordinary events and developments affecting financial markets.   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be impacted by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. As a result of the raising of $2.1 billion as part of our capital plan, discussed in “Financing Activities” above, we currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. These actions compliment the previously mentioned dividend reductions, suspension of share repurchases and enterprise-wide restructuring program that is expected to generate $250 million, pre-tax, in annual savings to further strengthen our capital and liquidity positions. In addition, we are exploring our options with regard to protecting and building capital at the insurance company subsidiaries, which may include, depending on then current market conditions and other factors, potential securitizations of reserves, reinsurance transactions and sales of corporate assets. Note, a continuation of or an acceleration of poor capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.           148        OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2008 Form 10-K, as updated in “Part II – Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” in this report.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate, foreign currency exchange, equity market, default, basis and credit. The exposure of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management process, are most important to our Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions businesses, where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management process, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).   Derivatives   We have entered into derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to rapid changes in interest rates. The derivative programs are used to help us achieve somewhat stable margins while providing competitive crediting rates to contract holders during periods when interest rates are changing. Such derivatives include interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate caps and treasury locks. See Note 6 for additional information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   In addition to continuing existing programs, we may use derivative instruments in other strategies to limit risk and enhance returns, particularly in the management of investment spread businesses. We have established policies, guidelines and internal control procedures for the use of derivatives as tools to enhance management of the overall portfolio of risks assumed in our operations. Annually, our Board of Directors reviews our derivatives policy.           149        Impact of Equity Market Sensitivity   Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies as described in “MD&A – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 2 above and in Item 7 of our 2008 Form 10-K, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, as we do not unlock our long-term equity market assumptions based upon short-term fluctuations in the equity markets. However, there is an impact to earnings from the effects of equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related asset-based fees we earn on those assets net of related expenses we incur based upon the level of assets. The following table presents our estimate of the impact on income from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the S&P 500 were to drop to 800 from June 30, 2009, through the next twelve months or dropped to 700 immediately after June 30, 2009, and remain at that level through the next twelve months, excluding any impact related to sales, prospective unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:            S&P 500      S&P 500        at 700 (2)      at 800 (2)    Segment              Retirement Solutions - Annuities (1)   $ (100 )   $ (50 )  Retirement Solutions - Defined Contribution (1)     (10 )     (5 )  Investment Management     (20 )     (10 )       (1)  If the level of the S&P 500 index dropped to 700 immediately after June 30, 2009, and remained at that level in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $260 million to $320 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions early in 2011. If the level of the S&P 500 index remained at the June 30, 2009, level of approximately 800 in subsequent periods we project that we would have a RTM prospective unlocking of approximately $200 million to $240 million, after-tax, for Retirement Solutions early in 2012.     (2)  The baseline for these impacts assumes 9% growth annually beginning with the second quarter of 2009 earnings, when excluding the impacts of retrospective unlocking and federal tax return true-ups. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of S&P 500 at 700 and 800, which assume the index stays at those levels for the next twelve months and grows at 9% annually thereafter. The difference between the baseline and S&P 500 at 700 and 800 scenarios is presented in the table.   The impact on earnings summarized above is an expected effect for the next twelve months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses will not be fully recognized in the current quarter because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values impacts fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the impact on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.   Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders. For additional information see Note 6.           150        Credit Risk    Through the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to both credit risk (our counterparty fails to make payment) and market risk (the value of the instrument falls). When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this generally indicates that the counterparty owes us and, therefore, creates a credit risk for us equal to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, this generally indicates we owe the counterparty and therefore we have no credit risk, but have been affected by market risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with minimum credit ratings that are reviewed regularly by us, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty, and by requiring certain counterparties to post collateral if our credit risk exceeds certain limits. We also maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement. We do not believe that the credit or market risks associated with derivative instruments are material to any insurance subsidiary or to us.   We have derivative positions with counterparties. Assuming zero recovery value, our exposure is the positive market value of the derivative positions with a counterparty, less collateral, that would be lost if the counterparty were to default. As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our counterparty risk exposure, net of collateral, was $325 million and $562 million, respectively. Of this exposure, $99 million and $145 million, respectively was related to our program to hedge our variable annuity guaranteed benefits. As of June 30, 2009, we have exposure to 13 counterparties, with a maximum exposure of $155 million, net of collateral, to a single counterparty. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. For the majority of LNC counterparties, there is a termination event should long-term debt ratings of LNC rating drop below BBB-/Baa3. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring all derivative contracts to be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement.   As of June 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008, our fair value of counterparty exposure (in millions) was as follows:              As of      As of        June 30,      December 31,        2009      2008  Rating              AAA     $ -     $ 20  AA       247       333 A       75       209  BBB       3       -  Total     $ 325     $ 562   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.         151        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings    Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in “Part I – Item 1.”  Item 1A. Risk Factors   The risk factor set forth below updates those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.   Our participation in the TARP CPP subjects us to additional restrictions, oversight and costs, and has other potential consequences, that could materially affect our business, results and prospects.   On July 10, 2009, in connection with the TARP CPP, we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 950,000 shares of Series B preferred stock together with a related warrant to purchase up to 13,049,451 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.92 per share, in accordance with the terms of the TARP CPP, for an aggregate purchase price of $950 million. Access to TARP CPP was an important component of our strategy to enhance our capital position and financial flexibility. We believe that the amount of our participation in the TARP CPP offers us the ability to exit the program, if necessary, to manage the potential material consequences to our businesses from the potential restrictions, oversight and costs of participation, which include the following:        ·  Our acceptance of the TARP CPP funds could cause us to be perceived as having greater capital needs and weaker overall financial prospects than those of our competitors that have stated that they are not participating in the TARP CPP, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results, including new product sales and policy retention rates, and depress trading prices for our common stock;     ·  Receipt of the TARP CPP funds subjects us to restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock. For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and recently promulgated regulations thereunder contain significant limitations on the amount and form of bonus, retention and other incentive compensation that participants in the TARP CPP may pay to executive officers and senior management. These provisions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel. Other regulatory initiatives applicable to participants in federal funding programs may also be forthcoming as the U.S. government continues to address dislocations in the financial markets. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner;     ·  Future federal statutes may adversely affect the terms of the TARP CPP that are applicable to us and the Treasury Department may amend the terms of our agreement with them unilaterally if required by future statutes, including in a manner materially adverse to us;          152              ·  Our participation in the TARP CPP imposes additional restrictions on our ability to increase our common stock dividend. In particular, we would need to obtain the U.S. Treasury’s consent for any increase in our current quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share of our common stock, as well as any stock repurchase, until the third anniversary of such investment unless, prior to such third anniversary, we redeem all of the shares of Series B preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury or the U.S. Treasury transfers such preferred stock to third parties. We are also unable to repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock or any series of preferred stock outstanding unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the Series B preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury are fully paid; and     ·  If we do not repurchase the warrant from the U.S. Treasury when we repay the investment, the U.S. Treasury will liquidate the warrant, which will dilute the ownership interest of our existing holders of common stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
