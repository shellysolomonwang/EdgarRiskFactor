Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2015. For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business activities, see the risks described in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K as updated by “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” below.       In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2014 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.       Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.        FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE       Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.        Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:          ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, our ability to conduct business and our captive reinsurance arrangements as well as restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b‑1 payments; and the potential for U.S. federal tax reform;    ·    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;     ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) on us and the economy and financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    40          ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and    ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.        Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.        INTRODUCTION       Executive Summary        We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.       We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2014 Form 10-K.        For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.       Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2014 Form 10-K.        For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.           41          Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The MD&A included in our 2014 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2014 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K.       DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL       Unlocking       As stated in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Unlocking” in our 2014 Form 10-K, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products in the third quarter of each year.  The profitability of our business depends, among other things, on assumptions regarding variable fund returns, investment margins, lapse rates and mortality.        Interest rate fluctuations or prolonged low rates could negatively affect our profitability from interest rate spread businesses and thereby reduce future EGPs. Investment margins are driven by interest rate spreads, or the difference between the interest that we are required to credit to contracts and the yields that we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting our obligations under the contracts. Accordingly, the assumption of the yield that can be earned on new money is critical to the unlocking analysis.          Although interest rates are expected to move higher some time in the future, new money rates continue to be at historically low levels and as a result, require careful analysis when forecasting the future direction of changes in rates. If we change our view of future new money rates and lower our current long-term yield assumption, then, assuming that all other assumptions remain constant, we estimate the impact of lowering this assumption by 50 basis points would be approximately $(125) million to income (loss) from operations due primarily to unlocking our DAC and VOBA assets.  This impact would be most pronounced in our Life Insurance segment. The actual impact of a 50 basis point decline in the yield would be based upon a number of factors existing at the time of the assumption-update, and therefore, the actual amount of the loss may differ from our current estimate. In addition, lower investment margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Reversion to the Mean       As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process, as discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K.        Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate drop of approximately 12% followed by growth going forward of 7% to 9% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed-income and equity-type investments. If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of March 31, 2015, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $295 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $35 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.           42          Investments       Investment Valuation        The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of March 31, 2015:                                                                                                                                                             Quoted                                                           Prices                                                           in Active                                                           Markets for    Significant    Significant                           Identical    Observable    Unobservable                           Assets    Inputs    Inputs        Total               (Level 1)    (Level 2)    (Level 3)        Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  691 				           $  75,994 				           $     -            $  76,685 				         Priced by independent broker quotations             -                 -              2,247 				             2,247 				         Priced by matrices             -              13,426 				                -              13,426 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              1,498 				             1,498 				         Total        $  691 				           $  89,420 				           $  3,745 				           $  93,856 				                                                                                Percent of total          1% 				             95% 				             4% 				             100% 				              (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.           For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2014 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.       As of March 31, 2015, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2015, we used broker quotes for 80 securities as our final price source, representing approximately 1% of total securities owned.        Derivatives        Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Guaranteed Living Benefits       Within our individual annuity business, approximately 70% of our variable annuity account values contained guaranteed living benefits (“GLB”) features as of March 31, 2015. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features, leading to an increase in our existing liability or a decline if in an asset position for those benefits. For example, a contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, 3% and 4%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, was $254 million and $307 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.       For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.        For information on our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income, which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities, see our discussion in “Part II – Item 7.

(2)    See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.    (3)    Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 to 2014       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values as a result of increasing equity markets and positive net flows.        The increase in income from operations was partially offset primarily by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher account values, resulting in higher trail commissions. This increase was partially offset by higher average equity markets than our model projections assumed, resulting in a lower amortization rate.       We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values.        Additional Information       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we increased our variable annuity deposits on products without GLB riders to 27%, compared to 19% for the corresponding period in 2014.        The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 7% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.        Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed      45       accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2014 Form 10-K.

We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and variable fund returns. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Fee income includes charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but excludes the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” in our 2014 Form 10-K for discussion of these attributed fees.           46          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited       Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Net Investment Income                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                      on real estate and other, net of                                      investment expenses    $  206 				       $  216 				       -5%          Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                      bond make-whole premiums (1)      10 				         4 				     150% 				         Surplus investments (2)      31 				         39 				       -21%          Total net investment income    $  247 				       $  259 				       -5%                                                 Interest Credited                                      Amount provided to contract holders    $  139 				       $  146 				       -5%          DSI deferrals      (5 				   )      (2 				   )    NM          Interest credited before DSI amortization      134 				         144 				       -7%          DSI amortization      9 				         10 				       -10%          Total interest credited    $  143 				       $  154 				       -7%               (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.       Benefits       Benefits for this segment include changes in income annuity reserves driven by premiums, changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking on benefit reserves associated with our guaranteed death benefit riders.           48          Commissions and Other Expenses        Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Commissions and Other Expenses                                      Commissions:                                      Deferrable    $  129 				       $  146 				       -12%          Non-deferrable      120 				         104 				     15% 				         General and administrative expenses      103 				         105 				       -2%          Inter-segment reimbursement associated                                       with reserve financing and                                      LOC expenses (1)      2 				         1 				     100% 				         Taxes, licenses and fees      11 				         13 				       -15%          Total expenses incurred, excluding                                      broker-dealer      365 				         369 				       -1%          DAC deferrals      (147 				   )      (165 				   )  11% 				         Total pre-broker-dealer expenses                                      incurred, excluding amortization,                                      net of interest      218 				         204 				     7% 				         DAC and VOBA amortization,                                      net of interest      100 				         100 				     0% 				         Broker-dealer expenses incurred      106 				         98 				     8% 				         Total commissions and other                                      expenses    $  424 				       $  402 				     5% 				                                                DAC Deferrals                                      As a percentage of sales/deposits      4.9% 				         4.9% 				                      (1)    Includes reimbursements to Annuities from the Life Insurance segment for reserve financing, net of expenses incurred by Annuities for its use of letters of credit (“LOCs”). The inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).      Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain types of commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.       Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues.           49          RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                        Months Ended                        March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Operating Revenues                                      Fee income    $  62 				       $  61 				     2% 				         Net investment income      208 				         207 				     0% 				         Other revenues (1)      3 				         3 				     0% 				         Total operating revenues      273 				         271 				     1% 				         Operating Expenses                                      Interest credited      123 				         118 				     4% 				         Commissions and other expenses      102 				         100 				     2% 				         Total operating expenses      225 				         218 				     3% 				         Income (loss) from operations before taxes      48 				         53 				       -9%          Federal income tax expense (benefit)      13 				         14 				       -7%          Income (loss) from operations    $  35 				       $  39 				       -10%               (1)    Consists primarily of mutual fund account program revenues for mid to large employers.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 to 2014       Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by spread compression as a result of new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields and less favorable investment income on alternative investments within our surplus portfolio.        The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by higher average fixed account values.       We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        See the Fixed Account Value Information table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.       Additional Information       We expect to continue making strategic investments during 2015 to improve our infrastructure and expand distribution that will result in higher expenses.        Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year.       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2015, compared to 16% for the corresponding period in 2014.        Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our highest margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of their surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 31% and 33% as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.       Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may      50       cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2014 Form 10-K.

Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

(2)    See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 to 2014       Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to fluctuations in mortality from higher death claims and increased retention including the recapture of reinsured business in the fourth quarter of 2014.        The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by higher fee income attributable to growth in business in force.       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Additional Information” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information on the recapture.        We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain       Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk-based capital (“RBC”) levels above current regulatory required levels. Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”). During the third quarter of 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) announced that it would not recognize the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) revisions to AG38 in applying the New York law governing the reserves to be held for UL and VUL products containing secondary guarantees. The change, which was effective as of December 31, 2013, impacts our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”). LLANY discontinued the sale of these products in early 2013, but the change affects those policies sold prior to that time. We began phasing in the increase in reserves over five years beginning in 2013. As of March 31, 2015, we have increased reserves by $180 million. The additional increase in reserves is subject to ongoing discussions with the NYDFS. However, we do not expect the amount for each of the remaining years to exceed $90 million per year. We do not expect the total reserve increase to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For more discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased XXX and AG38 statutory reserves associated with term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2014 Form 10-K and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Subsidiaries Statutory Reserving and Surplus” herein.       Our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by using long-dated LOCs as well as other financing transactions. Included in the LOCs issued as of March 31, 2015, were $3.3 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-     56       company reinsurance arrangements. Approximately $2.3 billion of such LOCs were issued for UL products containing secondary guarantees ($350 million will expire in 2019, and $1.9 billion will expire in 2031), and $1.0 billion of such LOCs that will expire in 2023 were issued for term business solutions. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. An inability to obtain appropriate capital market solutions could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2014 Form 10-K for further information on XXX and AG38 reserves. See the table in “Commissions and Other Expenses” below for the presentation of our expenses associated with reserve financing.        Additional Information       We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.        For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Insurance Premiums       Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.

Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.        Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.        Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:         ·    MoneyGuard®, our linked-benefit product – 15% of total expected premium deposits;    ·    Single premium bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) – 15% of single premium deposits;    ·    UL, VUL, and corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and    ·    Term – 100% of annualized first year premiums.      Changes in the marketplace and continuing efforts to increase sales of higher return products in a low interest rate environment have resulted in a shift in our business mix.            58          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited       Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Net Investment Income                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                      on real estate and other, net of                                      investment expenses    $  570 				       $  564 				     1% 				         Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and                                      bond make-whole premiums (1)      19 				         6 				     217% 				         Alternative investments (2)      5 				         16 				       -69%          Surplus investments (3)      32 				         38 				       -16%          Total net investment income    $  626 				       $  624 				     0% 				                                                Interest Credited    $  338 				       $  334 				     1% 				              (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements.  These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves. These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL. Generally, we have higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.

For our traditional products, DAC and VOBA are amortized on either a straight-line basis or as a level percent of premium of the related contracts, depending on the block of business. When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, to the corresponding period in 2014, the decrease was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with lower commission rates.           61          RESULTS OF GROUP PROTECTION       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                 For the Three                        Months Ended                        March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Operating Revenues                                      Insurance premiums    $  561 				       $  562 				     0% 				         Net investment income      43 				         45 				       -4%          Other revenues      1 				         3 				       -67%          Total operating revenues      605 				         610 				       -1%          Operating Expenses                                      Interest credited      1 				         1 				     0% 				         Benefits      440 				         423 				     4% 				         Commissions and other expenses      174 				         156 				     12% 				         Total operating expenses      615 				         580 				     6% 				         Income (loss) from operations before taxes      (10 				   )      30 				       NM          Federal income tax expense (benefit)      (4 				   )      10 				       NM          Income (loss) from operations    $  (6 				   )    $  20 				       NM                                                                                                           For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Income (Loss) from Operations by                                      Product Line                                      Life    $  (3 				   )    $  5 				       NM          Disability      (4 				   )      13 				       NM          Dental         -          1 				       -100%          Total non-medical      (7 				   )      19 				       NM          Medical      1 				         1 				     0% 				         Income (loss) from operations    $  (6 				   )    $  20 				       NM             Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 to 2014       Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:         ·    Unfavorable total non-medical loss ratio experience attributable to increased long-term disability incidence, a decline in long-term disability recoveries, and unfavorable mortality and life waiver experience.     ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher amortization of DAC driven by higher lapses and re-pricing actions primarily on our employer-paid life and disability business.       We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.       Additional Information       Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. For every one percent increase in the loss ratio, we would expect an approximate annual $13 million to $15 million decrease to income from operations. During the first quarter of 2015, our total non-medical loss ratio of 78.1% was above our long-term expectation of 71% to 74%. We expect the loss ratios to be above the high end of our target range during 2015.        Although not expected to be as high as the current quarter, we expect higher amortization of DAC to continue during 2015 as compared to 2014 due to increased lapses and re-pricing actions.       For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”       62           For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.        Insurance Premiums       Details underlying insurance premiums (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                     For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Insurance Premiums by Product Line                                      Life    $  230 				       $  237 				       -3%          Disability      247 				         239 				     3% 				         Dental      58 				         57 				     2% 				         Total non-medical      535 				         533 				     0% 				         Medical      26 				         29 				       -10%          Total insurance premiums    $  561 				       $  562 				     0% 				                                                Sales    $  56 				       $  64 				       -13%             Our cost of insurance and policy administration charges are embedded in the premiums charged to our customers. The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.        Sales relate to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products. When comparing sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015, to the corresponding period in 2014, the decrease was partly the result of re-pricing actions primarily on our employer-paid life and disability business. We continue to shift the business mix to employee-paid blocks of business, which we expect will improve the overall profitability of the business.        Net Investment Income       We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.

Certain broker commissions that vary with and are related to paid premiums are expensed as incurred. The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.

The decrease was partially offset by lower net investment income, net of interest credited, related to lower average invested assets driven by repurchases of common stock and lower distributable earnings received from our business segments.       64       We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.       Additional Information       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.        Net Investment Income and Interest Credited        We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.       Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the business segments and Other Operations.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life & Health America, Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.       Benefits       Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.

(2)    Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its use of LOCs.       Interest and Debt Expense       Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.        For information on our counterparty exposure, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”        Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 to 2014        We had higher realized losses during 2015 as compared to 2014 driven primarily by the following components of excluded realized gain (loss), which we have described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax:         ·    Higher losses on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2015 attributable to more volatile capital markets resulting in more unfavorable hedge program performance during 2015.    ·    An increase in OTTI attributable to individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings.       The higher realized losses were partially offset by gains on the mark-to-market on certain instruments during 2015 as compared to losses during 2014 attributable primarily to gains on derivative investments (not including those associated with our variable annuity net derivatives results).

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification       Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.        We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.        68          Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios       Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.

Refer to “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios – Trading Securities” in our 2014 Form 10-K for further details.       AFS Securities       In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other      70       contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the    amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.        The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                         Rating Agency        As of March 31, 2015        As of December 31, 2014          NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of          Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total                                                                                             Investment Grade Securities                                                                          1        Aaa / Aa / A        $  44,221 				       $  50,209 				     56.1% 				       $  43,285 				       $  48,753 				     56.2% 				         2        Baa          32,481 				         35,119 				     39.3% 				         31,987 				         34,229 				     39.4% 				         Total investment grade securities          76,702 				         85,328 				     95.4% 				         75,272 				         82,982 				     95.6% 				                                                                                            Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                          3        Ba          3,004 				         3,053 				     3.4% 				         2,858 				         2,884 				     3.3% 				         4        B          786 				         760 				     0.9% 				         821 				         766 				     0.9% 				         5        Caa and lower          307 				         253 				     0.3% 				         224 				         189 				     0.2% 				         6        In or near default          19 				         17 				     0.0% 				         21 				         17 				     0.0% 				         Total below investment grade securities          4,116 				         4,083 				     4.6% 				         3,924 				         3,856 				     4.4% 				         Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  80,818 				       $  89,411 				     100.0% 				       $  79,196 				       $  86,838 				     100.0% 				                                                                                            Total securities below investment                                                                          grade as a percentage of total                                                                          fixed maturity AFS securities          5.1% 				         4.6% 				                 5.0% 				         4.4% 				                      (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the NAIC or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of March 31, 2015.       Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by Fitch and S&P) by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).        As of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, 81.1% and 86.9%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on AFS securities as of March 31, 2015, decreased by $84 million. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2014 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2015, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.            71          Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) as of March 31, 2015, was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 Gross         Estimated        Estimated                                               Unrealized        Years        Average                                               Losses        Until Call        Years                                   Fair        and        or         Until        Subordination Level               Value        OTTI        Maturity        Recovery        Current        Origination      CMBS    $  13 				       $  9 				       2 to 32        29        4.3%            25.7%          Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities      188 				         38 				       1 to 53        23        N/A            N/A             As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2014 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.        The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.       We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:         ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.      To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:         ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.       As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $109.5 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $90.5 billion as of March 31, 2015. If it were necessary to liquidate investments prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $81.0 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $598 million, as of March 31, 2015, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.        See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2014 Form 10-K and Note 4 for additional discussion.       As of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $14.7 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively, representing 14% of total invested assets.           72       For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 3 in this report and Note 4 in our 2014 Form 10-K.        Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2014 Form 10-K for a discussion of our MBS.        Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $5.0 billion and an unrealized gain of $277 million, or 6%, as of March 31, 2015.            73          The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $508 million and represented approximately 0.5% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2015.  AFS securities represented $497 million, or 98%, and trading securities represented $11 million, or 2%, of the subprime exposure as of March 31, 2015. The table below summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of residential mortgages (in millions) as of March 31, 2015:                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Subprime/                                       Agency        Prime        Alt-A        Option ARM (1)        Total                                                              Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized    Fair    Amortized           Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost          Type                                                                                                                              RMBS    $  2,881 				       $  2,642 				       $  487 				       $  466 				       $  413 				       $  408 				       $  391 				       $  394 				       $  4,172 				       $  3,910 				         ABS home equity      3 				         3 				            -

The $146 million in trading securities consisted of $128 million prime, $7 million Alt-A and $11 million subprime.

The $136 million in trading securities consisted of $118 million prime, $7 million Alt-A and $11 million subprime.     (4)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.       None of these investments included any direct investments in subprime lenders or mortgages. We are not aware of material exposure to subprime loans in our alternative asset portfolio.           74          The following summarizes our investments in AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages (in millions) as of March 31, 2015:                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Multiple Property        Single Property        CRE CDOs        Total               Fair        Amortized        Fair        Amortized        Fair        Amortized        Fair        Amortized               Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost        Value        Cost          Type                                                                                                       CMBS    $  487 				       $  473 				       $  15 				       $  12 				       $     -        $     -        $  502 				       $  485 				         CRE CDOs         -             -             -             -          18 				         16 				         18 				         16 				         Total by type (1)(2)    $  487 				       $  473 				       $  15 				       $  12 				       $  18 				       $  16 				       $  520 				       $  501 				                                                                                                                Rating                                                                                                      AAA    $  287 				       $  277 				       $     -        $     -        $     -        $     -        $  287 				       $  277 				         AA      28 				         27 				            -             -             -             -          28 				         27 				         A      86 				         80 				         15 				         12 				            -             -          101 				         92 				         BBB      33 				         32 				            -             -          5 				         5 				         38 				         37 				         BB and below      53 				         57 				            -             -          13 				         11 				         66 				         68 				         Total by rating (1)(2)(3)    $  487 				       $  473 				       $  15 				       $  12 				       $  18 				       $  16 				       $  520 				       $  501 				                                                                                                                Origination Year                                                                                                      2004 and prior    $  33 				       $  32 				       $     -        $     -        $     -        $     -        $  33 				       $  32 				         2005      119 				         123 				         15 				         12 				         5 				         5 				         139 				         140 				         2006      99 				         95 				            -             -          13 				         11 				         112 				         106 				         2007      52 				         45 				            -             -             -             -          52 				         45 				         2010      59 				         54 				            -             -             -             -          59 				         54 				         2012      7 				         7 				                                                         7 				         7 				         2013      118 				         117 				            -             -             -             -          118 				         117 				         Total by origination                                                                                                       year (1)(2)    $  487 				       $  473 				       $  15 				       $  12 				       $  18 				       $  16 				       $  520 				       $  501 				                                                                                                                Total AFS securities backed by pools of commercial mortgages as a percentage of total AFS securities      0.6% 				         0.6% 				              (1)    Does not include the fair value of trading securities totaling $4 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $4 million in trading securities consisted entirely of CMBS.     (2)    Does not include the amortized cost of trading securities totaling $4 million, which support our Modco reinsurance agreements because investment results for these agreements are passed directly to the reinsurers. The $4 million in trading securities consisted entirely of CMBS.     (3)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the major credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.       As of March 31, 2015, the amortized cost and fair value of our AFS exposure to Monoline insurers was $485 million and $540 million, respectively.        Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities       When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of securities in an unrealized loss position on our future earnings.            75       The composition by industry categories of all securities in unrealized loss position (in millions) as of March 31, 2015, was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                         %                                                       Gross        Gross                           %                    %        Unrealized        Unrealized               Fair        Fair        Amortized        Amortized        Losses        Losses               Value        Value        Cost        Cost        and OTTI        and OTTI          Oil field services    $  789 				     9.8% 				       $  875 				     10.3% 				       $  86 				     17.6% 				         Metals and mining      656 				     8.2% 				         718 				     8.4% 				         62 				     12.6% 				         Banking      422 				     5.3% 				         483 				     5.7% 				         61 				     12.5% 				         Independent      1,008 				     12.6% 				         1,065 				     12.5% 				         57 				     11.6% 				         Home equity      343 				     4.3% 				         378 				     4.4% 				         35 				     7.2% 				         CMOs      759 				     9.5% 				         780 				     9.2% 				         21 				     4.3% 				         Retailers      79 				     1.0% 				         100 				     1.2% 				         21 				     4.3% 				         Property and casualty      139 				     1.7% 				         154 				     1.8% 				         15 				     3.1% 				         Midstream      348 				     4.3% 				         360 				     4.2% 				         12 				     2.5% 				         Integrated      211 				     2.6% 				         222 				     2.6% 				         11 				     2.2% 				         Industries with unrealized losses                                                                  less than $10 million      3,274 				     40.7% 				         3,382 				     39.7% 				         108 				     22.1% 				         Total by industry    $  8,028 				     100.0% 				       $  8,517 				     100.0% 				       $  489 				     100.0% 				                                                                            Total by industry as a percentage                                                                  of total AFS securities      9.0% 				                 10.5% 				                 100.0% 				                    As of March 31, 2015, the amortized cost and fair value of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss position was $341 million and $248 million, respectively.

As of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, alternative investments included investments in 171 and 156 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented approximately 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and do not significantly impact our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.       Non-Income Producing Investments       As of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $8 million.        Net Investment Income       Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:                                                                                     For the Three                   Months Ended                   March 31,                   2015        2014              Fixed maturity AFS securities    $  1,015 				       $  1,011 				             Equity AFS securities         -          2 				             Trading securities      28 				         33 				             Mortgage loans on real estate      95 				         95 				             Real estate      1 				         3 				             Policy loans      37 				         39 				             Invested cash      1 				         1 				             Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                   and bond make-whole premiums (1)      37 				         16 				             Alternative investments (2)      8 				         44 				             Other investments         -          (6 				   )          Investment income      1,222 				         1,238 				             Investment expense      (35 				   )      (30 				   )          Net investment income    $  1,187 				       $  1,208 				                  (1)    See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.       Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums       Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.       Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments       Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                     For the Three                   Months Ended                   March 31,                   2015        2014              Fixed maturity AFS securities: (1)                                  Gross gains    $  2 				       $  8 				             Gross losses      (16 				   )      (6 				   )          Equity AFS securities:                                  Gross gains         -             -              Gross losses         -             -              Gain (loss) on other investments      (7 				   )         -              Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                  DSI and DFEL and changes in                                   other contract holder funds      (6 				   )      (7 				   )          Total realized gain (loss) related to                                   certain investments, pre-tax    $  (27 				   )    $  (5 				   )                   (1)    These amounts are represented net of related fair value hedging activity. See Note 5 for more information.      Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized losses reflecting the incremental effect of actual      79       versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gain (loss). The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest rate-related impairments.       Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2015 and 2014, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.        We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.       When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Write-downs for OTTI and Allowance for Losses” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.       Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          OTTI Recognized in Net Income (Loss)                                      Fixed maturity securities:                                      Corporate bonds    $  (11 				   )    $     -        NM          ABS      (2 				   )      (3 				   )  33% 				         RMBS      (2 				   )      (2 				   )  0% 				         Gross OTTI recognized in net                                       income (loss)      (15 				   )      (5 				   )    NM          Associated amortization of DAC,                                      VOBA, DSI and DFEL      2 				         2 				     0% 				         Net OTTI recognized in net income                                       (loss), pre-tax    $  (13 				   )    $  (3 				   )    NM                                                 Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                                       Gross OTTI recognized in OCI    $  9 				       $  7 				     29% 				         Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL      (2 				   )         -        NM          Net portion of OTTI recognized in OCI,                                      pre-tax    $  7 				       $  7 				     0% 				            The increase in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first three months of 2015 to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily attributable to individual credit risks within our corporate bond holdings.        The $24 million of impairments taken during the first three months of 2015 was split between $15 million of credit-related impairments and $9 million of noncredit-related impairments. The noncredit-related impairments were due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.        REINSURANCE       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Reinsurance” in our 2014 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion regarding our counterparty risk with our reinsurers, including collateral securing our reinsurance recoverable, which information is incorporated herein by reference. For more information about reinsurance, see Note 9 in our 2014 Form 10-K.            80       REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow           Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $296 million and $263 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.        The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decline (or increase). During the three months ended March 31, 2015, our payables for collateral on derivative investments increased by $378 million due primarily to falling interest rates that increased the fair values of our associated derivative investments. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to post collateral with a counterparty if our net derivative liability position reaches certain contractual levels. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash and invested cash to provide as collateral, we have multiple liquidity sources to leverage that would be eligible for collateral posting. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 5.       Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Dividends from Subsidiaries                                      The Lincoln National Life Insurance                                      Company    $  400 				       $  150 				     167% 				                                                Loan Repayments and Interest from                                       Subsidiaries                                      Interest on inter-company notes      29 				         34 				       -15%               $  429 				       $  184 				     133% 				         Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                      Net capital received from (paid for taxes on)                                      stock option exercises and restricted stock    $  10 				       $  (6 				   )  267% 				            The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company. For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Dividends from Subsidiaries” in our 2014 Form 10-K.        Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus       Like other life insurers, we utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements with captives primarily to manage risk and statutory capital. Captive reinsurers are typically special purpose vehicles that either by statute or by restriction in their licensing orders are limited to reinsuring business from insurance affiliates. Specifically, captives help us mitigate the capital impact of XXX and AG38 reserving guidelines. XXX and AG38 require insurers to use reserving assumptions that result in statutory reserves greater than what we expect to need to adequately support term life insurance policies and UL policies with secondary guarantees. The captive reinsurance structures we use provide a mechanism for the financing of a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner. This, in turn, frees up capital that the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including for paying dividends to the holding company. Once      81       transferred to the holding company, it can deploy this capital for a variety of corporate purposes, including potentially for stock repurchases.       Currently, insurance companies are using a wide variety of captive reinsurance structures to support their respective businesses. The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been studying the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model laws and regulations applicable to life and annuity captives. Recently, the NAIC adopted Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG48”) that regulates the terms of captive reinsurance arrangements that are entered into or amended in certain ways after December 31, 2014. AG48 imposes restrictions on the types of assets that can be used to support these arrangements. We believe that we will be able to implement these arrangements in compliance with the new requirements.       For more discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased XXX and AG38 statutory reserves associated with term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”       Financing Activities       Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.        We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares.        Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                     For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015                                       Maturities,        Change                                                                       Repayments        in Fair                                           Beginning                         and         Value            Other            Ending           Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt (2)    $  250 				       $     -            $     -            $     -            $     -            $  250 				                                                                                                Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,558 				       $  300 				           $     -            $  56 				           $  1 				           $  3,915 				     Bank borrowing       250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                                                                          Indianapolis advance      250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Capital securities      1,212 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,212 				     Total long-term debt    $  5,270 				       $  300 				           $     -            $  56 				           $  1 				           $  5,627 				          (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.    (2)    As of March 31, 2015, consisted of a $250 million 4.30% fixed-rate senior note maturing on June 15, 2015.      On March 9, 2015, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.35% senior notes due 2025. We expect to use the proceeds from this offering to repay the maturity mentioned in the table above and for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2015, the holding company had available liquidity of $786 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.        For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2014 Form 10-K.       We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales and do not have any other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.       If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of March 31, 2015. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit      82       and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2014 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2014 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.       Alternative Sources of Liquidity       In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of March 31, 2015, the holding company had a net outstanding payable of $19 million to certain subsidiaries resulting from loans made by the subsidiaries in excess of amounts borrowed by those subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.       Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2015, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $3.0 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Divestitures       For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Uses of Capital       Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.        Return of Capital to Common Stockholders        One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.       Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Common dividends to stockholders    $  51 				       $  42 				     21% 				         Repurchase of common stock      350 				         150 				     133% 				         Total cash returned to stockholders    $  401 				       $  192 				     109% 				                                                Number of shares repurchased      6.043 				         2.988 				     102% 				         Average price per share    $  57.94 				       $  50.22 				     15% 				                83       On October 29, 2014, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.16 to $0.20 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2015 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.       Other Uses of Capital       In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       March 31,                       2015        2014        Change          Debt service (interest paid)    $  59 				       $  68 				       -13%          Capital contribution to subsidiaries      75 				            -        NM          Total    $  134 				       $  68 				     97% 				            The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.       Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow       As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K.        OTHER MATTERS       Other Factors Affecting Our Business       In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).           84       Interest Rate Risk         Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity       For information about the effect of interest rate sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses        In periods of low interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.        Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.       The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the March 31, 2015, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the first quarter of 2015 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:                                                                                                                                                                         Account Values                           Retirement                                %                                Plan            Life                         Account               Annuities            Services        Insurance (1)        Total        Values          Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                                          Discretionary rate setting products: (2)                                                                          Occurring within the next twelve months: (3)                                                                          No difference    $  8,406 				           $  10,586 				           $  31,763 				           $  50,755 				     71.3% 				         Up to 0.50%      1,637 				             443 				             458 				             2,538 				     3.6% 				         0.51% to 1.00%      1,247 				             128 				             17 				             1,392 				     2.0% 				         1.01% to 1.50%      1,254 				             15 				             118 				             1,387 				     1.9% 				         1.51% to 2.00%      781 				                -              570 				             1,351 				     1.9% 				         2.01% to 2.50%      748 				                -                 -              748 				     1.1% 				         2.51% to 3.00%      122 				                -                 -              122 				     0.2% 				         3.01% or greater      27 				                -                 -              27 				     0.0% 				         Occurring after the next twelve months (4)      5,436 				                -                 -              5,436 				     7.6% 				         Total discretionary rate setting products       19,658 				             11,172 				             32,926 				             63,756 				     89.6% 				         Other contracts (5)      2,295 				             5,116 				                -              7,411 				     10.4% 				         Total account values    $  21,953 				           $  16,288 				           $  32,926 				           $  71,167 				     100.0% 				                                                                                    Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                                          values at minimum guaranteed rates      42.8% 				             94.8% 				             96.5% 				             79.6% 				                      (1)    Excludes policy loans.    (2)    Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.    (3)    The average crediting rates were 45 basis points, 2 basis points and 4 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.    (4)    The average crediting rates were 108 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Of our account values for these products: 30% are scheduled to reset in more than one year but not more than two years; 23% are scheduled to reset in more than two years but not more than three years; and 47% are scheduled to reset in more than three years.     (5)    For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to income annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates primarily to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 9 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates and 81% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.      The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.           85       Derivatives       See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.       Equity Market Risk       Our revenues, assets and liabilities are exposed to equity market risk that we often hedge with derivatives. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2014 Form 10-K for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.        Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity       For information about the effect of equity market sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity” in our 2014 Form 10-K.       Credit Risk       We may use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events, and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors.        In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:                                                              As of        As of               March 31,    December 31,                   2015            2014              AA        $  10 				           $  17 				             A          20 				             19 				             BBB          5 				             5 				             Total         $  35 				           $  41 				                See Note 5 for additional information on our credit risk.        Item 4. Controls and Procedures       Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.       Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.                86       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1. Legal Proceedings       Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 8 in “Part I – Item 1.”       Item 1A. Risk Factors       Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability.       State Regulation       Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of supervision and regulation covers, among other things:         ·    Standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency, including RBC measurements;    ·    Restrictions on certain transactions, including, but not limited to, reinsurance between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates;    ·    Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;    ·    Restrictions on the receipt of reinsurance credit;    ·    Restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations;    ·    Limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay;    ·    Licensing status of the company;    ·    Certain required methods of accounting pursuant to statutory accounting principles;    ·    Reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and    ·    Assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.      State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the NAIC could enact additional regulations related to the reinsurance of variable annuity business that could limit or even eliminate our ability to reinsure such business in the future.       Although we endeavor to maintain all required licenses and approvals our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company. As of March 31, 2015, no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any material fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.       Federal Regulation       In addition, our broker-dealer and investment advisor subsidiaries as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products, are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulation Authority. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. The foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies, as well as the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) and others, have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations, regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.       On April 14, 2015, the DOL re-proposed a regulation that would, if finalized in current form, substantially expand the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal      87       Revenue Code. If finalized as proposed, the investment-related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to plan sponsors, participants and IRA holders on a non-fiduciary basis could be substantially limited beyond what is allowed under current law. This could change the methods that we use to deliver services.        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
