Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2013.   In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.   Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods’ financial information.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE   Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.   Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:       ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;        ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;        ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;        ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements related to secondary guarantee universal life and annuities; regulations regarding captive reinsurance arrangements; restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b-1 payments; and the potential for U.S. federal tax reform;        ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;           40               ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on us and the economy and the financial services sector in particular;        ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;        ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;        ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;        ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;        ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;        ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;        ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;        ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;        ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;        ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems;        ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;        ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;        ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;        ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;        ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and        ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.   INTRODUCTION   Executive Summary   We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit universal life, term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.        41            We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2012 Form 10-K.   For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.   Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2012 Form 10-K.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The MD&A included in our 2012 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2012 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K.   DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL   Reversion to the Mean (“RTM”)   As equity markets do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our RTM process, as discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate drop of approximately 14% followed by growth going forward of 8% to 9% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed income and equity-type investments. If we were to have unlocked our RTM assumption in the corridor as of March 31, 2013, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $260 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $20 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.        42           Investments   Investment Valuation   The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of March 31, 2013:           Quoted                              Prices                              in Active                           Markets for  Significant    Significant               Identical     Observable  Unobservable             Assets     Inputs    Inputs    Total          (Level 1)     (Level 2)    (Level 3)    Fair Value      Priced by third party pricing services    $ 635   $ 72,113   $ -   $ 72,748      Priced by independent broker quotations       -     -     3,039     3,039     Priced by matrices      -     11,404     -     11,404     Priced by other methods (1)      -     -     1,172     1,172     Total    $ 635   $ 83,517   $ 4,211   $ 88,363                                  Percent of total      1 %   94 %   5 %   100 %         (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.      For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2012 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.   As of March 31, 2013, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2013, we used broker quotes for 61 securities as our final price source, representing approximately 1% of total securities owned.   Derivatives   Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Guaranteed Living Benefits (“GLB”)   Within our individual annuity business, approximately 71% of our variable annuity account values contained GLB features as of March 31, 2013. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, 6% and 10%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, was $415 million and $548 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.        43            For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.   Acquisitions and Dispositions   The loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012, related to a purchase price adjustment associated with the termination of a portion of the investment advisory agreement with Delaware Management Holdings, Inc., our former subsidiary.   For information about acquisitions and divestitures, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Acquisitions and Dispositions” and Note 3 in our 2012 Form 10-K.   RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS   Details underlying the consolidated results, deposits, net flows and account values (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Net Income (Loss)                      Income (loss) from operations:                      Annuities  $ 159   $ 137     16 %   Retirement Plan Services    35     35     0 %   Life Insurance    112     139     -19 %   Group Protection    14     16     -13 %   Other Operations    (35 )   (34 )   -3 %   Excluded realized gain (loss), after-tax    (60 )   (73 )   18 %     Income (expense) from reserve changes (net of related amortization) on business sold through reinsurance, after-tax      -     1     -100 %   Benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax    14     23     -39 %    Income (loss) from continuing operations, after-tax     239     244     -2 %    Income (loss) from discontinued operations, after-tax     -     (1 )   100 %   Net income (loss)  $ 239   $ 243     -2 %          44                    For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Deposits                      Annuities  $ 3,219   $ 2,480     30 %   Retirement Plan Services    1,667     1,511     10 %   Life Insurance    1,240     1,159     7 %   Total deposits  $ 6,126   $ 5,150     19 %                          Net Flows                      Annuities  $ 885   $ 293     202 %   Retirement Plan Services    344     212     62 %   Life Insurance    848     741     14 %   Total net flows  $ 2,077   $ 1,246     67 %             As of March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Account Values                      Annuities  $ 101,414   $ 91,668     11 %   Retirement Plan Services    46,442     42,020     11 %   Life Insurance    38,018     36,008     6 %   Total account values  $ 185,874   $ 169,696     10 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   Net income decreased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher death claims;        ·    Spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates; and        ·    Less favorable investment income on alternative investments.      The decrease in net income was partially offset by the growth in account values, insurance in force and group earned premiums.         45           RESULTS OF ANNUITIES   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Annuities (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums (1)  $ 33   $ 17     94 %   Insurance fees    369     325     14 %   Net investment income    257     272     -6 %   Operating realized gain (loss)    31     27     15 %   Other revenues and fees (2)    87     90     -3 %   Total operating revenues    777     731     6 %   Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    153     171     -11 %   Benefits    65     45     44 %   Commissions and other expenses    365     353     3 %   Total operating expenses    583     569     2 %   Income (loss) from operations before taxes    194     162     20 %   Federal income tax expense (benefit)    35     25     40 %   Income (loss) from operations  $ 159   $ 137     16 %         (1)    Includes primarily our single-premium immediate annuities (“SPIA”), which have a corresponding offset in benefits for changes in reserves.        (2)    Consists primarily of fees attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to higher insurance fees driven by higher average daily variable account values (see the “Account Value Information” table within “Insurance Fees” below for drivers of changes in our account values).   The increase in income from operations was partially offset by higher commissions and other expenses due to higher account values driving higher trail commissions.   Additional Information   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. We continue to monitor the marketplace and economic environment and make changes to our product offerings as needed to sustain the future profitability of our segment. In 2012, these changes included the introduction of the suite of Protected Funds riders, the introduction of additional Protected Strategies funds, reductions to withdrawal rates for several guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”) riders, closure of the bonus share class variable annuity contracts, and targeted commission reductions for certain fixed indexed annuity products.   The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 8% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out        46           of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below. For detail on the operating realized gain (loss), see “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.

Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, account values and net flows (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Insurance Fees                      Mortality, expense and other assessments  $ 364   $ 320     14 %   Surrender charges    5     6     -17 %   DFEL:                      Deferrals    (5 )   (6 )   17 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking    5     5     0 %   Total insurance fees  $ 369   $ 325     14 %           As of or For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Account Value Information                      Variable annuity deposits (1)  $ 2,157   $ 1,472     47 %   Increases (decreases) in variable annuity account values:                      Net flows (1)    333     (166 )  NM      Change in market value (1)    3,715     5,544     -33 %     Transfers to the variable portion of variable annuity products from the fixed portion of variable annuity products      762     671     14 %   Variable annuity account values (1)    80,312     71,059     13 %   Average daily variable annuity account values (1)    78,489     69,003     14 %   Average daily S&P 500    1,514.89     1,346.25     13 %         (1)    Excludes the fixed portion of variable.      We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Insurance fees include charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but exclude the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial        47           Condition and Results of Operations – Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” in our 2012 Form 10-K for discussion of these attributed fees.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Net Investment Income                       Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 227   $ 240     -5 %    Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums (1)     4     2     100 %   Surplus investments (2)    26     30     -13 %   Total net investment income  $ 257   $ 272     -6 %                        Interest Credited                      Amount provided to contract holders  $ 144   $ 168     -14 %   DSI deferrals    (2 )   (9 )   78 %   Interest credited before DSI amortization    142     159     -11 %   DSI amortization, excluding unlocking    11     12     -8 %   Total interest credited  $ 153   $ 171     -11 %         (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the contract holders of our fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Benefits for this segment include changes in reserves of immediate annuity account values driven by premiums, changes in benefit reserves and our expected costs associated with purchases of derivatives used to hedge our benefit ratio unlocking. In addition, see footnote 1 under the "Income (Loss) from Operations" table above for a discussion of the increase in benefits.         49           Commissions and Other Expenses   Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change                           Commissions and Other Expenses                      Commissions:                      Deferrable  $ 142   $ 110     29 %   Non-deferrable    87     73     19 %   General and administrative expenses    95     98     -3 %    Inter-segment reimbursement associated with reserve financing and LOC expenses (1)     1     -    NM      Taxes, licenses and fees    10     8     25 %   Total expenses incurred, excluding broker-dealer    335     289     16 %   DAC deferrals    (163 )   (124 )   -31 %    Total pre-broker-dealer expenses incurred, excluding amortization, net of interest     172     165     4 %   DAC and VOBA amortization, net of interest:                      Unlocking    2     -    NM      Amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking    103     98     5 %   Broker-dealer expenses incurred    88     90     -2 %   Total commissions and other expenses  $ 365   $ 353     3 %                        DAC Deferrals                      As a percentage of sales/deposits    5.1 %   5.0 %               (1)    Represents reimbursements to Annuities from the Life Insurance segment for reserve financing, net of expenses incurred by Annuities for its use of letters of credit (“LOCs”). The inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).      Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain of our commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.     Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues and fees.         50           RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended            March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance fees  $ 56   $ 52     8 %   Net investment income    202     197     3 %   Other revenues and fees (1)    2     3     -33 %   Total operating revenues    260     252     3 %   Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    117     111     5 %   Commissions and other expenses    95     94     1 %   Total operating expenses    212     205     3 %   Income (loss) from operations before taxes    48     47     2 %   Federal income tax expense (benefit)    13     12     8 %   Income (loss) from operations  $ 35   $ 35     0 %         (1)    Consists primarily of mutual fund account program fees for mid to large employers.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   Income from operations for this segment remained flat due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher insurance fees driven by higher average daily account values (see the “Account Value Information” table within “Insurance Fees” below for drivers of changes in our account values);    entirely offset by:     ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher account values driving higher trail commissions; and        ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by:        §    Spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields, partially offset by actions implemented to reduce interest crediting rates;    partially offset by:     §    Higher average fixed account values (see the “Other Information” table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our account values); and        §    Higher prepayment and bond make-whole premiums (see “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for more information).      Additional Information   We expect to continue making strategic investments during 2013 to improve our infrastructure and expand distribution that will result in higher expenses.   Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year, and we expect this trend will continue during 2013.   New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to 13% for the corresponding period in 2012.          51           Our lapse rate is negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Total Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of their surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 35% and 39% as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.   Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A.

We charge expense assessments to cover insurance and administrative expenses. Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

RESULTS OF LIFE INSURANCE   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Life Insurance (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums  $ 113   $ 109     4 %   Insurance fees    533     524     2 %   Net investment income    585     588     -1 %   Operating realized gain (loss)    6     -    NM      Other revenues and fees    8     6     33 %   Total operating revenues    1,245     1,227     1 %   Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    324     312     4 %   Benefits    505     469     8 %   Commissions and other expenses    249     239     4 %   Total operating expenses    1,078     1,020     6 %   Income (loss) from operations before taxes    167     207     -19 %   Federal income tax expense (benefit)    55     68     -19 %   Income (loss) from operations  $ 112   $ 139     -19 %          56             Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to the following:       ·    Higher benefits due to higher death claims;        ·    Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by:        §    Spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields, partially offset by lower interest crediting rates; and        §    Lower investment income on alternative investments (see “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for more information);    partially offset by:     §    Growth in business in force; and        ·    Higher commissions and other expenses attributable primarily to the effect of favorable unlocking during 2012.      The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by higher insurance fees due to growth in business in force.   Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain   Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk-based capital (“RBC”) levels above current regulatory required levels. Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”), respectively. On September 12, 2012, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted revisions to AG38. Effective as of December 31, 2012, reserves on in-force business written between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, are subject to a new minimum floor calculation. This floor calculation is based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the principles-based reserving framework developed by the NAIC. The AG38 revisions did not have a material impact on our total in-force reserves as of December 31, 2012. Reserves on new business written after December 31, 2012, are calculated using a modified formulaic approach. This new approach will result in higher reserves that will exceed expected economic levels, which will increase the surplus strain related to new sales. However, our insurance subsidiaries are employing strategies to reduce the surplus strain of holding the higher statutory reserves associated with term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. As noted below, we have been successful in executing reinsurance solutions to release surplus to Other Operations. We will continue to manage our present reinsurance solutions and enter into new solutions to minimize the strain on our surplus.   Included in the LOCs issued as of March 31, 2013, was approximately $2.6 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements. For UL products containing secondary guarantees, there were approximately $75 million of such LOCs issued which will expire in 2015 and $1.7 billion which will expire in 2031. Approximately $855 million of such LOCs were issued for term business that will expire in 2023. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of approximately $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital effect of term and UL products containing secondary guarantees. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could affect our returns on our in-force UL products containing secondary guarantees. However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures are not available. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” in our 2012 Form 10-K for further information on XXX and AG38 reserves. See the table in “Commissions and Other Expenses” below for the presentation of our expenses associated with reserve financing.   Additional Information   We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.   For information on interest rate spreads, see “Part I – Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” herein. For information on the interest rate risk due to falling interest rates, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second        57           half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest. However, we face conditions in the marketplace as discussed in “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Executive Summary – Current Market Conditions” in our 2012 Form 10-K that may continue to challenge our sales volume in 2013. For example, we are implementing pricing changes to our products that reflect the current low interest rate environment that we believe will lower our sales volumes and could potentially reduce our market share until competitive conditions change.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below. For detail on the operating realized gain (loss), see “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Insurance Premiums   Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   Insurance Fees   Details underlying insurance fees, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Insurance Fees                      Mortality assessments  $ 332   $ 334     -1 %   Expense assessments    213     205     4 %   Surrender charges    16     23     -30 %   DFEL:                      Deferrals    (77 )   (83 )   7 %   Amortization, net of interest:                      Unlocking    -     (6 )   100 %   Amortization, net of interest, excluding unlocking    49     51     -4 %   Total insurance fees  $ 533   $ 524     2 %           58                    For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Sales by Product                      UL:                      Excluding MoneyGuard®  $ 40   $ 47     -15 %   MoneyGuard®    45     41     10 %   Total UL    85     88     -3 %   VUL    23     10     130 %   COLI and BOLI    26     11     136 %   Term    16     13     23 %   Total sales  $ 150   $ 122     23 %                          Net Flows                      Deposits  $ 1,240   $ 1,159     7 %   Withdrawals and deaths    (392 )   (418 )   6 %   Net flows  $ 848   $ 741     14 %                          Contract holder assessments  $ 828   $ 805     3 %             As of March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Account Values                      UL  $ 29,727   $ 28,341     5 %   VUL    6,032     5,376     12 %   Interest-sensitive whole life    2,259     2,291     -1 %   Total account values  $ 38,018   $ 36,008     6 %                          In-Force Face Amount                      UL and other  $ 311,588   $ 307,957     1 %   Term insurance    282,463     272,006     4 %   Total in-force face amount  $ 594,051   $ 579,963     2 %     Insurance fees relate only to interest-sensitive products and include mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:       ·    MoneyGuard® (our linked-benefit product) – 15% of single premium deposits;        ·    MoneyGuard® (flexible premium option), UL (excluding linked-benefit products) and VUL (including corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”)) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and        ·    Term – 100% of annualized first year premiums.      UL products with secondary guarantees represented approximately 18% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013, as compared to approximately 30% for the corresponding period in 2012. Changes in the marketplace and continuing efforts to increase sales of higher return in a low interest rate environment products are resulting in a shift in our business mix to products like VUL, indexed UL and term that are not primarily focused upon secondary guarantees.         59           Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Net Investment Income                       Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and other, net of investment expenses   $ 553   $ 540     2 %    Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums (1)     3     2     50 %   Alternative investments (2)    -     15     -100 %   Surplus investments (3)    29     31     -6 %   Total net investment income  $ 585   $ 588     -1 %   Interest Credited  $ 324   $ 312     4 %         (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities, which can be affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements, and leads to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations for use in other corporate purposes. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Benefits   Details underlying benefits (dollars in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Benefits                      Death claims direct and assumed  $ 865   $ 803     8 %   Death claims ceded    (405 )   (415 )   2 %   Reserves released on death    (139 )   (106 )   -31 %   Net death benefits    321     282     14 %    Change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves:                       Unlocking    -     9     -100 %   Change in reserves, excluding unlocking    131     119     10 %   Other benefits:                      Other benefits, excluding unlocking (1)    53     59     -10 %   Total benefits  $ 505   $ 469     8 %   Death claims per $1,000 of in-force    2.17     1.95     11 %         (1)    Includes primarily traditional product changes in reserves and dividends.      Benefits for this segment includes claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits includes the change in secondary guarantee life insurance product reserves. The reserve for secondary guarantees is affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to this liability similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

RESULTS OF GROUP PROTECTION   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Operating Revenues                      Insurance premiums  $ 508   $ 463     10 %   Net investment income    39     38     3 %   Other revenues and fees    3     3     0 %   Total operating revenues    550     504     9 %   Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    1     1     0 %   Benefits    384     350     10 %   Commissions and other expenses    143     128     12 %   Total operating expenses    528     479     10 %   Income (loss) from operations before taxes    22     25     -12 %   Federal income tax expense (benefit)    8     9     -11 %   Income (loss) from operations  $ 14   $ 16     -13 %           62                    For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change       Income (Loss) from Operations by Product Line                       Life  $ (1 ) $ 2    NM      Disability    14     14     0 %   Dental    -     (1 )   100 %   Total non-medical    13     15     -13 %   Medical    1     1     0 %   Income (loss) from operations  $ 14   $ 16     -13 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to higher commissions and other expenses attributable to strategic investments in sales and distribution processes and technology platforms as well as an increase in business and higher than expected mortality experience within our life business.   The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by growth in insurance premiums driven by normal, organic business growth in our non-medical products.   Additional Information   Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. During the first quarter of 2013, our total non-medical loss ratio of 74.8% was above our long-term expectation of 71% to 74% due primarily to adverse mortality experience on our life business. Non-medical loss ratios in general are likely to remain at the high end of our long-term expectation of 71% to 74% during 2013. For every one percent increase in the loss ratio above our expectation, we would expect an approximate annual $11 million to $13 million decrease to income from operations.   We are evaluating the potential effects that health care reform may have on the value and profitability of this segment’s products and income from operations, including, but not limited to, potential changes to traditional sources of income for our brokers who may seek additional portfolio options and/or modification to compensation structures.   For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Sales relate to long-duration contracts sold to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time.   We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products.   Net Investment Income   We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.

The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.         65           RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS   Income (Loss) from Operations   Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Operating Revenues                      Net investment income  $ 66   $ 70     -6 %    Amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance     18     18     0 %   Media revenues (net)    17     17     0 %   Other revenues and fees    1     1     0 %   Total operating revenues    102     106     -4 %   Operating Expenses                      Interest credited    27     31     -13 %   Benefits    27     28     -4 %   Media expenses    15     16     -6 %   Other expenses    25     20     25 %   Interest and debt expense    64     68     -6 %   Total operating expenses    158     163     -3 %    Income (loss) from operations before taxes     (56 )   (57 )   2 %   Federal income tax expense (benefit)    (21 )   (23 )   9 %   Income (loss) from operations  $ (35 ) $ (34 )   -3 %     Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   Loss from operations for Other Operations remained relatively flat due primarily to growth in other expenses driven by an increase in our stock price and its effect on our deferred compensation plans (see “Other Expenses” below for more information), offset by lower interest and debt expense driven by a decline in rates.   Additional Information   We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Net Investment Income and Interest Credited   We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If regulations require increases in our insurance segments’ statutory reserves and surplus, the amount of capital retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.   Write-downs for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) decrease the recorded value of our invested assets owned by our business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our operating segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments’ portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations, but should not have an effect on a consolidated basis unless the impairments are related to defaulted securities. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of invested assets between the affected segments and Other Operations.        66           The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.   Benefits   Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.   Other Expenses   Details underlying other expenses (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Other Expenses                      General and administrative expenses:                      Legal  $ -   $ 1     -100 %   Branding    3     9     -67 %   Other (1)    23     12     92 %   Total general and administrative expenses    26     22     18 %   Restructuring charges    1     -    NM      Taxes, licenses and fees     1     1     0 %    Inter-segment reimbursement associated with reserve financing and LOC expenses (2)     (3 )   (3 )   0 %   Total other expenses  $ 25   $ 20     25 %         (1)    Includes expenses that are corporate in nature including charitable contributions, amortization of media intangible assets with a definite life, the portion of our deferred compensation plan expense attributable to participants’ selection of LNC stock as the measure for their investment return and other expenses not allocated to our business segments.        (2)    Consists of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its use of LOCs.      Interest and Debt Expense   Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”   Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 to 2012   We had lower realized losses during 2013 as compared to 2012 driven primarily by the following components of excluded realized gain (loss), which we have described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax:       ·    Lower losses on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2013 attributable to less narrowing of our credit spreads during 2013 resulting in a less unfavorable GLB NPR component;                       68               ·    Lower gross realized losses during 2013 related to certain investments originating from asset sales to reposition the investment portfolio (see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below for more information); and        ·    General improvement in the credit markets during 2013 leading to a decline in OTTI (see “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below for more information).      The lower realized losses during 2013 as compared to 2012 were partially offset by lower realized gains on the mark-to-market on certain instruments during 2013 attributable to less narrowing of spreads on corporate credit default swaps related to our consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”).   Operating Realized Gain (Loss)   See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion of our operating realized gain (loss).   Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   See “Consolidated Investments – Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments” below.   Gain (Loss) on the Mark-to-Market on Certain Instruments   See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Gain (Loss) on the Mark-to-Market on Certain Instruments” in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion on the mark-to-market on certain instruments and Note 3 for information about consolidated variable interest entities.   Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results   See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion of our variable annuity net derivatives results.   The variable annuity hedge program ended the first quarter of 2013 with assets of $1.2 billion, which were in excess of the estimated liability of $404 million as of March 31, 2013.   As of March 31, 2013, the net effect of the NPR resulted in a $123 million decrease in the liability for our GLB embedded derivative reserves.   Details underlying the NPR component and associated effect to our GLB embedded derivative reserves (dollars in millions) were as follows:           As of     As of     As of     As of     As of          March 31,     December 31,     September 30,     June 30,     March 31,          2013     2012     2012     2012     2012      10-year credit default swap (“CDS”) spread    1.86 %   2.34 %   2.40 %   3.48 %   2.40 %   NPR factor related to 10-year CDS spread    0.19 %   0.26 %   0.29 %   0.45 %   0.25 %   Unadjusted embedded derivative liability  $ 200   $ 975   $ 1,432   $ 2,126   $ 1,093       Estimating what the absolute amount of the NPR effect will be period to period is difficult due to the utilization of all cash flows and the shape of the spread curve. Currently, we estimate that if the NPR factors as of March 31, 2013, were to have been zero along all points on the spread curve, then the NPR offset to the unadjusted liability would have resulted in an unfavorable effect to net income of approximately $170 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax. Alternatively, if the NPR factors were 20 basis points higher along all points on the spread curve as of March 31, 2013, then there would have been a favorable effect to net income of approximately $70 million, pre-DAC and pre-tax. In the preceding two sentences, “DAC” refers to the associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL. Changing market conditions could cause this relationship to deviate significantly in future periods. Sensitivity within this range is primarily a result of volatility in our CDS spreads and the slope of the CDS spread term structure.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion on our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification   Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.   We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.   Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios   Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both of the AFS and trading portfolios.         70            Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.

Refer to “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios – Trading Securities” in our 2012 Form 10-K for further details.           72            AFS Securities   In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.   The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:           Rating Agency     As of March 31, 2013       As of December 31, 2012      NAIC     Equivalent     Amortized     Fair     % of       Amortized     Fair     % of      Designation (1)     Designation (1)     Cost     Value     Total       Cost     Value     Total                                                     Investment Grade Securities                                             1    Aaa / Aa / A    $ 41,837   $ 47,832     57.2 %   $ 41,477   $ 47,913     57.9 %    2    Baa      28,980     31,747     38.1 %     27,914     30,995     37.5 %   Total investment grade securities      70,817     79,579     95.3 %     69,391     78,908     95.4 %                                                    Below Investment Grade Securities                                             3    Ba      2,408     2,469     3.0 %     2,425     2,468     2.9 %    4   B     1,157     1,081     1.3 %     1,171     1,070     1.3 %    5    Caa and lower      279     225     0.3 %     331     246     0.3 %    6    In or near default      96     65     0.1 %     77     52     0.1 %   Total below investment grade securities      3,940     3,840     4.7 %     4,004     3,836     4.6 %   Total fixed maturity AFS securities    $ 74,757   $ 83,419     100.0 %   $ 73,395   $ 82,744     100.0 %                                                      Total securities below investment grade as a percentage of total fixed maturity AFS securities      5.3 %   4.6 %           5.5 %   4.6 %                (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the NAIC or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings.         Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, or rated BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).    We have identified select countries in Europe that are currently experiencing stress in the credit markets, notably Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Cyprus and Slovenia. These countries were identified due to high credit spreads and political and economic uncertainty. Our exposure was determined by country of risk, defined as the country where the issuer primarily         73            conducts business, unless another company is deemed to have control. Our investments by country as of March 31, 2013, are presented below (in millions). We have no exposure to any issuers in Greece, Hungary, Cyprus or Slovenia.

The risk management is focused on monitoring spreads, pricing and monitoring of global economic developments. We have incorporated these risks into our stress testing.   As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, 75.6% and 68.7%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. See Note 4 for maturity date information for our fixed maturity investment portfolio. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in OCI, on AFS securities as of March 31, 2013, decreased $27 million. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2013, does not represent OTTI as (i) we do not intend to sell these debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.   Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) as of March 31, 2013, was as follows:                 Gross     Estimated     Estimated                            Unrealized     Years     Average                            Losses     Until Call     Years                      Fair     and     or     Until     Subordination Level          Value     OTTI     Maturity     Recovery     Current     Origination      CMBS  $ 94   $ 31    1 to 40    29   24.8 % 15.4 %    Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities     344     68    1 to 53    28   N/A   N/A        As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2012 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.   The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.       We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This         74            conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:         ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;        ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;        ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;        ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;        ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and        ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.        To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:         ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;          ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;        ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;        ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and        ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.          As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $102.4 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $85.4 billion as of March 31, 2013. If it were necessary to liquidate securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $76.9 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $708 million, as of March 31, 2013, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point of time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.       See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K and Note 4 for additional discussion.    As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $12.3 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, representing 12% of total invested assets.    For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 3 in this report and Note 4 in our 2012 Form 10-K.    Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)    See “Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2012 Form 10-K for a discussion of our MBS.   Our RMBS had a market value of $5.8 billion and an unrealized gain of $401 million, or 7%, as of March 31, 2013.        75               The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $452 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of March 31, 2013. AFS securities represented $438 million, or 97%, and trading securities represented $14 million, or 3%, of the subprime exposure as of March 31, 2013.

Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities   When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the status of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the status of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios.

These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.   See Note 4 for information regarding our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios.   As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, there were 6 and 10 impaired mortgage loans on real estate, respectively, or 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of March 31, 2013, was $11 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of March 31, 2013, was $1 million. The carrying value on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2012, was $20 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of December 31, 2012, was $7 million. See Note 1 in our 2012 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans on real estate.   Alternative Investments   Investment income (loss) on alternative investments by business segment (in millions) was as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Annuities  $ 2   $ 6     -67 %   Retirement Plan Services    1     3     -67 %   Life Insurance    2     20     -90 %   Group Protection    1     2     -50 %   Total (1)  $ 6   $ 31     -81 %         (1)    Includes net investment income on the alternative investments supporting the required statutory surplus of our insurance businesses.      As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, alternative investments included investments in 100 and 98 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.         80           As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Valuation of Alternative Investments” in our 2012 Form 10-K, we update the carrying value of our alternative investment portfolio whenever audited financial statements of the investees for the preceding year become available. Net investment income (loss) derived from our consolidated alternative investments by segment (in millions) related to the effect of preceding year audit adjustments recorded during the indicated year at the investee was as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Annuities  $ 1   $ 4     -75 %   Retirement Plan Services    1     2     -50 %   Life Insurance    2     13     -85 %   Group Protection    -     2     -100 %   Total  $ 4   $ 21     -81 %     Non-Income Producing Investments   As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $15 million and $14 million, respectively.   Net Investment Income   Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Net Investment Income                      Fixed maturity AFS securities  $ 987   $ 969     2 %   Equity AFS securities    2     1     100 %   Trading securities    34     37     -8 %   Mortgage loans on real estate    99     101     -2 %   Real estate    3     4     -25 %   Policy loans    38     46     -17 %   Invested cash    1     1     0 %    Commercial mortgage loan prepayment and bond make-whole premiums (1)     12     6     100 %   Alternative investments (2)    6     31     -81 %   Consent fees    1     -    NM      Other investments    (4 )   (4 )   0 %   Investment income    1,179     1,192     -1 %   Investment expense    (29 )   (26 )   -12 %   Net investment income  $ 1,150   $ 1,166     -1 %         (1)    See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.   Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums   Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.   The increase in prepayment and make-whole premiums when comparing 2013 to 2012 was attributable primarily to increased refinancing activity.         82           Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments   The detail of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) was as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Fixed maturity AFS securities:                      Gross gains  $ 7   $ 5     40 %   Gross losses    (19 )   (63 )   70 %   Equity AFS securities:                      Gross gains    6     1    NM      Gain (loss) on other investments    (1 )   7    NM      Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, and                      DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds    (7 )   2    NM       Total realized gain (loss) related to certain investments, pre-tax   $ (14 ) $ (48 )   71 %     Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest-rate related impairments.   Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first three months of 2013 and 2012, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.   We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.   When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2012 Form 10-K for additional information on our portfolio management strategy.         83           Details underlying write-downs taken as a result of OTTI (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      OTTI Recognized in Net Income (Loss)                      Corporate bonds  $ (3 ) $ (19 )   84 %   RMBS    (11 )   (18 )   39 %   CMBS    (2 )   (20 )   90 %   CDOs    (1 )   -    NM      Gross OTTI recognized in net income (loss)    (17 )   (57 )          Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL     3     10     -70 %    Net OTTI recognized in net income (loss), pre-tax   $ (14 ) $ (47 )   70 %                          Portion of OTTI Recognized in OCI                      Gross OTTI recognized in OCI  $ 7   $ 58     -88 %   Change in DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL    (1 )   (8 )   88 %   Net portion of OTTI recognized in OCI, pre-tax  $ 6   $ 50     -88 %     The decrease in write-downs for OTTI when comparing the first three months of 2013 to the same period in 2012 was primarily attributable to declines in write-downs for OTTI on corporate bonds and structured holdings. The improvements of the write-downs for OTTI on our RMBS and CMBS holdings were primarily attributable to gradual recovery in both residential and commercial real estate markets. The write-downs of our structured holdings are due primarily to idiosyncratic risk that affect individual securities rather than overall market weakness.   The $24 million of impairments taken during the first three months of 2013 were split between $17 million of credit-related impairments and $7 million of noncredit-related impairments. The credit-related impairments were largely attributable to our RMBS holdings primarily as a result of continued weakness within the residential real estate market that affected select RMBS holdings. The noncredit-related impairments were incurred due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.   REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow   Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided (used) cash of $(251) million, which was attributable primarily to timing of cash receipts and payments, and $282 million for the first three months of 2013 and 2012, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.   The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post for our counterparties’ benefit would also decline (or increase). During the first three months of 2013, our payables for collateral on derivative        84           investments decreased by $576 million as steadily rising equity markets and less volatility lowered the fair values of the associated derivative investments. For additional information, see “Credit Risk” in Note 5.   Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:         For the Three              Months Ended              March 31,              2013     2012     Change      Dividends from Subsidiaries                       The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company ("LNL")   $ 150   $ 150     0 %    Loan Repayments and Interest from Subsidiaries                       Interest on inter-company notes    13     33     -61 %    $ 163   $ 183     -11 %   Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                        Net capital received from (paid for taxes on) stock option exercises and restricted stock    $ (4 ) $ (1 )  NM        The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.   Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus   For discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased AG38 and XXX statutory reserves associated with certain UL products and other products with secondary guarantees on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”   Financing Activities   Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.   We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.         85           Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:                For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013                          Change                                Maturities     in Fair                    Beginning           and     Value     Other     Ending        Balance     Issuance     Repayments     Hedges    Changes (1)    Balance      Short-Term Debt                                        Current maturities of long-term debt (2)  $ 200   $ -   $ -   $ -   $ 506   $ 706                                            Long-Term Debt                                        Senior notes  $ 3,978   $ -   $ -   $ (42 ) $ (508 ) $ 3,428     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                        Indianapolis ("FHLBI") advance    250     -     -     -     -     250     Capital securities    1,211     -     -     -     -     1,211     Total long-term debt  $ 5,439   $ -   $ -   $ (42 ) $ (508 ) $ 4,889           (1)    Includes non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.        (2)    Consists of a $200 million floating rate loan maturing on July 18, 2013, a $300 million 4.75% fixed rate senior note maturing on January 30, 2014 and a $200 million 4.75% fixed rate senior note maturing on February 15, 2014.      There are no maturing loans within the next two years in addition to those discussed above. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet these maturities will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of March 31, 2013, the holding company had available liquidity of $647 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held as collateral, investments maturing in one year or less at origination and receivables under the inter-company cash management program, less payables under the inter-company cash management program, payables from purchases of securities not settled as of the balance sheet date and commercial paper outstanding.   For information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2012 Form 10-K.   We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales and do not have any other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa2 (S&P/Moody’s) as of March 31, 2013. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2012 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2012 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.   See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2012 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.    Alternative Sources of Liquidity    In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans, which are permitted under applicable insurance laws, among LNC and its affiliates that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party        86           transaction costs. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently the lesser of 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets and 25% of its surplus, in both cases, as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC. The holding company did not borrow from the cash management program during the first quarter of 2013; however, it had an outstanding receivable of $286 million from certain subsidiaries resulting from funds borrowed by the subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed by those subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account as of March 31, 2013. Any increase (decrease) in either of these holding company cash management program payable balances results in an immediate and equal increase (decrease) to holding company cash and cash equivalents.   Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of March 31, 2013, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $2.1 billion out on loan or subject to reverse-repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.   For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Divestitures   For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2012 Form 10-K.   Uses of Capital   Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.   Return of Capital to Common Stockholders   One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.   Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Common dividends to stockholders  $ 33   $ 23     43 %   Repurchase of common stock    100     150     -33 %   Total cash returned to stockholders  $ 133   $ 173     -23 %                          Number of shares repurchased    3.372     6.018     -44 %   Average price per share  $ 29.67   $ 24.90     19 %     On November 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.08 to $0.12 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during 2013 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.         87           Other Uses of Capital   In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:           For the Three                Months Ended                March 31,                2013     2012     Change      Debt service (interest paid)  $ 56   $ 59     -5 %     The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.   Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow   As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   OTHER MATTERS   Other Factors Affecting Our Business   In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2012 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that takes diversification into account. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit related derivatives risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives are designated as a hedge and serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are: substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).         88            Interest Rate Risk    Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates   There were no material changes to our earnings sensitivity analysis disclosed in “Part II – Item 7A. – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” in our 2012 Form 10-K.   The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the March 31, 2013, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the first quarter of 2013 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:         Account Values           Retirement              %              Plan     Life           Account        Annuities     Services     Insurance  (1)  Total     Values      Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                  Discretionary rate setting products (2)(3)                                  No difference  $ 8,480   $ 9,968   $ 27,047   $ 45,495     70.7 %   Up to 0.10%    66     4     -     70     0.1 %   0.11% to 0.20%    78     -     -     78     0.1 %   0.21% to 0.30%    78     -     252     330     0.5 %   0.31% to 0.40%    104     12     -     116     0.2 %   0.41% to 0.50%    80     427     -     507     0.8 %   0.51% to 0.60%    65     -     -     65     0.1 %   0.61% to 0.70%    47     -     -     47     0.1 %   0.71% to 0.80%    50     -     -     50     0.1 %   0.81% to 0.90%    54     -     -     54     0.1 %   0.91% to 1.00%    38     138     -     176     0.3 %   1.01% to 1.50%    111     15     -     126     0.2 %   1.51% to 2.00%    34     -     244     278     0.4 %   2.01% to 2.50%    15     -     -     15     0.0 %   2.51% to 3.00%    4     -     -     4     0.0 %   Multi-year guarantee and indexed annuity products (4)    10,385     -     -     10,385     16.1 %   Total discretionary rate setting products     19,689     10,564     27,543     57,796     89.8 %   Other contracts (5)    2,224     4,332     -     6,556     10.2 %   Total account values  $ 21,913   $ 14,896   $ 27,543   $ 64,352     100.0 %                                     Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account values at minimum guaranteed rates     43.1 %   94.4 %   98.2 %   78.7 %               (1)    Excludes policy loans.        (2)    Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.        (3)    The average crediting rates for discretionary rate setting products, excluding multi-year guarantee and indexed annuity products, were 6 basis points, 3 basis points and 2 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.        (4)    The average crediting rates were 106 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for multi-year guarantee and indexed annuity products. For the multi-year guarantee products 17%, 12% and 71% of our total multi-year guarantee account values are scheduled to reset in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and beyond, respectively. Our indexed renewal business resets either annually or bi-annually. Upon reset, we are able to adjust product features to reflect changes in option prices.        (5)    For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to immediate annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 1 basis point in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates and 95% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.           89            The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   Derivatives   See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.   Equity Market Risk   Our revenues, assets, liabilities and derivatives are exposed to equity market risk. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2012 Form 10-K for further discussion on the effects of equity markets on our RTM.   Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity   The following presents our estimate of the effect on income (loss) from operations (in millions), from the change in asset-based fees and related expenses, if the level of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”), which ended at 1569 as of March 31, 2013, were to decrease to 1255 over six months after March 31, 2013, and remain at that level through the next six months or increase to 1883 over six months after March 31, 2013, and remain at that level through the next six months, excluding any effect related to sales, unlocking, persistency, hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change:           S&P 500     S&P 500          at 1255 (1)     at 1883 (1)      Segment            Annuities  $ (97 ) $ 64     Retirement Plan Services    (10 )   10           (1)    The baseline for these effects assumes a 4% annual equity market growth rate, depending on the block of business, beginning on April 1, 2013. The baseline is then compared to scenarios of the S&P 500 at the 1255 and 1883 levels, and the difference is presented in the table.      The effect on earnings summarized above is a hypothetical scenario for the next 12 months. The effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset-based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values. The difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods. Additionally, the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets. This discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative. Actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts, switching among investment alternatives available within variable products, changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency. For purposes of this guidance, the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index.   Credit-Related Derivatives   We use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 5 for additional information.   Credit Risk     See Note 5 for information on our credit risk.          90           In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:           As of     As of            March 31,  December 31,         2013     2012        Rating                  AA  $ 4   $ 1      A   63     14       Total  $ 67   $ 15         Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2013, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
