Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2014; and our current reports on Form 8-K filed in 2014.        In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Financial information that follows is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. See Note 1 in our 2013 Form 10-K for a discussion of GAAP.       Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 13. Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses because the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business.        FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE       Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “will,” “shall” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.        Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:          ·    Deterioration in general economic and business conditions that may affect account values, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels, claims experience and the level of pension benefit costs, funding and investment results;     ·    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;     ·    Because of our holding company structure, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    ·    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products, the required amount of reserves and/or surplus, or otherwise affect our ability to conduct business, including changes to statutory reserve requirements related to secondary guarantee universal life and annuities; regulations regarding captive reinsurance arrangements; restrictions on revenue sharing and 12b‑1 payments; and the potential for U.S. federal tax reform;    ·    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;     ·    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses, estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) and demand for our products;     ·    Rapidly increasing interest rates causing contract holders to surrender life insurance and annuity policies, thereby causing realized investment losses, and reduced hedge performance related to variable annuities;    ·    Uncertainty about the effect of rules and regulations to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) on us and the economy and financial services sector in particular;    ·    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    44          ·    A decline in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products, a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products, an acceleration of the net amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit features of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    ·    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including various hedging strategies used to offset the effect of changes in the value of liabilities due to changes in the level and volatility of the equity markets and interest rates;    ·    A deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products, in establishing related insurance reserves and in the net amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL, which may reduce future earnings;     ·    Changes in GAAP, including convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), that may result in unanticipated changes to our net income;    ·    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    ·    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    ·    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain investments in our portfolios, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on investments;    ·    Inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others;    ·    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems from cyberattacks or other breaches of our data security systems;    ·    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    ·    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have purchased;    ·    Acts of terrorism, a pandemic, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely affect our businesses and the cost and availability of reinsurance;    ·    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    ·    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from changes in the demographics of their client base, as aging baby-boomers move from the asset-accumulation stage to the asset-distribution stage of life; and    ·    Loss of key management, financial planners or wholesalers.      The risks included here are not exhaustive. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.        Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.        INTRODUCTION       Executive Summary        We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), linked-benefit UL, indexed UL, term life insurance, employer-sponsored retirement plans and services, and group life, disability and dental.       We provide products and services and report results through our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services, Life Insurance and Group Protection segments. We also have Other Operations. These segments and Other Operations are described in “Part I – Item 1. Business” of our 2013 Form 10-K.        For information on how we derive our revenues, see the discussion in results of operations by segment below.       Our current market conditions, significant operational matters, industry trends, issues and outlook are described in “Introduction – Executive Summary” of our 2013 Form 10-K.        For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K.           45          Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       The MD&A included in our 2013 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. The following information updates the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” provided in our 2013 Form 10-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K.       DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL       Unlocking       As discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K, we conduct our annual comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying the amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI, DFEL, embedded derivatives and reserves for life insurance and annuity products with living benefit and death benefit guarantees in the third quarter of each year. As a result of this review, we recorded unlocking on an annual basis that resulted in increases or decreases to the carrying values of these items. See “DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in Note 1 of our 2013 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our unlocking process.        Details underlying the effect to income (loss) from continuing operations from our unlocking as a result of our annual comprehensive review (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                             For the Three                       Months Ended                       September 30,                       2014        2013        Change          Income (loss) from operations:                                      Annuities    $  12 				       $  2 				       NM          Retirement Plan Services      1 				         (4 				   )  125% 				         Life Insurance      (16 				   )      17 				       NM          Excluded realized gain (loss)      25 				         (7 				   )    NM          Income (loss) from continuing                                      operations    $  22 				       $  8 				     175% 				            Unlocking was driven primarily by the following:       2014         ·    For Annuities, we modified our long-term volatility and policyholder behavior assumptions, partially offset by modifying our separate account fees and interest margin assumptions;    ·    For Retirement Plan Services, we modified our separate account fees, maintenance expenses and policyholder behavior assumptions, substantially offset by lowering our interest margin assumption;    ·    For Life Insurance, we modified our mortality/morbidity and premium persistency assumptions and other items, partially offset by modifying our assumptions related to interest margin, policyholder behavior and maintenance expenses; and     ·    For excluded realized gain (loss), we modified our long-term volatility and policyholder behavior assumptions for GLB riders.      2013         ·    For Annuities, we modified our policyholder behavior and variable annuity mortality assumptions, partially offset by modifying our interest margin assumptions and other items;    ·    For Retirement Plan Services, we modified our interest margin assumptions;    ·    For Life Insurance, we modified our amortization period and mortality assumptions, partially offset by lowering our early duration portfolio yield assumptions; and     ·    For excluded realized gain (loss), we modified our policyholder behavior assumptions for GLB riders.      Reversion to the Mean (“RTM”)       As variable fund returns do not move in a systematic manner, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected, which we refer to as our RTM process, as discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K.        Our long-term variable fund growth rate assumption, which is used in the determination of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization for the variable component of our variable annuity and VUL products, is an immediate drop of approximately 14% followed by growth going forward of 7% to 9% depending on the block of business and reflecting differences in contract holder fund allocations between fixed-income and equity-type investments. If we had unlocked our RTM assumption as of September 30, 2014, we would have recorded a favorable unlocking of approximately $280 million, pre-tax, for Annuities, approximately $25 million, pre-tax, for Retirement Plan Services, and approximately $40 million, pre-tax, for Life Insurance.       46          Investments       Investment Valuation        The following summarizes our available-for-sale (“AFS”) and trading securities and derivative investments carried at fair value by pricing source and fair value hierarchy level (in millions) as of September 30, 2014:                                                                                                                                                             Quoted                                                           Prices                                                           in Active                                                           Markets for    Significant    Significant                           Identical    Observable    Unobservable                           Assets    Inputs    Inputs        Total               (Level 1)    (Level 2)    (Level 3)        Fair Value          Priced by third-party pricing services        $  496 				           $  72,548 				           $     -            $  73,044 				         Priced by independent broker quotations             -                 -              2,246 				             2,246 				         Priced by matrices             -              12,978 				                -              12,978 				         Priced by other methods (1)             -                 -              1,420 				             1,420 				         Total        $  496 				           $  85,526 				           $  3,666 				           $  89,688 				                                                                                Percent of total          1% 				             95% 				             4% 				             100% 				              (1)    Represents primarily securities for which pricing models were used to compute fair value.           For more information about the valuation of our financial instruments carried at fair value, see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Investments – Investment Valuation” in our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 12 herein.       As of September 30, 2014, we evaluated the markets that our securities trade in and concluded that none were inactive. We will continue to re-evaluate this conclusion, as needed, based on market conditions. We use unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information. We obtain broker quotes for securities such as synthetic convertibles, index-linked certificates of deposit and collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) when sufficient security structure or other market information is not available to produce an evaluation. For broker-quoted only securities, non-binding quotes from market makers or broker-dealers are obtained from sources recognized as market participants. Broker-quoted securities are based solely on receipt of updated quotes from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant. Our broker-quoted only securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2014, we used broker quotes for 66 securities as our final price source, representing approximately 1% of total securities owned.        Derivatives        Our accounting policies for derivatives and the potential effect on interest spreads in a falling rate environment are discussed in Note 5 of this report and “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       GLB       Within our individual annuity business, approximately 71% of our variable annuity account values contained GLB features as of September 30, 2014. Declines in the equity markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB features, leading to an increase in our existing liability for those benefits. For example, a contract with a GLB feature is “in the money” if the contract holder’s account balance falls below the present value of guaranteed withdrawal or income benefits, assuming no lapses. As of September 30, 2014 and 2013, 4% and 5%, respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB feature were “in the money,” and our exposure, after reinsurance, as of September 30, 2014 and 2013, was $291 million and $387 million, respectively. However, the only way the contract holder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account value of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account value can also fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account value.       For information on our variable annuity hedge program performance, see our discussion in “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Variable Annuity Net Derivatives Results” below.        For information on our estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income, which could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets, interest rates and implied market volatilities, see our discussion in “Part I – Item 2.

(2)    See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.    (3)    Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services that are subject to market volatility.      Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account values.        The increase in income from operations was partially offset primarily by the following:         ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher account values, resulting in higher trail commissions. This increase was partially offset by the effect of unlocking and higher average equity markets than our model projections assumed, both resulting in a lower amortization rate.    ·    Higher benefits attributable to an increase in the growth in benefit reserves due to higher guaranteed amounts covered by GLB riders and the effect of unlocking.      We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values.        See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” for more information about unlocking.       Additional Information       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. We continue to monitor the marketplace and economic environment and make changes to our product offerings as needed to sustain the future profitability of our segment. We are continuing to focus on shifting the balance of variable annuity deposits to products without GLB      49       riders during 2014. Variable annuity deposits on products without GLB riders were 24% and 22% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to 13% and 11% for the corresponding periods in 2013. In July 2014, our primary insurance subsidiary, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”), amended and restated its reinsurance treaty covering new sales of its variable annuity GLB product. The treaty provides an additional $4 billion of reinsurance capacity through December 31, 2015. LNL will retain 100% of the product cash flows, excluding the living benefit guarantee.       The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity products was 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.        Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary crediting rates that are reset on an annual basis and are not subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2013 Form 10-K.

We charge contract holders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account value or the guaranteed amount. In addition, for our fixed annuity contracts and for some variable contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during their surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals. Fee income includes charges on both our variable and fixed annuity products, but excludes the attributed fees on our GLB products; see “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking – Operating Realized Gain (Loss)” in our 2013 Form 10-K for discussion of these attributed fees.           51          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited       Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Net Investment Income                                                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                                                      on real estate and other, net of                                                                      investment expenses    $  213 				       $  219 				       -3%        $  645 				       $  668 				       -3%          Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                                                      and bond make-whole premiums (1)      5 				         5 				     0% 				         14 				         27 				       -48%          Surplus investments (2)      39 				         30 				     30% 				         115 				         89 				     29% 				         Total net investment income    $  257 				       $  254 				     1% 				       $  774 				       $  784 				       -1%                                                                                 Interest Credited                                                                      Amount provided to contract holders    $  146 				       $  150 				       -3%        $  438 				       $  444 				       -1%          DSI deferrals      (1 				   )      (2 				   )  50% 				         (4 				   )      (7 				   )  43% 				         Interest credited before DSI                                                                      amortization      145 				         148 				       -2%          434 				         437 				       -1%          DSI amortization:                                                                      Amortization, excluding unlocking      9 				         11 				       -18%          28 				         32 				       -13%          Unlocking      (2 				   )      (6 				   )  67% 				         (2 				   )      (6 				   )  67% 				         Total interest credited    $  152 				       $  153 				       -1%        $  460 				       $  463 				       -1%               (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

The inter-segment amounts are not reported on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).      Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized over the lives of the contracts in relation to EGPs. Certain types of commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account values, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized.       Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues.           54          RESULTS OF RETIREMENT PLAN SERVICES       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Retirement Plan Services (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                 For the Nine                       Months Ended                 Months Ended                        September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Operating Revenues                                                                      Fee income    $  62 				       $  59 				     5% 				       $  184 				       $  172 				     7% 				         Net investment income      207 				         207 				     0% 				         618 				         620 				     0% 				         Other revenues (1)      3 				         3 				     0% 				         11 				         8 				     38% 				         Total operating revenues      272 				         269 				     1% 				         813 				         800 				     2% 				         Operating Expenses                                                                      Interest credited      118 				         118 				     0% 				         354 				         351 				     1% 				         Benefits         -             -        NM             -          1 				       -100%          Commissions and other expenses      99 				         107 				       -7%          298 				         302 				       -1%          Total operating expenses      217 				         225 				       -4%          652 				         654 				     0% 				         Income (loss) from operations before taxes      55 				         44 				     25% 				         161 				         146 				     10% 				         Federal income tax expense (benefit)      15 				         11 				     36% 				         43 				         38 				     13% 				         Income (loss) from operations    $  40 				       $  33 				     21% 				       $  118 				       $  108 				     9% 				              (1)    Consists primarily of mutual fund account program revenues for mid to large employers.      Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:         ·    Lower commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking.    ·    Higher fee income driven by higher average daily account values.       Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:         ·    Higher fee income driven by higher average daily account values.     ·    Lower commissions and other expenses due to the effect of unlocking.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset by lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields and lower prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.        We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        See the Variable Account Value Information table within “Fee Income” below for drivers of changes in our variable account values and the Fixed Account Value Information table within “Net Investment Income and Interest Credited” below for drivers of changes in our fixed account values.       See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for more information on prepayment and bond make-whole premiums.       See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” for more information about unlocking.       Additional Information       We expect to continue making strategic investments during the remainder of 2014 to improve our infrastructure and expand distribution that will result in higher expenses.        Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented on our platform and terminating over the course of the year.        55       New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of future profitability. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the lapse rate, which compares the amount of withdrawals to the average account values. The overall lapse rate for our annuity and mutual fund products was 12% and 13% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to 14% and 12% for the corresponding periods in 2013.        Our lapse rate is negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Account Value Roll Forward table below as “Multi-Fund® and Other Variable Annuities”), which are also our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with much of the account values out of their surrender charge period. The proportion of these products to our total account values was 32% and 34% as of September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Due to this expected overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, a significant increase in new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels.       Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on a quarterly basis. Our ability to retain quarterly reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time interest rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A.

We charge expense assessments to cover insurance and administrative expenses. Expense assessments are generally equal to a percentage of the daily variable account values. Average daily account values are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Our expense assessments include fees we earn for the services that we provide to our mutual fund programs. In addition, for both our fixed and variable annuity contracts, we collect surrender charges when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge periods to protect us from premature withdrawals.

(2)    See “Realized Gain (Loss) and Benefit Ratio Unlocking” below.      Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following:         ·    Higher fee income attributable to growth in business in force and the effect of unlocking.    ·    Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by more favorable investment income on alternative investments and growth in business in force. These increases were partially offset by spread compression due to new money rates averaging below our current portfolio yields.      The increase in income from operations was partially offset primarily by the following:         ·    Higher benefits due to higher death claims attributable to growth in business in force, and the effect of unlocking.    ·    Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher margins than our model projections assumed and the effect of unlocking.       We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.        See “Consolidated Investments – Alternative Investments” below for more information on alternative investments.        See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL – Unlocking” for more information about unlocking.       Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain       Our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk-based capital (“RBC”) levels above current regulatory required levels. Term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (“XXX”) and Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”), respectively.  For more discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased XXX and AG38 statutory reserves associated with term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Legislative, Regulatory and Tax – Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations” and “Part II – Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain” in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow – Subsidiaries Statutory Reserving and Surplus” herein.        61       Our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by using long-dated LOCs as well as other financing transactions. Included in the LOCs issued as of September 30, 2014, was approximately $3.1 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance arrangements. Approximately $2.0 billion of such LOCs were issued for UL products containing secondary guarantees (approximately $1.8 billion will expire in 2031, and approximately $175 million will expire in 2018). Approximately $1.1 billion of such LOCs were issued for term business solutions (approximately $905 million will expire in 2023, and approximately $150 million is automatically renewable until 2023). We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of approximately $875 million to execute long-term structured solutions supporting UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market alternatives lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. An inability to obtain the necessary LOC capacity or other capital market alternatives could affect our returns on our in-force term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees.  However, we believe that our insurance subsidiaries have sufficient capital to support the increase in statutory reserves, based on our current reserve projections, if such structures were no longer available. See the table in “Commissions and Other Expenses” below for the presentation of our expenses associated with reserve financing.       Additional Information       We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations.        For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk” herein and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses – Falling Rates” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Market Conditions – Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       Insurance Premiums       Insurance premiums relate to traditional products and are a function of the rates priced into the product and the level of insurance in force. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.        Fee Income       Details underlying fee income, sales, net flows, account values and in-force face amount (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Fee Income                                                                      Mortality assessments    $  357 				       $  333 				     7% 				       $  1,049 				       $  1,000 				     5% 				         Expense assessments      264 				         213 				     24% 				         736 				         644 				     14% 				         Surrender charges      11 				         15 				       -27%          39 				         46 				       -15%          DFEL:                                                                      Deferrals      (100 				   )      (68 				   )    -47%          (255 				   )      (220 				   )    -16%          Amortization, net of interest:                                                                      Amortization, net of interest,                                                                      excluding unlocking      67 				         48 				     40% 				         189 				         137 				     38% 				         Unlocking      52 				         15 				     247% 				         52 				         15 				     247% 				         Total fee income    $  651 				       $  556 				     17% 				       $  1,810 				       $  1,622 				     12% 				                    62                                                                                                                                                                    For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Sales by Product                                                                      UL:                                                                      Excluding MoneyGuard® and indexed UL    $  27 				       $  32 				       -16%        $  72 				       $  92 				       -22%          MoneyGuard®      43 				         44 				       -2%          116 				         143 				       -19%          Indexed UL      18 				         17 				     6% 				         52 				         37 				     41% 				         Total UL      88 				         93 				       -5%          240 				         272 				       -12%          VUL      44 				         36 				     22% 				         145 				         91 				     59% 				         COLI and BOLI      5 				         15 				       -67%          23 				         80 				       -71%          Term      23 				         24 				       -4%          69 				         63 				     10% 				         Total sales    $  160 				       $  168 				       -5%        $  477 				       $  506 				       -6%                                                                                 Net Flows                                                                      Deposits    $  1,285 				       $  1,230 				     4% 				       $  3,859 				       $  3,723 				     4% 				         Withdrawals and deaths      (351 				   )      (368 				   )  5% 				         (1,177 				   )      (1,125 				   )    -5%          Net flows    $  934 				       $  862 				     8% 				       $  2,682 				       $  2,598 				     3% 				                                                                                Contract Holder Assessments    $  910 				       $  856 				     6% 				       $  2,645 				       $  2,545 				     4% 				                                                                                                          As of September 30,                       2014        2013        Change          Account Values                                      UL    $  31,245 				       $  30,284 				     3% 				         VUL      7,982 				         6,604 				     21% 				         Interest-sensitive whole life      2,277 				         2,269 				     0% 				         Total account values    $  41,504 				       $  39,157 				     6% 				                                                In-Force Face Amount                                      UL and other    $  322,416 				       $  315,763 				     2% 				         Term insurance      312,584 				         292,375 				     7% 				         Total in-force face amount    $  635,000 				       $  608,138 				     4% 				            Fee income relates only to interest-sensitive products and includes mortality assessments, expense assessments (net of deferrals and amortization related to DFEL) and surrender charges. Mortality and expense assessments are deducted from our contract holders’ account values. These amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and premiums received, face amount in force and account values. Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.        Sales are not recorded as a component of revenues (other than for traditional products) and do not have a significant effect on current quarter income from operations but are indicators of future profitability. Generally, we have higher sales during the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest.        Sales in the table above and as discussed above were reported as follows:         ·    MoneyGuard®, our linked-benefit product – 15% of total expected premium deposits;    ·    Single premium bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”) – 15% of single premium deposits;    ·    UL, VUL, and corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) – first year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received, including an adjustment for internal replacements of approximately 50% of commissionable premiums; and    ·    Term – 100% of annualized first year premiums.      Changes in the marketplace and continuing efforts to increase sales of higher return products in a low interest rate environment have resulted in a shift in our business mix.            63          Net Investment Income and Interest Credited       Details underlying net investment income, interest credited (in millions) and our interest rate spread were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Net Investment Income                                                                      Fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans                                                                      on real estate and other, net of                                                                      investment expenses    $  563 				       $  562 				     0% 				       $  1,690 				       $  1,672 				     1% 				         Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                                                       and bond make-whole premiums (1)      8 				         8 				     0% 				         33 				         26 				     27% 				         Alternative investments (2)      27 				         12 				     125% 				         56 				         28 				     100% 				         Surplus investments (3)      38 				         33 				     15% 				         113 				         99 				     14% 				         Total net investment income    $  636 				       $  615 				     3% 				       $  1,892 				       $  1,825 				     4% 				                                                                                Interest Credited    $  337 				       $  329 				     2% 				       $  1,008 				       $  973 				     4% 				              (1)    See “Consolidated Investments – Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account values because of the AG38 reserve requirements. Invested assets are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from AG38 reserve requirements.  These financing transactions lead to a transfer of invested assets from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our contract holders’ accounts. We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves for traditional products. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

Benefits for this segment include claims incurred during the period in excess of the associated reserves for its interest-sensitive and traditional products. In addition, benefits include the change in secondary guarantee and linked-benefit life insurance product reserves. These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of expense assessments causing unlocking adjustments to these liabilities similar to DAC, VOBA and DFEL.

When comparing DAC and VOBA deferrals as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, to the corresponding periods in 2013, the increase was primarily a result of changes in sales mix to products with higher commission rates.           66          RESULTS OF GROUP PROTECTION       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Group Protection (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 For the Three                 For the Nine                       Months Ended                 Months Ended                        September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Operating Revenues                                                                      Insurance premiums    $  550 				       $  516 				     7% 				       $  1,685 				       $  1,555 				     8% 				         Net investment income      45 				         41 				     10% 				         134 				         122 				     10% 				         Other revenues      3 				         4 				       -25%          10 				         8 				     25% 				         Total operating revenues      598 				         561 				     7% 				         1,829 				         1,685 				     9% 				         Operating Expenses                                                                      Interest credited      1 				         1 				     0% 				         4 				         2 				     100% 				         Benefits      428 				         382 				     12% 				         1,314 				         1,163 				     13% 				         Commissions and other expenses      157 				         142 				     11% 				         466 				         427 				     9% 				         Total operating expenses      586 				         525 				     12% 				         1,784 				         1,592 				     12% 				         Income (loss) from operations before                                                                      taxes      12 				         36 				       -67%          45 				         93 				       -52%          Federal income tax expense (benefit)      4 				         13 				       -69%          16 				         33 				       -52%          Income (loss) from operations    $  8 				       $  23 				       -65%        $  29 				       $  60 				       -52%                                                                                                                                                                           For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Income (Loss) from Operations by                                                                      Product Line                                                                      Life    $  6 				       $  10 				       -40%        $  13 				       $  16 				       -19%          Disability      2 				         11 				       -82%          12 				         41 				       -71%          Dental         -          1 				       -100%          2 				            -        NM          Total non-medical      8 				         22 				       -64%          27 				         57 				       -53%          Medical         -          1 				       -100%          2 				         3 				       -33%          Income (loss) from operations    $  8 				       $  23 				       -65%        $  29 				       $  60 				       -52%             Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to unfavorable total non-medical loss ratio experience attributable to a decline in long-term disability recoveries in 2014 and favorable reserve adjustments related to our long-term disability business in 2013.         We provide information about this segment’s operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.       Additional Information       Management compares trends in actual loss ratios to pricing expectations because group-underwriting risks change over time. We expect normal fluctuations in our composite non-medical loss ratios of this segment, as claims experience is inherently uncertain. During the third quarter of 2014, our total non-medical loss ratio of 77.6% was above our long-term expectation of 71% to 74% due primarily to a decline in long-term disability recovery experience. We expect the loss ratios to be at or above the high end of our target range during the remainder of the year. For every one percent increase in the loss ratio, we would expect an approximate annual $13 million to $15 million decrease to income from operations.        For information on the effects of current interest rates on our long-term disability claim reserves, see “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk.”       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A.

The premiums are a function of the rates priced into the product and our business in force. Business in force, in turn, is driven by sales and persistency experience.        Sales relate to new contract holders and new programs sold to existing contract holders. We believe that the trend in sales is an important indicator of development of business in force over time. Sales in the table above are the combined annualized premiums for our life, disability and dental products. When comparing sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, to the corresponding periods in 2013, the decrease was partly the result of pricing actions primarily on our employer-paid life and disability business. Through the first half of 2014, we also observed a slowing of industry sales. We continue to shift the business mix to employee-paid blocks of business, which we expect will improve the overall profitability of the business. The proportion of employee-paid sales to our total sales was 45% and 49% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to 43% and 46% for the corresponding periods in 2013.       Net Investment Income       We use our investment income to offset the earnings effect of the associated build of our policy reserves, which are a function of our insurance premiums and the yields on our invested assets.     68          Benefits and Interest Credited       Details underlying benefits and interest credited (in millions) and loss ratios by product line were as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Benefits and Interest Credited by                                                                      Product Line                                                                      Life    $  174 				       $  159 				     9% 				       $  539 				       $  484 				     11% 				         Disability      195 				         167 				     17% 				         571 				         474 				     20% 				         Dental      40 				         37 				     8% 				         122 				         114 				     7% 				         Total non-medical      409 				         363 				     13% 				         1,232 				         1,072 				     15% 				         Medical      20 				         20 				     0% 				         86 				         93 				       -8%          Total benefits and interest credited     $  429 				       $  383 				     12% 				       $  1,318 				       $  1,165 				     13% 				                                                                                Loss Ratios by Product Line                                                                      Life      75.9% 				         74.2% 				                 77.3% 				         77.1% 				                 Disability      80.8% 				         73.2% 				                 79.0% 				         70.8% 				                 Dental      70.8% 				         71.5% 				                 72.0% 				         74.3% 				                 Total non-medical      77.6% 				         73.4% 				                 77.5% 				         73.9% 				                 Medical      90.6% 				         88.3% 				                 88.9% 				         88.8% 				                    Commissions and Other Expenses        Details underlying commissions and other expenses (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Commissions and Other Expenses                                                                      Commissions    $  68 				       $  62 				     10% 				       $  202 				       $  187 				     8% 				         General and administrative expenses      73 				         76 				       -4%          223 				         220 				     1% 				         Taxes, licenses and fees      14 				         14 				     0% 				         43 				         39 				     10% 				         Total expenses incurred      155 				         152 				     2% 				         468 				         446 				     5% 				         DAC deferrals      (11 				   )      (20 				   )  45% 				         (45 				   )      (53 				   )  15% 				         Total expenses recognized before                                                                      amortization      144 				         132 				     9% 				         423 				         393 				     8% 				         DAC and VOBA amortization, net of                                                                      interest      13 				         10 				     30% 				         43 				         34 				     26% 				         Total commissions and                                                                      other expenses    $  157 				       $  142 				     11% 				       $  466 				       $  427 				     9% 				                                                                                DAC Deferrals                                                                      As a percentage of insurance premiums      2.0% 				         3.9% 				                 2.7% 				         3.4% 				                    Commissions and other costs that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized in relation to the revenues of the related contracts.

The level of expenses is an important driver of profitability for this segment as group insurance contracts are offered within an environment that competes on the basis of price and service.             69          RESULTS OF OTHER OPERATIONS       Income (Loss) from Operations       Details underlying the results for Other Operations (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 For the Three                 For the Nine                       Months Ended                 Months Ended                        September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Operating Revenues                                                                      Insurance premiums    $     -        $     -        NM        $     -        $  1 				       -100%          Net investment income      68 				         63 				     8% 				         211 				         192 				     10% 				         Amortization of deferred gain on                                                                       business sold through reinsurance      18 				         18 				     0% 				         54 				         54 				     0% 				         Media revenues (net)      17 				         18 				       -6%          49 				         53 				       -8%          Other revenues         -          1 				       -100%          1 				         4 				       -75%          Total operating revenues      103 				         100 				     3% 				         315 				         304 				     4% 				         Operating Expenses                                                                      Interest credited      22 				         26 				       -15%          74 				         82 				       -10%          Benefits      28 				         29 				       -3%          87 				         85 				     2% 				         Media expenses      15 				         15 				     0% 				         44 				         45 				       -2%          Other expenses      16 				         5 				     220% 				         33 				         56 				       -41%          Interest and debt expense      67 				         67 				     0% 				         201 				         196 				     3% 				         Total operating expenses      148 				         142 				     4% 				         439 				         464 				       -5%          Income (loss) from operations before taxes      (45 				   )      (42 				   )    -7%          (124 				   )      (160 				   )  23% 				         Federal income tax expense (benefit)      (16 				   )      (15 				   )    -7%          (44 				   )      (56 				   )  21% 				         Income (loss) from operations    $  (29 				   )    $  (27 				   )    -7%        $  (80 				   )    $  (104 				   )  23% 				            Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Loss from operations for Other Operations increased due primarily to lower other expenses in 2013 driven by the release of incentive compensation accruals. The increase was partially offset by higher net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by higher distributable earnings received from our segments, partially offset by repurchases of common stock and lower average invested assets.        Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013       Loss from operations for Other Operations decreased due primarily to the following:          ·    Lower other expenses attributable to the effect of changes in our stock price on our deferred compensations plans, as our stock price remained relatively flat during 2014 compared to significantly increasing during 2013 (see “Other Expenses” below for more information); and    ·    Higher net investment income, net of interest credited, related to higher average invested assets driven by distributable earnings received from our segments, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.      We provide information about Other Operations’ operating revenue and operating expense line items, the period in which amounts are recognized, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items and their associated drivers below.       Additional Information       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K.        Net Investment Income and Interest Credited        We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected.       The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or      70       loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.       Benefits       Benefits are recognized when incurred for Institutional Pension products and disability income business.

Interest and Debt Expense       Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

The realized gains were partially offset by losses on the mark-to-market on certain instruments during 2014 as compared to gains during 2013 attributable primarily to a decrease in interest rates leading to losses on derivative investments (not including those associated with our variable annuity net derivatives results).            72          Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 to 2013        We had realized gains during 2014 as compared to losses during 2013 driven primarily by the following components of excluded realized gain (loss), which we have described net of benefit ratio unlocking, after-tax:         ·    Gains on variable annuity net derivatives results during 2014 attributable to the effect of unlocking and a favorable GLB NPR component due to less narrowing of credit spreads, partially offset by less favorable equity market growth and more volatile capital markets during 2014 resulting in more unfavorable hedge program performance.     ·    General improvements in the credit markets during 2014 leading to a decline in OTTI.     ·    Higher gross realized gains related to certain investments during 2014 originating from asset sales to reposition the investment portfolio.

We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification       Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly-owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported.        We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.        74          Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios       Fixed maturity securities and equity securities consist of portfolios classified as AFS and trading. Mortgage-backed and private securities are included in both of the AFS and trading portfolios.       Details underlying our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios by industry classification (in millions) are presented in the tables below. These tables agree in total with the presentation of AFS securities in Note 4; however, the categories below represent a more detailed breakout of the AFS portfolio. Therefore, the investment classifications listed below do not agree to the investment categories provided in Note 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Consolidated Investments – Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Portfolios – Trading Securities” in our 2013 Form 10-K for further details.       AFS Securities       In accordance with the AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders’ equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized, and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to the balances of DAC, VOBA, DFEL, future contract benefits, other contract holder funds and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). For instance, DAC is adjusted upon the recognition of unrealized gains or losses because the        76       amortization of DAC is based upon an assumed emergence of gross profits on certain insurance business. Deferred income tax balances are also adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid.        The quality of our AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                         Rating Agency        As of September 30, 2014        As of December 31, 2013          NAIC        Equivalent        Amortized        Fair        % of        Amortized        Fair        % of          Designation (1)        Designation (1)        Cost        Value        Total        Cost        Value        Total                                                                                             Investment Grade Securities                                                                          1        Aaa / Aa / A        $  42,866 				       $  47,497 				     55.3% 				       $  41,483 				       $  44,129 				     54.6% 				         2        Baa          32,124 				         34,384 				     40.0% 				         31,897 				         33,060 				     41.0% 				         Total investment grade securities          74,990 				         81,881 				     95.3% 				         73,380 				         77,189 				     95.6% 				                                                                                            Below Investment Grade Securities                                                                          3        Ba          3,065 				         3,107 				     3.6% 				         2,603 				         2,627 				     3.3% 				         4        B          644 				         624 				     0.7% 				         701 				         668 				     0.8% 				         5        Caa and lower          336 				         305 				     0.4% 				         314 				         262 				     0.3% 				         6        In or near default          35 				         29 				     0.0% 				         37 				         29 				     0.0% 				         Total below investment grade securities          4,080 				         4,065 				     4.7% 				         3,655 				         3,586 				     4.4% 				         Total fixed maturity AFS securities        $  79,070 				       $  85,946 				     100.0% 				       $  77,035 				       $  80,775 				     100.0% 				                                                                                            Total securities below investment                                                                          grade as a percentage of total                                                                          fixed maturity AFS securities          5.2% 				         4.7% 				                 4.7% 				         4.4% 				                      (1)    Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, the second highest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of September 30, 2014.       Comparisons between the NAIC ratings and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality ratings and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated BBB- or higher by Fitch and S&P, or rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s), by such ratings organizations. However, securities rated NAIC 1 and NAIC 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC ratings 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s, or rated BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch).        As of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, 88.8% and 92.9%, respectively, of the total publicly traded and private securities in an unrealized loss status were rated as investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses, including the portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), on AFS securities as of September 30, 2014, decreased by $876 million. As more fully described in Note 1 in our 2013 Form 10-K, we regularly review our investment holdings for OTTI. We believe the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2014, does not represent OTTI as: (i) we do not intend to sell the debt securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; (iii) the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities; and (iv) we have the ability and intent to hold the equity securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. For further information on our unrealized losses on AFS securities, see “Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities” below.       Selected information for certain AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position (dollars in millions) as of September 30, 2014, was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                 Gross         Estimated        Estimated                                               Unrealized        Years        Average                                               Losses        Until Call        Years                                   Fair        and        or         Until        Subordination Level               Value        OTTI        Maturity        Recovery        Current        Origination      CMBS    $  122 				       $  14 				       1 to 39        14        3.5%            6.9%          Hybrid and redeemable preferred securities      207 				         37 				       1 to 52        21        N/A            N/A             77       As provided in the table above, many of the securities in these categories are long-dated with some of the preferred securities being perpetual. This is purposeful as it matches the long-term nature of our liabilities associated with our life insurance and annuity products. See “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2013 Form 10-K where we present information related to maturities of securities and the expected cash flows for rate sensitive liabilities and maturities of our holding company debt, which also demonstrates the long-term nature of the cash flows associated with these items. Because of this relationship, we do not believe it will be necessary to sell these securities before they recover or mature. For these securities, the estimated range and average period until recovery is the call or maturity period. It is difficult to predict or project when the securities will recover as it is dependent upon a number of factors including the overall economic climate. We do not believe it is necessary to impair these securities as long as the expected future cash flows are projected to be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of these securities.        The actual range and period until recovery could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. There are several items that could affect the length of the period until recovery, such as the pace of economic recovery, level of delinquencies, performance of the underlying collateral, changes in market interest rates, exposures to various industry or geographic conditions, market behavior and other market conditions.       We concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, that the estimated future cash flows are equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis of the debt securities, and that we have the ability to hold the equity AFS securities for a period of time sufficient for recovery. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considers the following as part of the evaluation:         ·    The current economic environment and market conditions;    ·    Our business strategy and current business plans;    ·    The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk;    ·    Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies;    ·    The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts;    ·    The capital risk limits approved by management; and    ·    Our current financial condition and liquidity demands.      To determine the recoverability of a debt security, we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following:         ·    Historical and implied volatility of the security;    ·    Length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost;     ·    Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area;     ·    Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and    ·    Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.       As reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had $103.2 billion of investments and cash, which exceeded the liabilities for our future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which totaled $88.6 billion as of September 30, 2014. If it were necessary to liquidate investments prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of $73.3 billion, excluding consolidated VIEs in the amount of $598 million, as of September 30, 2014, rather than selling securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the on-going cash flows from new and existing business.        See “AFS Securities – Evaluation for Recovery of Amortized Cost” in Note 1 in our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 4 for additional discussion.       As of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was $14.1 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively, representing 14% of total invested assets.       For information regarding our VIEs’ fixed maturity securities, see Note 3 in this report and Note 4 in our 2013 Form 10-K.        Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) (Included in AFS and Trading Securities)       See “Consolidated Investments – Mortgage-Backed Securities” in our 2013 Form 10-K for a discussion of our MBS.        Our ABS home equity and RMBS had a market value of $5.1 billion and an unrealized gain of $249 million, or 5%, as of September 30, 2014.            78          The market value of AFS securities and trading securities backed by subprime loans was $473 million and represented less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of September 30, 2014.  AFS securities represented $461 million, or 97%, and trading securities represented $12 million, or 3%, of the subprime exposure as of September 30, 2014.

Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management’s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of unrealized loss securities on our future earnings.            80       The composition by industry categories of all securities in unrealized loss status (in millions) as of September 30, 2014, was as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                         %                                                       Gross        Gross                           %                    %        Unrealized        Unrealized               Fair        Fair        Amortized        Amortized        Losses        Losses               Value        Value        Cost        Cost        and OTTI        and OTTI          Banking    $  720 				     5.8% 				       $  781 				     6.1% 				       $  61 				     11.5% 				         ABS      517 				     4.2% 				         563 				     4.4% 				         46 				     8.6% 				         Metals and mining      556 				     4.5% 				         597 				     4.6% 				         42 				     7.9% 				         Electric      1,094 				     8.9% 				         1,130 				     8.8% 				         35 				     6.6% 				         Technology      844 				     6.8% 				         873 				     6.8% 				         29 				     5.4% 				         Retailers      247 				     2.0% 				         273 				     2.1% 				         26 				     4.9% 				         Food and beverage      590 				     4.8% 				         613 				     4.8% 				         24 				     4.5% 				         CMO      607 				     4.9% 				         628 				     4.9% 				         20 				     3.8% 				         Pharmaceuticals      419 				     3.4% 				         436 				     3.4% 				         16 				     3.0% 				         Independent      634 				     5.2% 				         650 				     5.1% 				         16 				     3.0% 				         Chemicals      529 				     4.3% 				         544 				     4.2% 				         15 				     2.8% 				         Property and casualty      238 				     1.9% 				         253 				     2.0% 				         15 				     2.8% 				         Oil field services      294 				     2.4% 				         309 				     2.4% 				         15 				     2.8% 				         CMBS      142 				     1.2% 				         156 				     1.2% 				         14 				     2.6% 				         Consumer cyclical services      206 				     1.7% 				         219 				     1.7% 				         13 				     2.4% 				         Media – entertainment      303 				     2.5% 				         314 				     2.4% 				         12 				     2.3% 				         Industries with unrealized losses                                                                  less than $10 million      4,367 				     35.5% 				         4,501 				     35.1% 				         134 				     25.1% 				         Total by industry    $  12,307 				     100.0% 				       $  12,840 				     100.0% 				       $  533 				     100.0% 				                                                                            Total by industry as a percentage                                                                  of total AFS securities      14.3% 				                 16.2% 				                 100.0% 				                    As of September 30, 2014, the amortized cost and fair value of securities subject to enhanced analysis and monitoring for potential changes in unrealized loss status was $342 million and $272 million, respectively.

experienced a period of extreme volatility and disruption that began in the second half of 2007 and continued and substantially increased throughout 2008 that led to a decrease in the overall liquidity and availability of capital in the mortgage loan market, and in particular a decrease in activity by securitization lenders. These conditions and the overall economic downturn put pressure on the fundamentals of mortgage loans through rising vacancies, falling rents and falling property values.        82       See Note 4 for information regarding our loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios and our allowance for loan losses.       As of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, there were three impaired mortgage loans on real estate, or less than 1% of the total dollar amount of mortgage loans on real estate. The carrying value of the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was $8 million, or less than 1% of total mortgage loans on real estate. The total principal and interest past due on the mortgage loans on real estate that were two or more payments delinquent as of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was $5 million. See Note 1 in our 2013 Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policy relating to the impairment of mortgage loans on real estate.

As of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, alternative investments included investments in 152 and 121 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented approximately 1% of our overall invested assets. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in Other investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.       Non-Income Producing Investments       As of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate and real estate that were non-income producing was $9 million.            83          Net Investment Income       Details underlying net investment income (in millions) and our investment yield were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Fixed maturity AFS securities    $  1,010 				       $  997 				     1% 				       $  3,027 				       $  2,977 				     2% 				         Equity AFS securities      2 				         1 				     100% 				         7 				         4 				     75% 				         Trading securities      31 				         34 				       -9%          97 				         103 				       -6%          Mortgage loans on real estate      94 				         96 				       -2%          282 				         291 				       -3%          Real estate      1 				         3 				       -67%          6 				         10 				       -40%          Policy loans      37 				         40 				       -8%          115 				         117 				       -2%          Invested cash         -          1 				       -100%          1 				         3 				       -67%          Commercial mortgage loan prepayment                                                                       and bond make-whole premiums (1)      22 				         21 				     5% 				         69 				         79 				       -13%          Alternative investments (2)      46 				         18 				     156% 				         119 				         55 				     116% 				         Consent fees         -          2 				       -100%          1 				         3 				       -67%          Other investments      (4 				   )      (3 				   )    -33%          (12 				   )      (9 				   )    -33%          Investment income      1,239 				         1,210 				     2% 				         3,712 				         3,633 				     2% 				         Investment expense      (27 				   )      (30 				   )  10% 				         (85 				   )      (90 				   )  6% 				         Net investment income    $  1,212 				       $  1,180 				     3% 				       $  3,627 				       $  3,543 				     2% 				              (1)    See “Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums” below for additional information.

The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the contract holder on our average fixed account values, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.       Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums       Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.       84          Realized Gain (Loss) Related to Certain Investments       Details of the realized gain (loss) related to certain investments (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Fixed maturity AFS securities:                                                                      Gross gains    $  4 				       $  5 				       -20%        $  23 				       $  17 				     35% 				         Gross losses      (6 				   )      (28 				   )  79% 				         (18 				   )      (73 				   )  75% 				         Equity AFS securities:                                                                      Gross gains      2 				         1 				     100% 				         5 				         7 				       -29%          Gross losses         -          (1 				   )  100% 				            -          (2 				   )  100% 				         Gain (loss) on other investments         -          (2 				   )  100% 				         3 				         (3 				   )  200% 				         Associated amortization of DAC, VOBA,                                                                      DSI and DFEL and changes in other                                                                      contract holder funds      (7 				   )      (8 				   )  13% 				         (24 				   )      (19 				   )    -26%          Total realized gain (loss) related to                                                                       certain investments, pre-tax    $  (7 				   )    $  (33 				   )  79% 				       $  (11 				   )    $  (73 				   )  85% 				            Amortization of DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL and changes in other contract holder funds reflect an assumption for an expected level of credit-related investment losses. When actual credit-related investment losses are realized, we recognize a true-up to our DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL amortization and changes in other contract holder funds within realized loss reflecting the incremental effect of actual versus expected credit-related investment losses. These actual to expected amortization adjustments could create volatility in net realized gains and losses. The write-down for impairments includes both credit-related and interest rate-related impairments.       Realized gains and losses generally originate from asset sales to reposition the portfolio or to respond to product experience. During the first nine months of 2014 and 2013, we sold securities for gains and losses. In the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss reflects declines that are other-than-temporary, we consider our ability and intent to sell the security prior to a recovery of value. However, subsequent decisions on securities sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, assessing value relative to other comparable securities and overall portfolio maintenance. Although our portfolio managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell. These subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of our investment portfolio as AFS. We expect to continue to manage all non-trading invested assets within our portfolios in a manner that is consistent with the AFS classification.        We consider economic factors and circumstances within countries and industries where recent write-downs have occurred in our assessment of the status of securities we own of similarly situated issuers. While it is possible for realized or unrealized losses on a particular investment to affect other investments, our risk management strategy has been designed to identify correlation risks and other risks inherent in managing an investment portfolio. Once identified, strategies and procedures are developed to effectively monitor and manage these risks. The areas of risk correlation that we pay particular attention to are risks that may be correlated within specific financial and business markets, risks within specific industries and risks associated with related parties.       When the detailed analysis by our external asset managers and investment portfolio managers leads us to the conclusion that a security’s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the security is written down to estimated recovery value. In instances where declines are considered temporary, the security will continue to be carefully monitored.

The improvements of the write-downs for OTTI on our RMBS and CMBS holdings were primarily attributable to gradual recovery in both residential and commercial real estate markets.        The $25 million of impairments taken during the first nine months of 2014 were split between $14 million of credit-related impairments and $11 million of noncredit-related impairments. The credit-related impairments were largely attributable to our ABS home equity and RMBS holdings primarily as a result of weakness within select residential real estate securities. The noncredit-related impairments were due to declines in values of securities for which we do not have an intent to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery.       REINSURANCE       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Reinsurance” in our 2013 Form 10-K and “Part I – Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Reinsurance” in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, for a detailed discussion regarding our counterparty risk with our reinsurers, including collateral securing our reinsurance recoverable and rate increases sought by certain reinsurers, which information is incorporated herein by reference. For more information about reinsurance, see Note 9 in our 2013 Form 10-K.        REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow           Liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash from its normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our principal sources of cash flow from operating activities are insurance premiums and fees and investment income, while sources of cash flows from investing activities result from maturities and sales of invested assets. Our operating activities provided cash of $1.1 billion and $504 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. When considering our liquidity and cash flow, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries.        The sources of liquidity of the holding company are principally comprised of dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an SEC-filed shelf registration statement. These sources of liquidity and cash flow support the general corporate needs of the      86       holding company, including its common stock dividends, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, securities repurchases, acquisitions and investment in core businesses. Our cash flows associated with collateral received from and posted with counterparties change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. As the value of a derivative asset declines (or increases), the collateral required to be posted by our counterparties would also decline (or increase). Likewise, when the value of a derivative liability declines (or increases), the collateral we are required to post to our counterparties would also decline (or increase). During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our payables for collateral on derivative investments increased by $638 million due primarily to falling interest rates that increased the fair values of our associated derivative investments.

Details underlying the primary sources of our holding company cash flows (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Dividends from Subsidiaries                                                                      LNL    $  175 				       $  150 				     17% 				       $  515 				       $  450 				     14% 				         First Penn-Pacific         -             -        NM          20 				         40 				       -50%                                                                                 Loan Repayments and Interest from                                                                        Subsidiaries                                                                      Interest on inter-company notes      34 				         52 				       -35%          99 				         95 				     4% 				              $  209 				       $  202 				     3% 				       $  634 				       $  585 				     8% 				         Other Cash Flow and Liquidity Items                                                                      Net capital received from (paid for taxes on)                                                                       stock option exercises and restricted stock    $  23 				       $  1 				       NM        $  20 				       $  (2 				   )    NM             The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic issuance and retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program (discussed below). Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company.        Subsidiaries’ Statutory Reserving and Surplus       Like other life insurers, we utilize inter-company reinsurance arrangements with captives primarily to manage risk and statutory capital.  Captive reinsurers are typically special purpose vehicles that either by statute or by restriction in their licensing orders are limited to reinsuring business from insurance affiliates.  Specifically, captives help us mitigate the capital impact of XXX and AG38 reserving guidelines.  XXX and AG38 require insurers to use reserving assumptions that result in statutory reserves for term life insurance policies and UL policies with secondary guarantees greater than what we expect to adequately support these policies.  The captive reinsurance structures we use provide a mechanism for the financing of a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner.  This, in turn, frees up capital that the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including for paying dividends to the holding company.  Once transferred to the holding company, it can deploy this capital for a variety of corporate purposes, including potentially for stock repurchases.       Currently, insurance companies are using a wide variety of captive reinsurance structures to support their respective businesses.  The NAIC through its various committees, task forces and working groups has been studying the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and has been evaluating the adequacy of existing NAIC model laws and regulations applicable to captives. Recently, the NAIC directed its various committees, task forces and working groups to develop draft regulatory changes based upon recommendations of its retained consultant for further consideration by the NAIC. Certain of these recommendations are expected to be implemented effective January 1, 2015. We believe that, ultimately, if adopted by the NAIC and the states, those changes will allow for the continued use of captive structures, although certain types of captive structures may be limited or prohibited or the benefits of certain captive structures reduced.  We also believe that existing captive structures, which have been approved by the insurance departments of both the ceding company’s and captive’s states of domicile, will not be affected materially by the NAIC’s final actions.        There remains uncertainty to what extent the NAIC and the state regulators will require changes to future captive reinsurance structures.  If we are unable to continue to implement such captive structures, or if changes make the use of future structures less capital efficient, we may have lower returns on such products sold than we currently anticipate and/or raise prices or reduce our sales of these products.  As a result, our insurance subsidiaries may have lower capacity to provide dividends to the holding company.       For more discussion of our strategies to lessen the burden of increased XXX and AG38 statutory reserves associated with term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees on our insurance subsidiaries, see “Results of Life Insurance – Income (Loss) from Operations – Strategies to Address Statutory Reserve Strain.”   Financing Activities       87       Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically we may issue debt or equity securities to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of our debt and equity securities.        We currently have an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, depository shares and trust preferred securities of our affiliated trusts.        Details underlying debt and financing activities (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                     For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014                                       Maturities,        Change                                                                       Repayments        in Fair                                           Beginning                         and         Value            Other            Ending           Balance        Issuance        Refinancing        Hedges        Changes (1)        Balance      Short-Term Debt                                                                                          Current maturities of long-term debt (2)    $  501 				       $     -            $  (500 				   )        $     -            $  249 				           $  250 				                                                                                                Long-Term Debt                                                                                          Senior notes    $  3,609 				       $     -            $     -            $  116 				           $  (250 				   )        $  3,475 				     Bank borrowing       250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Federal Home Loan Bank of                                                                                           Indianapolis advance      250 				            -                 -                 -                 -              250 				     Capital securities      1,211 				            -                 -                 -                 -              1,211 				     Total long-term debt    $  5,320 				       $     -            $     -            $  116 				           $  (250 				   )        $  5,186 				          (1)    Includes the net increase (decrease) in commercial paper, non-cash reclassification of long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt, accretion of discounts and (amortization) of premiums, as applicable.    (2)    As of September 30, 2014, consisted of a $250 million 4.30% fixed-rate senior note maturing on June 15, 2015.      During the first quarter of 2014, we repaid a $300 million 4.75% fixed-rate senior note that matured on January 30, 2014, and a $200 million 4.75% fixed-rate senior note that matured on February 15, 2014. The specific resources or combination of resources that we will use to meet the June 2015 maturity mentioned above will depend upon, among other things, the financial market conditions present at the time of maturity. As of September 30, 2014, the holding company had available liquidity of $572 million. Available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.        For more information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities and LOCs, see Note 12 in our 2013 Form 10-K.       We have not accounted for repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, or other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets as sales and do not have any other transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For information about our collateralized financing transactions on our investments, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.       If current credit ratings and claims-paying ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our counterparties, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S&P/Moody’s). Our long-term senior debt held a rating of A-/Baa1 (S&P/Moody’s) as of September 30, 2014. In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Liquidity and Capital Position – A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings” and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors – Covenants and Ratings – A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” in our 2013 Form 10-K for more information. See “Part I – Item 1. Business – Financial Strength Ratings” in our 2013 Form 10-K for additional information on our current financial strength ratings.       See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities” in our 2013 Form 10-K for information on our credit ratings.           88          Alternative Sources of Liquidity       In order to manage our capital more efficiently, we have an inter-company cash management program where certain subsidiaries can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. The cash management program is essentially a series of demand loans between LNC and participating subsidiaries that reduces overall borrowing costs by allowing LNC and its subsidiaries to access internal resources instead of incurring third-party transaction costs. As of September 30, 2014, the holding company had a net outstanding receivable of $212 million from certain subsidiaries resulting from funds borrowed by the subsidiaries in excess of amounts placed by those subsidiaries in the inter-company cash management account. Any change in holding company cash management program balances is offset by the immediate and equal change in holding company cash and invested cash. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3% of the insurance company’s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2% of its admitted assets as of the last year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.       Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can access liquidity through securities lending programs and repurchase agreements. As of September 30, 2014, our insurance subsidiaries had investments with a carrying value of $2.6 billion out on loan or subject to repurchase agreements. The cash received in our securities lending programs and repurchase agreements is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. For additional details, see “Payables for Collateral on Investments” in Note 4.       For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above and “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       Divestitures       For a discussion of our divestitures, see Note 3 in our 2013 Form 10-K.       Uses of Capital       Our principal uses of cash are to pay policy claims and benefits, operating expenses, commissions and taxes, to purchase new investments, to purchase reinsurance, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our stock and debt securities.        Return of Capital to Common Stockholders        One of the Company’s primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchase depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Free cash flow for the holding company generally represents the amount of dividends and interest received from subsidiaries less interest paid on debt.       Details underlying this activity (in millions, except per share data), were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Common dividends to stockholders    $  42 				       $  32 				     31% 				       $  126 				       $  97 				     30% 				         Repurchase of common stock      150 				         100 				     50% 				         450 				         350 				     29% 				         Total cash returned to stockholders    $  192 				       $  132 				     45% 				       $  576 				       $  447 				     29% 				                                                                                Number of shares repurchased      2.846 				         2.314 				     23% 				         8.911 				         10.010 				       -11%          Average price per share    $  52.75 				       $  43.24 				     22% 				       $  50.53 				       $  34.99 				     44% 				            On November 14, 2013, our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.12 to $0.16 per share. Additionally, we expect to repurchase additional shares of common stock during the remainder of 2014 depending on market conditions and alternative uses of capital. For more information regarding share repurchases, see “Part II – Item 2(c)” below.           89          Other Uses of Capital       In addition to the amounts in the table above in “Return of Capital to Common Stockholders,” other uses of holding company cash flow (in millions) were as follows:                                                                                                                                                             For the Three                For the Nine                       Months Ended                Months Ended                       September 30,                September 30,                       2014        2013        Change        2014        2013        Change          Debt service (interest paid)    $  64 				       $  63 				     2% 				       $  219 				       $  207 				     6% 				         Capital contribution to subsidiaries      5 				            -        NM          5 				            -        NM          Total    $  69 				       $  63 				     10% 				       $  224 				       $  207 				     8% 				            The above table focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, namely the periodic retirement of debt and cash flows related to our inter-company cash management account. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company.       Significant Trends in Sources and Uses of Cash Flow       As stated above, LNC’s cash flow, as a holding company, is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the insurance subsidiaries’ RBC and statutory earnings performance. We currently expect to be able to meet the holding company’s ongoing cash needs and to have sufficient capital to offer downside protection in the event that the capital and credit markets experience another period of extreme volatility and disruption. A decline in capital market conditions, which reduces our insurance subsidiaries’ statutory surplus and RBC, may require them to retain more capital and may pressure our subsidiaries’ dividends to the holding company, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. For factors that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K.        OTHER MATTERS       Other Factors Affecting Our Business       In general, our businesses are subject to a changing social, economic, legal, legislative and regulatory environment. Some of the changes include initiatives to require more reserves to be carried by our insurance subsidiaries. Although the eventual effect on us of the changing environment in which we operate remains uncertain, these factors and others could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section, see “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K and “Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language” above.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       See Note 2 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been implemented during the periods presented or that have been issued and are to be implemented in the future.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. By aggregating the potential effect of market and other risks on the entire enterprise, we estimate, review and in some cases manage the risk to our earnings and shareholder value. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, default risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. The exposures of financial instruments to market risks, and the related risk management processes, are most important to our business where most of the invested assets support accumulation and investment-oriented insurance products. As an important element of our integrated asset-liability management processes, we use derivatives to minimize the effects of changes in interest levels, the shape of the yield curve, currency movements and volatility. In this context, derivatives serve to minimize interest rate risk by mitigating the effect of significant increases in interest rates on our earnings. Additional market exposures exist in our other general account insurance products and in our debt structure and derivatives positions. Our primary sources of market risk are substantial, relatively rapid and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates or a sharp drop in equity market values. These market risks are discussed in detail in the following pages and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) presented in “Item 1. Financial Statements,” as well as “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).                           90       Interest Rate Risk         Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity       For information about the effect of interest rate sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Interest Rate Risk – Effect of Interest Rate Sensitivity” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       Interest Rate Risk on Fixed Insurance Businesses        In periods of low interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed-rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.        Prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals. However, we have recognized this risk and have been proactive in our investment strategies, product designs, crediting rate strategies and overall asset-liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment. For some time now, new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors, and we apply disciplined asset-liability management standards, such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue.       The following provides detail on the percentage differences between the September 30, 2014, interest rates being credited to contract holders based on the third quarter of 2014 declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate (in millions), broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments:                                                                                                                                                                         Account Values                           Retirement                                %                                Plan            Life                         Account               Annuities            Services        Insurance (1)        Total        Values          Excess of Crediting Rates over Contract Minimums                                                                          Discretionary rate setting products: (2)                                                                          Occurring within the next twelve months: (3)                                                                          No difference    $  8,618 				           $  9,777 				           $  31,452 				           $  49,847 				     71.1% 				         Up to 0.50%      1,639 				             461 				             452 				             2,552 				     3.6% 				         0.51% to 1.00%      1,188 				             151 				             34 				             1,373 				     2.0% 				         1.01% to 1.50%      856 				             15 				                -              871 				     1.2% 				         1.51% to 2.00%      593 				                -              458 				             1,051 				     1.5% 				         2.01% to 2.50%      777 				                -                 -              777 				     1.1% 				         2.51% to 3.00%      246 				                -                 -              246 				     0.4% 				         3.01% or greater      189 				                -                 -              189 				     0.3% 				         Occurring after the next twelve months (4)      5,880 				                -                 -              5,880 				     8.3% 				         Total discretionary rate setting products       19,986 				             10,404 				             32,396 				             62,786 				     89.5% 				         Other contracts (5)      2,131 				             5,240 				                -              7,371 				     10.5% 				         Total account values    $  22,117 				           $  15,644 				           $  32,396 				           $  70,157 				     100.0% 				                                                                                    Percentage of discretionary rate setting product account                                                                          values at minimum guaranteed rates      43.1% 				             94.0% 				             97.1% 				             79.4% 				                      (1)    Excludes policy loans.    (2)    Contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary.    (3)    The average crediting rates were 46 basis points, 2 basis points and 4 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Life Insurance segments, respectively.    (4)    The average crediting rates were 114 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates. Of our account values for these products, 27% are scheduled to reset in more than one year but not more than two years; 25% are scheduled to reset in more than two years but not more than three years; and 48% are scheduled to reset in more than three years.     (5)    For Annuities, this amount relates primarily to income annuity and short-term dollar cost averaging business. For Retirement Plan Services, this amount relates primarily to indexed-based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were 10 basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates, and 81% of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates.      The maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates. We devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios. We seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio.   Derivatives       91           See Note 5 for information on our derivatives used to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates.       Equity Market Risk       Our revenues, assets and liabilities are exposed to equity market risk that we often hedge with derivatives. Due to the use of our reversion to the mean (“RTM”) process and our hedging strategies, we expect that, in general, short-term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for deferred acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements and deferred front-end loads. However, earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Introduction – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – DAC, VOBA, DSI and DFEL” in our 2013 Form 10-K for further discussion of the effects of equity markets on our RTM.        Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity       For information about the effect of equity market sensitivity on our income (loss) from operations, see “Part II – Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Equity Market Risk – Effect of Equity Market Sensitivity” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       Credit Risk       We may use credit-related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit-related events, and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors. See Note 5 for additional information.        In addition to the information provided about our counterparty exposure in Note 5, the fair value of our exposure by rating (in millions) was as follows:                                                              As of        As of               September 30,    December 31,                   2014            2013              AA        $  18 				           $  (3 				   )          A          19 				             62 				             BBB          5 				             10 				             Total         $  42 				           $  69 				                See Note 5 for additional information on our credit risk.        Item 4. Controls and Procedures       Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act.       Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.                92       PART II – OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1.
